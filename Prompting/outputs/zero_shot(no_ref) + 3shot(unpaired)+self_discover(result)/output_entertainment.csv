Warning: Spoilers from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier season 1, episode 2 are discussed in this article.
It's time for the world to get to know our new Captain America.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's premiere episode ended with a cliffhanger that introduced John Walker (Wyatt Russell) as the U.S. government's pick to carry the shield and don the suit after Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). Now, in episode 2, John is doing what every newly cast star would do to earn the public's affection: He's made the promotional rounds.
John got a massive press tour, complete with ""Cap Is Back"" posters, to introduce him to the American public. It all culminated with an interview with Good Morning America on the football field of his old high school, where we got to know a little bit about his background, including his military career in counterterrorism.
""What I thought was interesting about John is that Steve was a soldier from a different era. They're both soldiers from different eras, and the era of John is very different than the era of Steve,"" Russell explains to EW. ""The type of military men who are going to Iraq and Afghanistan was different because the time was different, and the grey area now, you see everything. Everything's filmed. There's a much different way of fighting now. You go in guns blazing first and ask questions later.""
While Steve's internal compass was directed by moral and ethical obligations — ""fighting for something more than just getting the job done,"" as Russell puts it — John is more of a company man with the company being the United States military.
""John's the type of guy who's like, 'Look, you want me to do the job? I will finish the job for you,'"" Russell says. ""Sometimes that might require things in the grey areas where you are not comfortable but I am, and I need to be able to do my job.""
That dichotomy between the legacy of Steve's Cap and John stepping into this role results in an internal struggle for the newly minted hero. It's a question of identity, which trickles down to all the characters, including Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson and Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes.
There are questions of, ""Who am I in this suit?"" Russell elaborates. ""What does it mean to me? What does it mean to the people watching?""
""Everybody has this idea of imposter syndrome to a degree, like even Sam at the beginning,"" he adds. ""[Sam] didn't necessarily feel comfortable with being Captain America. He didn't feel right. Everybody deals with those things differently. So, it's a big difference between this guy [John] and Steve. He's a little bit more of a [jump in] head first type guy.""
In terms of how John fits into the rest of the story, Russell calls him ""a wrench that gets thrown into the whole deal."" Sam, he remarks, is on a ""hero's journey"" and getting to the point where he's ""a fully realized person."" ""I'm an obstacle in that,"" he says.
Russell didn't read much of the original Marvel Comics in preparation for the role. Part of that is because he was never a comic book guy growing up. None of his friends read comics, either. He was an athlete, a hockey player. Though he found the comic artwork of John informative for the physical approach to the role.
""Your shoulders are a bit more rolled forward,"" the actor notes. ""It's just a little bit more bull.""
John, in the comics, follows his family's footsteps by joining the army. Eager to serve his country and get in on the action, he agrees to undergo experimentation that gives him super strength and becomes known as Super-Patriot, wanting to emulate Steve Rogers. The character later becomes an official Captain America after Steve hangs up the shield for ethical reasons.
Russell didn't care to know much of this lore because The Falcon and the Winter Soldier wasn't so ""derivative"" of this exact comic book story. However, pieces of it, of course, carried over into the show. For one, actor Cle Bennett plays Lemar Hoskins, John's friend who became an enhanced fighter named Battlestar. In the series, Lemar is part of John's Captain America strike force. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier also makes mention of the Power Brokers. A corrupt entrepreneur who went by Power Broker (singular) in the comics is how John and Lemar both got their enhanced abilities.
Russell didn't watch any of the past Marvel movies until he landed the role, either. When he finally did, he realized why Evans was so good as Captain America.
""It's next to an impossible job as far as I'm concerned,"" Russell says. ""You're trying to be a character who's perfect. Then playing against that, of trying to be a character who's perfect but feels like he's not at all, he did an unreal job of towing that line.""

It was only after he landed the gig that Marvel Studios told him he’d booked the role of John Walker, who takes on the mantel of Captain America after Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) turns it down. Initially, Russell didn’t want it either.
Eventually, Russell came around, in part, as he explained to Variety, because Marvel made clear they didn’t want him to play Steve Rogers 2.0. Based on the vituperative fan reaction so far to John Walker on the show — as Russell says, “They just hate him!” — it’s safe to say Russell has effectively made his Cap quite different from Chris Evans’. Here’s what Russell had to say about picking up Cap’s shield, working with Mackie and Sebastian Stan, and what it was like to see his face meme’d across the entire internet.
It was honestly more of my interest in playing the character where you don’t want to do anything that’s been done before. Obviously, that wouldn’t be interesting. And then do I want to be the guy who’s — do I want to wear the Captain America suit, to be honest. It was like, wow, you know, I don’t know. That did have elements of what John Walker was [dealing with], and when they kind of explained to me where he was and what he was, it fit how I felt about it in a way. I thought that actually, it may be a good fit. I just felt the weight of, can I be what they’re gonna want me to be? Or are they gonna lose a bunch of money?
Yeah, I think in some ways, for sure. In John’s world, he looks up to Steve Rogers, and wants to embody that. When you’re seeing him do his version of it, is it really who John actually is? Or is John trying to be someone that he’s not?
The training was crazy. The shield is very heavy and awkward. You don’t know where to put your hand sometimes. And that’s why you have this incredible stunt team. They can do backflips off a 10 story building. Anything you ask them to do, they can pretty much do. So I worked a lot with my stunt performer, Justin Eaton. We worked on a lot of shield work and footwork and all kinds of things to try and prepare us to look like we knew what we’re doing.
I think there is a corporate aspect to the inception of his character as Captain America. I think that what you’re seeing now is him battling with, “How do I be me and deal with this corporation that is the U.S. government?” It’s the only corporation he’s ever worked for and it’s worked very well for him in his life. Now he’s in this different world where there’s a PR aspect to it. He’s just been working in the clandestine world, most likely, where nobody really knows what he’s doing but he’s getting the job done. And now it’s like, Okay, go do that as Captain America — and sometimes his version of getting the job done is a little bit not the same.
I didn’t know that, but I would love for that to pop in at some point. John Walker, the pro wrestler — bring it on! That was part of the problem with reading the comics. As soon as I started the Wikipedia rabbit hole search, it was like, this is a bad idea. There’s 19 different versions of him in different worlds with different people! In one, he gets sent to Canada? I don’t know what the hell’s going on. I’m just gonna read the script.
Yeah, they hate me in real life and I’m okay with it. [Laughs] No. They’re just funny, easy-going people. It makes it very easy to work with and try and be good. I can’t say enough good things about them. I said to Sebastian a year ago, I just felt very lucky to be brought into the Marvel world with those guys, because they made me feel really comfortable and confident and all the stuff that you would hope to feel.
I don’t have social media, but I’ve gotten some of the stuff sent to me from friends that were just too good not to see. The best one is the “Up” guy with with the helmet on. It’s fucking unbelievable. I mean, whoever did that deserves an award of some kind. It’s flattering. They just hate the guy. They just hate him! It was fun to be the Marvel punching bag for a little while.

""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"": Unpacking the Making of a New Captain America

 Warning: Spoilers Ahead for Episode 2

Wyatt Russell, the actor behind John Walker, is shedding light on what makes his Captain America tick. In a chat with EW, Russell delves into the nuances of his character, drawing parallels with Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and exploring the complexities of being a soldier in different eras.

""It's a tale of two soldiers,"" Russell remarks, ""each hailing from distinct eras, with contrasting approaches to combat and moral obligations."" The era of John Walker, Russell explains, is characterized by a blurred moral compass, where ""you go in guns blazing first and ask questions later."" This starkly contrasts with Steve's internal compass, guided by moral and ethical principles.

Russell's John Walker is a company man, driven by a desire to complete the job, even if it means venturing into grey areas. ""He's the type of guy who'll stop at nothing to get the job done,"" Russell says, ""even if it means toeing the line."" This dichotomy raises questions of identity, not just for John but also for Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).

""It's a struggle to come to terms with who you are in this suit,"" Russell notes, ""what it means to you, and what it means to those watching."" For John, it's about embracing the role, even if it means navigating the grey areas. Russell likens John's approach to ""jumping in headfirst,"" a far cry from Steve's more measured approach.

As the series unfolds, Russell's John Walker becomes an obstacle in Sam's hero's journey, forcing him to confront his own sense of identity. Russell himself drew inspiration from the comic book artwork, using it to inform his physical approach to the role. ""It's all about the shoulders – a bit more rolled forward, a bit more bullish,"" he observes.

Interestingly, Russell didn't delve deep into the Marvel Comics lore, opting instead to focus on the show's unique take on the character. However, nods to the original story, such as Lemar Hoskins (Cle Bennett) and the Power Brokers, are woven throughout the series.

For Russell, the role of Captain America was a daunting one, especially in the shadow of Chris Evans' iconic performance. ""It's an almost impossible job, trying to be a character who's perfect,"" Russell remarks. ""Evans did an unreal job of towing that line, and it's a tough act to follow.""

What's next for John Walker and the world of ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier""? Only time will tell.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Variety:

Wyatt Russell Dives into the Making of John Walker, the New Captain America

The highly anticipated second episode of Marvel's ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" series has finally dropped, and with it, the introduction of Wyatt Russell's John Walker, the government's latest pick to don the iconic Captain America suit. Russell sat down with EW to dish on what it takes to fill Steve Rogers' shoes and how his character differs from the original Cap.

According to Russell, John Walker and Steve Rogers are ""soldiers from different eras,"" with distinct approaches to military service. While Steve's moral compass was guided by a strong sense of ethics, John is more of a ""company man"" who will stop at nothing to get the job done.

""The type of military men who are going to Iraq and Afghanistan is different because the time is different, and the grey area now, you see everything,"" Russell explains. ""There's a much different way of fighting now. You go in guns blazing first and ask questions later.""

This dichotomy sets the stage for an internal struggle within John, as he grapples with the weight of being Captain America. ""Everybody has this idea of imposter syndrome to a degree, like even Sam [Wilson] at the beginning,"" Russell notes. ""He didn't necessarily feel comfortable with being Captain America. He didn't feel right. Everybody deals with those things differently.""

As for how John fits into the larger narrative, Russell describes him as ""a wrench that gets thrown into the whole deal."" Sam, on the other hand, is on a ""hero's journey"" to become a fully realized person, and John is an obstacle in his path.

Interestingly, Russell didn't delve deep into the Marvel Comics lore in preparation for the role. Instead, he focused on the physical aspects of the character, drawing inspiration from the comic artwork to inform his portrayal.

_INCORPORATING REFERENCES_

In a departure from the source material, ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" takes creative liberties with John Walker's backstory. While the character follows in his family's footsteps by joining the army in the comics, the series offers a fresh spin on his origin story.

The show also nods to other elements from the comics, including the appearance of Lemar Hoskins, John's friend and enhanced fighter, and the mention of the Power Brokers. However, Russell maintains that the series isn't strictly beholden to the comic book storyline, allowing for a more nuanced exploration of the characters.

As the series unfolds, it will be fascinating to see how John Walker's character evolves and how he measures up to Steve Rogers' legendary status. One thing is certain – Wyatt Russell has already made a lasting impression as the new Captain America.

**The Falcon and the Winter Soldier: Unpacking John Walker's Captain America**

In the wake of Steve Rogers' (Chris Evans) departure, the world is introduced to a new Captain America in John Walker (Wyatt Russell), the U.S. government's top pick to wield the shield. As the second episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier unfolds, Walker embarks on a massive press tour, complete with ""Cap Is Back"" posters, to win over the American public.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Russell delves into the complexities of his character, drawing parallels between Walker's military background and that of Steve Rogers. ""What I thought was interesting about John is that Steve was a soldier from a different era. They're both soldiers from different eras, and the era of John is very different than the era of Steve,"" Russell explains.

The actor highlights the distinct approaches to combat employed by the two characters, with Steve driven by moral and ethical obligations, whereas Walker is more of a company man, prioritizing the completion of his mission. ""John's the type of guy who's like, 'Look, you want me to do the job? I will finish the job for you,'"" Russell says. ""Sometimes that might require things in the grey areas where you are not comfortable, but I am, and I need to be able to do my job.""

This dichotomy between the legacy of Steve's Captain America and Walker's assumption of the role sparks an internal struggle for the newly minted hero. It raises questions of identity, not only for Walker but also for Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson and Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes. ""Everybody has this idea of imposter syndrome to a degree, like even Sam at the beginning,"" Russell notes. ""[Sam] didn't necessarily feel comfortable with being Captain America. He didn't feel right. Everybody deals with those things differently.""

In terms of his character's place within the larger narrative, Russell describes Walker as ""a wrench that gets thrown into the whole deal."" Sam, on the other hand, is on a ""hero's journey,"" gradually becoming ""a fully realized person."" ""I'm an obstacle in that,"" Russell remarks.

Interestingly, Russell didn't delve deeply into the original Marvel Comics in preparation for the role, citing his lack of familiarity with the medium. However, he did find the comic artwork informative for his physical approach to the character. ""Your shoulders are a bit more rolled forward,"" the actor observes. ""It's just a little bit more bull.""

The Falcon and the Winter Soldier takes creative liberties with the source material, but certain elements, such as Lemar Hoskins (Cle Bennett) and the Power Brokers, are carried over from the comics. Russell praises the show's ability to balance its narrative with the original story.

When asked about his approach to playing Captain America, Russell expresses admiration for Chris Evans' portrayal, acknowledging the challenges of playing a character who embodies perfection. ""It's next to an impossible job as far as I'm concerned,"" Russell says. ""You're trying to be a character who's perfect. Then playing against that, of trying to be a character who's perfect but feels like he's not at all, he did an unreal job of towing that line.""

0.2241379310344827,"Willie Garson's absence on the rest of And Just Like That… this season has been explained.
The actor, who portrayed Carrie Bradshaw's best friend Stanford Blatch, tragically died in September when the series was filming.
During the fourth episode of the Sex and the City revival, which dropped Thursday on HBO Max, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) was back in her old Upper East Side apartment after deciding to sell the one she shared with late husband John James Prescott, a.k.a. Mr. Big (Chris Noth).
While there, Carrie noticed an envelope with her name on it by the bed. As she opened it, she saw that it was a goodbye letter from Stanford, who appeared in the first three episodes of the season.
""Dearest Carrie, by the time you read this I'll be in Tokyo. I couldn't tell you — not without crying,"" the letter read in part. ""And you have had enough crying.""
Soon, Stanford's husband Anthony Marentino (Mario Cantone) appeared at her door and shared a few more details, but not before chiding her for taking up smoking again.
""You're smoking?"" he asked, to which she replied with another question, ""Stanford's in Japan?""
Anthony then sat Carrie down and showed her a video on his phone of a young girl dancing.
""That's Ashley,"" he explained. ""The 17-year-old Long Island TikTok star he manages. She's huge in Asia. She asked him to go on tour with her. I do not get her, but then I'm old, gay and not Japanese.""
""Well fine, good, sayonara,"" Carrie said. ""But why the dramatic note? 'By the time you read this, I'll be in Tokyo.' Who is he, the lost Bronte sister?""
""He said he couldn't bring himself to tell you he was leaving face-to-face after Big died,"" Anthony said.
""Right, and a note is so much more compassionate,"" she quipped.
""Oh you know Stanny, he hates to disappoint people ... in person,"" Anthony teased in response.
Carrie then told him that she would have preferred to hear the news from Stanford in person, despite her recent loss.
""Still, you know, if something good is happening in one of my friends' lives — and I'm assuming he considers this good — I want to know about it. No matter what is going on in mine. Good news or bad, I want to know,"" she said.
""Really?"" Anthony said. ""I got a letter too. He wants a divorce.""
""I don't get it. We were so happy,"" he added, a cheeky reference to the couple's constant bickering.
Garson died in September at the age of 57 after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the time, executive producer Michael Patrick King told PEOPLE that Garson's ""spirit"" and ""dedication"" were ever-present on the set of the revival.
""The Sex And The City family has lost one of its own, our amazing Willie Garson,"" King said. ""His spirit and his dedication to his craft was present every day filming And Just Like That... .""
""He was there — giving us his all — even while he was sick,"" he continued. ""His multitude of gifts as an actor and person will be missed by everyone. In this sad, dark moment we are comforted by our memory of his joy and light.""
Parker, 56, reflected on her friendship with Garson, which spanned over three decades, in an Instagram tribute following the news of his death. ""It's been unbearable. Sometimes silence is a statement. Of the gravity. The anguish. The magnitude of the loss of a 30 + year friendship,"" she wrote.
""Willie. I will miss everything about you. And replay our last moments together. I will re-read every text from your final days and put to pen our last calls,"" Parker continued.

**And Just Like That... Explains Willie Garson's Sudden Absence**

The Sex and the City revival has finally addressed Willie Garson's abrupt departure from the series. Garson, who played the lovable Stanford Blatch, tragically passed away in September, midway through filming.

In the latest episode of And Just Like That..., which dropped on HBO Max Thursday, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) returns to her Upper East Side apartment after deciding to sell the one she shared with her late husband, Mr. Big (Chris Noth). While there, she discovers an envelope with her name on it, containing a heartfelt goodbye letter from Stanford.

The letter, which appeared in the first three episodes of the season, reads: ""Dearest Carrie, by the time you read this, I'll be in Tokyo. I couldn't tell you — not without crying. And you have had enough crying."" Soon, Stanford's husband, Anthony Marentino (Mario Cantone), arrives at her doorstep, filling in the gaps.

Anthony explains that Stanford has embarked on a new adventure, managing a 17-year-old Long Island TikTok sensation named Ashley, who has become a massive hit in Asia. Carrie is taken aback by the dramatic nature of Stanford's goodbye note, but Anthony reveals that Stanford couldn't bear to tell her in person, given her recent loss.

The conversation takes a surprising turn when Anthony shares that he, too, received a letter from Stanford — one requesting a divorce. ""I don't get it. We were so happy,"" Anthony quips, referencing the couple's notorious bickering.

Garson's untimely passing at 57, following a battle with pancreatic cancer, sent shockwaves through the And Just Like That... production. Executive producer Michael Patrick King remembered Garson's ""spirit"" and ""dedication"" as an integral part of the set.

Sarah Jessica Parker, who shared a 30-year friendship with Garson, paid a heartfelt tribute to her late co-star on Instagram. ""It's been unbearable... Your absence is a crater that I will fill with blessing of these memories and all the ones that are still in recesses yet to surface,"" she wrote.

Mario Cantone, who played Stanford's partner, Anthony, also shared a moving tribute, saying he was ""devastated"" by Garson's passing. ""I couldn't have had a more brilliant TV partner... You were a gift from the gods, sweet Willie. Rest…I love you.""

WILLIE GARSON'S ABSENCE EXPLAINED IN 'AND JUST LIKE THAT...' EPISODE

The fourth episode of HBO Max's ""Sex and the City"" revival, ""And Just Like That…"", dropped on Thursday, offering a poignant explanation for Willie Garson's character Stanford Blatch's absence from the rest of the season.

Garson, who portrayed Carrie Bradshaw's (Sarah Jessica Parker) best friend Stanford Blatch, tragically passed away in September while the series was in production.

In the episode, Carrie returns to her old Upper East Side apartment after deciding to sell the one she shared with late husband John James Prescott, aka Mr. Big (Chris Noth). It's there that she discovers a goodbye letter from Stanford, who appeared in the first three episodes of the season.

The letter, read aloud by Parker, reveals that Stanford has departed for Tokyo to manage the career of 17-year-old Long Island TikTok star Ashley, who has become a huge sensation in Asia. The news is delivered by Stanford's husband Anthony Marentino (Mario Cantone), who shares a video of Ashley dancing on his phone.

Carrie is less than thrilled with the dramatic goodbye note, quipping that Stanford is ""the lost Brontë sister."" Anthony explains that Stanford couldn't bring himself to tell Carrie about his departure in person, given her recent loss of Mr. Big.

In a heart-to-heart, Carrie expresses her desire to hear about Stanford's good news, despite her own struggles. The conversation takes a surprising turn when Anthony reveals that he too received a letter from Stanford - one requesting a divorce.

Garson passed away in September at the age of 57 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. Executive producer Michael Patrick King praised Garson's ""spirit"" and ""dedication"" to the show, saying he was present on set every day, even while he was ill.

Sarah Jessica Parker paid tribute to Garson on Instagram, writing that her 30-year friendship with him was ""unbearable"" to lose. Mario Cantone also shared a heartfelt message, saying he was ""devastated"" by Garson's passing.

This disco-friendly lizard is in a get-up that Elton John himself would approve of. Here's to hoping this colorful contestant brings some ""Rocket Man"" to the Masked Singer stage.
Gramps joins the Monster Masked Singer family that previously included season 1's Monster and season 3's Miss Monster. With his walker (tennis balls and all!), little cap, and spectacles, this costume could not be any more adorable. The question is, is this person actually old? We'll have to wait and see to find out.
This mystical bird looks absolutely fierce and ready to slay the competition. The costume, with its bold red color and ornate detailing, feels reminiscent of last season's Dragon.
Natasha Lyonne, is that you? Jokes aside, this little cutie promises to be full of surprises. How this costume will actually work on the show should be interesting. But if this promo is anything to go by, it should be entertaining!
Is this the evil twin to season 3's white Swan (who turned out to be Bella Thorne)? We don't yet know how graceful this bird will turn out to be, but the fierce creature's sexy leather and feather costume is certainly on point.
Part mammal, part Terminator, this furry costume seems like it could be hiding someone beefy, but looks can be deceiving on this show. One thing's for sure: Those quills look dangerous. Hope the backup dancers give them a wide berth!
That's one shell of a costume! Last season The Masked Singer dipped under the sea for inspiration in the Jellyfish and Seahorse costumes. This season, this colorful collection of shells joins the fray, and we can't wait to sea who ends up being under the candy-colored mask.
This adorable friend's mountaineer meets lumberjack look would make Davy Crockett himself proud. Complete with a vest and a hat that has fish bones on it, this trash panda is already sure to be a season favorite.
The fully motorized costume (a first for the show!) is tiny but mighty. With its oversized top hat and big smile, this costume is even pretty darn cute... for a slug, anyways.
With its school-boy charms (a propeller hat! overalls!), the Piglet looks to be a good candidate for the costume this season that panelists Nicole Scherzinger and Jenny McCarthy say they most want to adopt. And are those bright blue eyes and rosy cheeks a clue perhaps? Only time will tell!","This disguised celebrity hopes to rise from the ashes and win the Golden Mask trophy. They won't only have to beat out nine other undercover stars, but also wildcard contestants who come in at the end of the episode and compete for a chance to take someone's spot.
The family affair continues when the grandfather of season 1's Monster (winner T-Pain) and season 3's Miss Monster (Chaka Khan) joins season 5.
The colorful reptile and their fellow contestants — not including the wildcard participants — boast a combined 26 Grammy nominations, nine multi-platinum singles, four Academy Award nominations, three Super Bowl appearances, six gold medals and two world records.
In a season 5 teaser, this character shows off their ability to multiply. But only one star can take home the Golden Mask trophy!
Judge Robin Thicke suspects this large rodent will ""stump a lot of people,"" he says in a season 5 first look.
Though this character won't compete, they'll make regular appearances to present clues. Their celebrity identity will, however, eventually be revealed.
Slow and steady might be the way to win it all for this shelled gastropod.
""If you listen close enough to her shell, you can hear Ken [Jeong]'s snort,"" Thicke teases in another preview of season 5.
Stand-in host Niecy Nash, who temporarily replaced Nick Cannon after he tested positive for COVID-19 when filming started, calls this bird ""the most celebrated black swan since Natalie Portman.""

0.3376623376623376,"California Dreams was better than Saved by the Bell. There, I said it.
Each week host Jeff Probst will answer a few questions about the most recent episode of Survivor: Game Changers. This week, he gives his on-the-scene and behind-the-scenes insight and reaction to Jeff Varner outing Zeke Smith as transgender.
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Okay, so clearly a lot to unpack here with Jeff Varner outing Zeke as trans on national television. Let's start with your initial reaction when Jeff said that at Tribal Council.
JEFF PROBST: I'm pretty sure my reaction was the same as viewers watching at home. I saw Jeff Varner turn to Zeke and make what was essentially a statement—vaguely disguised as a question: ""Why haven't you told anyone here you're transgender?"" On one hand, it was such a tiny moment… so simple and quiet… that I wasn't certain I heard what I heard. My brain had to rewind and play it back. And if you watch the reaction at Tribal, Zeke's tribemates seemed to go thru the same moment. They heard it… but had to process it… and then once it landed they responded quite vocally. And while they were sharing their feelings with Varner, I was still running it in my head. This… just… happened.
It seems everyone on the tribe—Tai, Andrea, Ozzy, Debbie, Sarah—had their moment of telling Jeff in very strong language that what he did was completely unacceptable. What did you make of what I would describe as their unified disgust at what had happened?
In 34 seasons of Survivor, I have rarely, if ever, personally commented on what is said or done in the game. But this is a unique situation that falls outside the normal boundaries. I cannot imagine anyone thinking what was done to Zeke was okay on any level, under any circumstances, and certainly not simply because there was a million dollars on the line. I think the response from the tribe, as it so often does, mirrors what the vast majority of society will feel. You just don't do that to someone.
Witnessing that moment was so powerful because from my seat at Tribal, I could see it all. Varner was in the middle of being attacked by angry tribemates while Zeke sat in the corner, outside of the action in what appeared to be a mild state of shock. It was one of the most surreal moments I've ever encountered on the show. From the outside, it looked and sounded like a regular Tribal Council but in reality, it was one of the most raw and painful studies of human behavior that has ever happened on Survivor.
Zeke was so composed in his response to what Jeff Varner did. How impressed were you with his reaction?
We knew Zeke was a tremendous storyteller with an amazing ability to take a specific moment from the game or life and give it a universal perspective. That's why we asked him back to play a second time. And yet I was still blown away by how he handled the entire situation. It was as if he had been preparing for this absolutely unpredictable, completely public, and incredibly vulnerable moment for his entire life. His composure was astounding. And when he connected the entire event to the word metamorphosis, I distinctly remember thinking—how in the world did you just do that?
I was also very impressed with the compassion Zeke showed Varner. I wonder if some people will say he shouldn't have hugged him or shouldn't have forgiven him. But as a viewer to that moment, I found his ability to still find some level of humanity for someone who had just injured him so severely, maybe his crowning moment.
And there is another moment that I hope was as inspiring for others as it was for me, and that was when Sarah told Zeke she was glad she got to know Zeke for who Zeke is and would never see him any other way. That moment—when a police officer from a conservative Midwest background without much exposure to the ""gay and lesbian and transgender world"" realized her own growth, her own metamorphosis, it completed the circle. This is how change and acceptance happens.
When you spoke with Zeke before his first season during the interview process, did the subject ever come up in terms of whether he planned to tell players he was trans and how he would handle it if someone brought it up?
My story with Zeke goes like this. I met Zeke in casting and loved him. I still have my original notes from that meeting. He was very engaging, gifted in his ability to manipulate with his words, and he wore this crazy Hawaiian shirt and had poofy hair. We knew we were doing Millennials vs. Gen X as a theme and we wanted him on the Millennials tribe immediately. It wasn't until after he left that I was told he was transgender. From that point forward we agreed that if his story was to be told, he would be the one to decide when, where, and how.
As for someone else bringing it up, Zeke was fully aware someone might suspect it or bring it up and he said, ""I will deal with it as it arises."" And I have to add it was never a question of Zeke being worried his story would come out. ,Zeke is a massive Survivor fan and his point with us was very clear—he wanted to be seen as a Survivor player. Not the first transgender Survivor player. I really respected that distinction and I understood it.
The tribe was clearly all shaken by this incident. How were you after Tribal Council finished?
I don't really remember a lot about my own feelings in the moments after Tribal. I remember feeling that Zeke seemed very centered when he left Tribal, despite what he had gone through and I believed his tribemates would help him work through things back at camp. But we were in touch with the producer on the beach that night to just ensure everything was going okay.
And then the other concern was Jeff Varner. Although I do not condone on any level what Varner did, I was still aware that he was without any of his support group of family and friends. He would be returning to Ponderosa, where voted-out contestants go, after making one of the worst decisions of his life. Fortunately, we have a full-time psychologist on staff who knows all of the contestants and is there to help them through any of the many things that come up on Survivor. I think those sessions in the days after the event helped Varner as he tried to make sense of everything.
Have you spoken to Jeff Varner at all since this incident and do you think he is genuinely mortified by what he did?
I spoke with Varner the day after it happened and I think he was still in a bit of shock. It was clear he was upset and the realization of it all was still washing over him. I do believe he wishes he could take the entire event back. I hope Varner is able to take this moment and turn it into something positive. People make mistakes. Granted this happens to be a pretty severe one, but as you saw even with Zeke—there is hope that something good can come from this. That would be my wish… that Varner will seize this as an opportunity to be a catalyst for positive change by owning his mistake and moving forward in a new direction.
Finally, we always take a sneak peek at what's coming up. I know we have a merge on the horizon. And I have to imagine the Nuku tribe will still be decompressing from what just happened.
I'm going to break tradition tonight and let the events of this very special episode breathe for a moment. But Survivor will be back next week… and someone will be voted out. The game continues.","Patrick Gomez is the Editor in Chief/General Manager of Entertainment Weekly. Formerly at People magazine and The A.V.

Survivor fans were shocked and appalled after contestant Jeff Varner outed his tribemate, Zeke Smith, as transgender in an attempt to paint him as ""deceitful"" on Wednesday's episode of the CBS reality competition.
""Trans people are a highly vulnerable population. We make easy targets. We're attacked a lot and I expected a lot more from Varner,"" Smith, 29, has told PEOPLE exclusively. ""But I think it's so great that you see his hateful tactics rebuffed with such amazing love and from such a diverse group that responds to him.""
Now, through tears, Varner, 50, speaks to PEOPLE about the events leading up to the outing, the ""shame"" he's been coping with since the event and what good he hopes will come from the ""horrible"" situation.
What were you feeling after watching your actions on TV last night?
It's hard to have lived through that two-hour tribal and have it condensed to 20 minutes and see how moments were cut out and connected. I think the editing was good. I think they did a good job with what they had to work with, but it's just very difficult.
I thought of his family and his friends watching that moment — I'm sad. I'm really angry at myself and I'm profusely sorry to everybody I offended, to Zeke, all the people out there who are hurting because of me. It was not my intention. It was never my intention. [Sobbing] My God, I'm crying. I've been crying all day and that's not something I want to do.
Have you spoken to Zeke at all since that tribal council?
We've been dealing with this since last July and being unable to talk about it has really been the worst. I've talked to Zeke on the phone several times and that's been really helpful and healthy. It helped the healing begin, but it really couldn't start until last night.
I love Zeke so much. He's just so smart and so well-spoken and I have no doubt he will turn this into a beautiful thing. Even if he feels the need to for whatever reason to do it at my expense.
When did you know Zeke was transgender?
I suspected Zeke was transgender from the moment I saw him. And there were clues here and there throughout the whole thing. We didn't know who Zeke was when he showed up. We didn't have the luxury of watching his first season. [Editor note: Season 34 began filming before season 33 aired.] I don't want to go into this whole this, that and the other about how I knew because I don't think that's respectful, not only to Zeke but to other trans people.
Why did you choose to out Zeke at tribal council?
There is no why. I don't know why. I still to this day don't know why. It was not something I ever saw as something that would be part of this game. I think you saw me say on the show that this was not about this game. There was no plot, no plan, no anything.
I was desperate and I was looking for a way out. The editing doesn't show that Ozzy — when it was all said and done and I said, ""I'm done. I'm going home. Let's just be friends and chat and tell me what's going on"" — he opened up and shared with me that he was in a secret alliance with Andrea and Zeke.
That's when I saw the opening. So when I go back to camp and am talking to everyone about deception, I wasn't thinking at all about trans. I think I was very clear to the producers who knew I was questioning Zeke's gender that it wasn't something that was relevant in the game. It wasn't something I went to tribal intending to use.
I was arguing to everyone at tribal that there was this secret alliance and that they were all being deceived. That's when Zeke spoke up. You don't see Zeke saying, ""There is no deception. Varner's not telling the truth. There is no deception."" [regarding the secret alliance.] And emotionally it just came out.
What did you expect the reaction to be?
I didn't have any expectations of how people would react. I had no expectation of how this was going to be a tool in the game. I didn't even realize I'd done anything wrong. I thought Zeke was out and loud and proud. Who comes on a reality show not once but twice with a secret like that and nobody knows?
That was my messed-up thinking at the time. I thought that the viewers knew and everybody knew. So when I was arguing at tribal and I say ""I thought everybody knew,"" I was talking about everybody at home watching.
I knew the six people in front of us didn't know and so it just — when it dawned on me that nobody knew at home and he's not out and that I am the reason he is now out, I just came unglued. I don't even really remember a lot of it. I just remember I felt two feet tall and everyone was screaming at me and shaming it. It was a horrible moment and I was so embarrassed. I couldn't apologize enough. You don't see all of that and I understand why you don't, I'm not complaining about the editing at all, but that's what my thinking was: there was no thinking.
Zeke seems to take more offense to the reasoning you presented about transgender people than he did about you outing him.
One of the things that breaks my heart the most is that that's one of the stigmas that trans people fight the most. People think trans people are out there deceiving and they're predators and they're hiding in bathrooms and stuff that's just not true. It's awful. We've got to stop that.
We have to stop discriminating and minimizing trans people. They are humans. [Sobbing again.] We have to acknowledge that humanity and their dignity and lift up their voices and never reduce them to the disgusting things all these bigots do and all these people who just don't know and are acting out of fear.
I hurt Zeke and that's something that I'll never get over. My heart is open to him today and if he is reacting in any negative way I give him the space to do that — I deserve that.
You posted an apology on Twitter after the episode aired. What went into writing that?
When I came home, I immediately went to my trans friends and I sat them down and I said, ""Here's what I did. Here's what happened and it was ugly it was so unfortunate."" But they know me and they know my heart. They know my soul and they know that's not who I am.
I worked with them to make sure that I am learning and growing and helping other people learn and grow because that's so important. I wrote that statement out of my own heart. I just sat down and wrote it one day. I knew it was the right thing to say and the right thing to do. It was real. It was from my heart and as genuine as it could possibly be.
I know that there are going to be haters out here that are just aren't going to buy anything I have to say. I have been reading and working a lot with Dr. Brené Brown, who is the shame expert in the world, and she's helped me understand that vulnerability is the antidote to shame. Just opening yourself up and being honest and genuine helps wash that shame away and it's just been so beneficial to me.
What has the reaction been from other Survivor contestants?
I've got some wonderful people in my life that have helped me through this moment. Sarah and I spoke last night about the growth in her world. She called me right before tribal. Ironically, out of all the people at that tribal, Sarah and Debbie have been the most supportive by reaching out.
Sarah explained to me that her family would probably have reacted the way a lot of hateful people in the world react just because of where she's from and what they're in the middle of. But now her family is sitting down and they are talking about it and they are sympathizing with trans people.
And I just hope that those kinds of conversations are happening all over the country. It's just so important that that's where we head. As bad as this is and as bad as I feel, I'm glad that's what's happened as a part of this.

134     Although the controversy surrounding Jeff Varner outing Zeke Smith as transgender has been simmering, it's finally reached a boiling point.

Each week, Jeff Probst, the esteemed host of Survivor, will delve into the intricacies of the most recent episode of Survivor: Game Changers. In this installment, he shares his on-the-scene insight and reaction to the explosive confrontation that has left audiences reeling.

EW: The obvious question on everyone's mind is: What was your initial reaction when Jeff Varner dropped the bombshell at Tribal Council?

JP: I must admit, my response was identical to that of the viewers at home. I witnessed Jeff Varner pose a seemingly innocuous question to Zeke, which, in reality, was a thinly veiled statement. The subtlety of the moment belied its profound impact, leaving me momentarily stunned and requiring a mental replay to process the gravity of the situation. The tribe's reactions mirrored my own, with their initial hesitation giving way to vocal indignation.

The collective outrage from the tribe, comprised of Tai, Andrea, Ozzy, Debbie, and Sarah, was palpable. What did you make of their unified disgust at Varner's actions?

JP: In my 34 seasons of Survivor, I've rarely felt compelled to comment on the actions of contestants. However, this incident transcends the boundaries of the game. I cannot fathom how anyone could justify Varner's actions as acceptable under any circumstances. The tribe's response, as it often does, reflects the prevailing sentiment of society. Simply put, you don't divulge someone's personal information without their consent.

The poignancy of the moment was underscored by Zeke's composure in the face of Varner's transgression. How impressed were you with his reaction?

JP: We were aware of Zeke's exceptional storytelling abilities, which enable him to distill complex experiences into universally relatable narratives. His poise was astounding, and when he connected the event to the concept of metamorphosis, I was left in awe. His capacity to forgive Varner and display compassion in the face of adversity is a testament to his remarkable character.

I also found Sarah's moment of introspection, where she acknowledged her personal growth and acceptance, to be profoundly moving. It epitomized the very essence of how change and acceptance occur.

Did you discuss with Zeke during the casting process whether he planned to reveal his transgender status to his fellow players and how he would handle the situation if someone brought it up?

JP: My initial encounter with Zeke was during the casting process, where he impressed me with his engaging personality and remarkable ability to navigate the complexities of the game. It wasn't until after his initial departure that I was informed of his transgender status. We mutually agreed that he would be the one to dictate the narrative of his story, should he choose to share it.

As for the possibility of someone else broaching the subject, Zeke was well-prepared to handle the situation, should it arise. What struck me was his desire to be seen as a Survivor player, rather than being defined by his transgender status.

The tribe was visibly shaken by the incident. How did you feel after Tribal Council?

JP: My primary concern was Zeke's well-being, and I was relieved to see him composed and in the company of his supportive tribemates. We also ensured that Jeff Varner received the necessary support, as he navigated the aftermath of his actions.

Have you spoken with Jeff Varner since the incident, and do you believe he is genuinely remorseful?

JP: I spoke with Varner the following day, and he was still grappling with the magnitude of his actions. While his mistake was egregious, I believe he is capable of growth and wishes to redeem himself. My hope is that Varner will emerge from this experience a changed person, using his mistake as a catalyst for positive change.

Finally, we have a merge on the horizon, and I'm sure the Nuku tribe will still be reeling from the aftermath of this event.

JP: I'll break with tradition and allow the events of this episode to resonate for a moment. Survivor will return next week, and the game will continue, with someone inevitably facing elimination.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of People magazine:

Exclusive: Jeff Probst Opens Up About the Most Emotional Tribal Council in Survivor History

In a shocking turn of events, Jeff Varner outed Zeke Smith as transgender during the latest episode of Survivor: Game Changers. As the host of the hit CBS reality show, Jeff Probst witnessed the drama unfold and is now sharing his thoughts on the emotional aftermath.

""I'm still trying to process what happened,"" Probst tells EW. ""When Varner made the comment, it was like time stood still. The reaction from the tribe was immediate and intense. It was one of the most surreal moments I've ever experienced on the show.""

Probst praises Zeke for his composure in the face of such a personal attack. ""Zeke handled the situation with grace and dignity. His ability to forgive Varner and show compassion was truly inspiring. It was a powerful moment that will stay with me forever.""

The host also acknowledges the impact of the incident on the tribe. ""The entire cast was shaken by what happened. It was a difficult moment for everyone involved, but it also sparked some important conversations about acceptance and respect.""

When asked about his conversation with Zeke before the season started, Probst reveals that Zeke was always in control of his own narrative. ""Zeke was clear about his desire to be seen as a Survivor player, not a transgender Survivor player. I respected his wishes and admired his courage in sharing his story with us.""

As for Varner, Probst believes he is remorseful for his actions. ""I spoke with Varner after the incident, and he was clearly upset. He wishes he could take back what he did, and I hope he can learn from his mistake and become a catalyst for positive change.""

The drama may be over for now, but Probst promises that the game is far from it. ""The merge is coming, and the Nuku tribe will still be reeling from what happened. It's going to be an intense few episodes, and I'm excited to see how it all plays out.""

Stay tuned for more Survivor scoop and exclusives from Jeff Probst!","Here is the rewritten source document in the style of the reference document from People:

**California Dreams vs. Saved by the Bell: The Ultimate Showdown**

In a bold move, I'm declaring California Dreams the superior show to Saved by the Bell. Yes, I said it.

**Jeff Probst Dishes on Survivor: Game Changers**

Each week, host Jeff Probst answers our burning questions about the latest episode of Survivor: Game Changers. This week, he shares his on-the-scene insights and reactions to Jeff Varner's shocking outing of Zeke Smith as transgender.

**The Unpacking Begins**

ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Let's dive into the drama surrounding Jeff Varner's outing of Zeke as trans on national television. What was your initial reaction when Varner dropped the bombshell at Tribal Council?

JEFF PROBST: I'm pretty sure my reaction mirrored that of viewers at home. I was stunned when Varner turned to Zeke and made what was essentially a statement disguised as a question: ""Why haven't you told anyone here you're transgender?"" It was a tiny moment, but one that packed a massive punch. My brain had to rewind and replay it to process what had just happened. And judging by the reactions of Zeke's tribemates, they were just as shocked and outraged.

**A Unified Front of Disgust**

The entire tribe – Tai, Andrea, Ozzy, Debbie, and Sarah – were quick to condemn Varner's actions, using strong language to express their disgust. What did you make of their unified response?

In 34 seasons of Survivor, I've rarely commented on what's said or done in the game. But this situation is unique and falls outside the normal boundaries. I cannot fathom anyone thinking Varner's actions were acceptable on any level, under any circumstances. The tribe's response mirrored what the vast majority of society would feel: you just don't do that to someone.

**A Surreal Moment**

Witnessing that moment was incredibly powerful. From my seat at Tribal, I could see it all unfold. Varner was in the midst of being attacked by angry tribemates while Zeke sat in the corner, looking shell-shocked. It was one of the most surreal moments I've encountered on the show. On the surface, it looked like a regular Tribal Council, but in reality, it was a raw and painful study of human behavior.

**Zeke's Composure**

Zeke's response to Varner's actions was incredibly composed. How impressed were you with his reaction?

We knew Zeke was a talented storyteller with an amazing ability to take a specific moment from the game or life and give it a universal perspective. That's why we asked him back to play a second time. And yet, I was still blown away by how he handled the situation. It was as if he had been preparing for this unpredictable, public, and vulnerable moment his entire life. His composure was astounding. When he connected the event to the word metamorphosis, I distinctly remember thinking – how did he just do that?

**A Moment of Humanity**

I was also impressed by the compassion Zeke showed Varner. Some might say he shouldn't have hugged him or forgiven him, but as a viewer, I found his ability to still find humanity in someone who had just injured him so severely to be incredibly moving. And then there was the moment when Sarah told Zeke she was glad she got to know him for who he is and would never see him any other way. That moment – when a police officer from a conservative Midwest background realized her own growth and metamorphosis – completed the circle. This is how change and acceptance happen.

**The Interview Process**

Did the subject of Zeke's transgender status ever come up during the interview process, and how did you handle it?

My story with Zeke goes like this. I met Zeke in casting and loved him. I still have my original notes from that meeting. He was engaging, gifted in his ability to manipulate with his words, and wore this crazy Hawaiian shirt and had poofy hair. We knew we were doing Millennials vs. Gen X as a theme and wanted him on the Millennials tribe immediately. It wasn't until after he left that I was told he was transgender. From that point forward, we agreed that if his story was to be told, he would be the one to decide when, where, and how.

**Aftermath**

The tribe was clearly shaken by this incident. How were you after Tribal Council finished?

I don't really remember a lot about my own feelings in the moments after Tribal. I remember feeling that Zeke seemed very centered when he left Tribal, despite what he had gone through, and I believed his tribemates would help him work through things back at camp. But we were in touch with the producer on the beach that night to ensure everything was going okay.

**Moving Forward**

And then there was the concern about Jeff Varner. Although I do not condone what Varner did, I was still aware that he was without his support group of family and friends. He would be returning to Ponderosa, where voted-out contestants go, after making one of the worst decisions of his life. Fortunately, we have a full-time psychologist on staff who knows all of the contestants and is there to help them through any of the many things that come up on Survivor. I think those sessions in the days after the event helped Varner as he tried to make sense of everything.

**A Conversation with Varner**

Have you spoken to Jeff Varner at all since this incident, and do you think he is genuinely mortified by what he did?

I spoke with Varner the day after it happened, and I think he was still in shock. It was clear he was upset, and the realization of it all was still washing over him. I do believe he wishes he could take the entire event back. I hope Varner is able to take this moment and turn it into something positive. People make mistakes. Granted, this happens to be a pretty severe one, but as you saw even with Zeke – there is hope that something good can come from this. That would be my wish… that Varner will seize this as an opportunity to be a catalyst for positive change by owning his mistake and moving forward in a new direction.

**A Sneak Peek**

Finally, we always take a sneak peek at what's coming up. I know we have a merge on the horizon, and I have to imagine the Nuku tribe will still be decompressing from what just happened.

I'm going to break tradition tonight and let the events of this very special episode breathe for a moment. But Survivor will be back next week… and someone will be voted out. The game continues."
0.3,"Everything you think you knew was true on The Affair? Every theory you've come up with? Forget about it.
Of course, that's just the nature of the show, with its four point of views and four storytellers. Details, big and small, change. Memories are adjusted. Secrets are kept...even from the audience. And in tonight's episode, one of the Showtime drama's biggest mysteries was finally answered as the father of Alison's (Ruth Wilson) baby was finally revealed.
No, it wasn't her current husband Noah (Dominic West) OR her ex-husband Cole (Joshua Jackson). It was Scotty Lockhart (Colin Donnell), Cole's troublemaker brother whose murder is the show's central mystery. Or wait, is he?!
We never even saw Alison and Scotty hook up, right?! Well, that's because Alison never told us. While the audience assumed it was either Noah or Cole who was the father after it was revealed that Alison and Cole slept together, a key witness from the night of Scotty's death dropped the bombshell: Oscar (Darren Goldstein), the Lockhart brothers' longtime enemy (who also has a history with Alison).
After being paid $100,000 by Helen (Maura Tierney) for providing surveillance footage of Scotty and Alison having a heated discussion on the night he died, Oscar went one stop further revealing (with glee) exactly what the duo was arguing over. ""That's our baby,"" Oscar tells Noah's lawyer he overheard Scotty saying to Alison.
So when did Scotty and Alison have their tryst? Well, it had to be in the six weeks she didn't see Noah. Regardless, the huge revelation is just another reason someone could've killed Scotty. Was it Noah, after he found out his daughter actually isn't his? Or maybe Cole, enraged that his brother slept with his ex-wife, killed him? Then again, Alison could've been trying to prevent Scotty from telling anyone the truth. And we can't rule out Whitney (Goldani Telles), Noah's teenage daughter who was in love with Scotty (and aborted their child in season one).
Of course, that is if Oscar is even telling the truth. And if he is, did Scotty just mean that the baby is actually the Lockharts, as we found out that the family believes they are cursed when it comes to children, after Scotty and Cole's mother revealed their grandfather murdered a baby in Oscar's family back in the day?
Have we mentioned how much we love this show?
Who do you think is the father of Alison's baby: Noah, Cole or Scotty? Sound off in the comments!
The Affair airs Sundays at 10 p.m. on Showtime.

Love is rarely an act of true selflessness, though, and that’s what makes the finale of this second season so startling. The most selfless and caring act comes from the show’s most unlikely character … Noah.
I hate Noah Solloway more than I’ve hated any television character this year. He’s the embodiment of a virulent brand of masculinity that rarely gets checked, if ever. As we watch his perspective, which spans the first of the half of the finale, Noah frames himself in familiar ways: He believes he’s essentially a good and brave man, despite his selfish mistakes. The Affair has spent a lot of time casting Noah as the closest thing it has to a villain, yet the last scene of the season thoroughly absolves him. He stands up in the courtroom and confesses to the murder of Scotty Lockhart, a crime we know he didn’t commit. The ending is such a shock because, perhaps, Noah may be a better man than he previously seemed.
When the episode began, I was a bit taken aback by the return of Noah and Alison’s juxtaposed perspectives. The season has been strongest when it veered away from that standard, whether by turning toward the perspectives of Cole and Helen, or by showing the unvarnished truth. Nonetheless, The Affair has come into its own by sculpting the emotional landscapes of its wounded characters. Showrunner Sarah Treem, who handles writing duties for the finale, depicts many of the touchstones we’ve come to expect from the dueling perspectives: slight changes in wardrobe, radically different takes on essential moments, Noah’s inability to fully understand Alison, and Alison’s life being pulled in many directions. Where it matters most, Treem thankfully confounds our expectations: Alison confesses the truth about Joanie’s paternity to Noah, and the show finally reveals how Scotty died.
Vulture’s weekly newsletter of the best TV and movie recommendations.
Joanie’s paternity has loomed over Alison’s life, and thanks to Scotty’s ongoing threats, it was only a matter of time before she decided to tell Noah. From Noah’s perspective, the moment plays out in expected ways. As Cole and Luisa exchange vows, Alison is overcome with emotion and runs back to the Lobster Roll for solitude. Even if I didn’t believe Alison still harbors romantic feelings for Cole, anyone in her position would be overwhelmed. It’s a difficult, weird situation. Margaret paid for the entire wedding. Helen is a guest. She’s watching her ex-husband marry someone else, and Joanie is his child.
When Noah finds her, she finally tells him the truth. It’s a painful and emotional moment, but Noah’s reaction is particularly odd: “I never cheated on you,” he says. Which … isn’t exactly true. He didn’t straight-up sleep with Eden at the hedonistic party, but he crossed a line with her. Remember, on the book tour, when he let her into his hotel room? Neither his decency nor his decision to stay faithful put a stop to that — Eden simply decided she didn’t want to mix business with pleasure. Why doesn’t he count that as a transgression?
“Don’t take this the wrong way, but I never want to see you again,” he says to Alison, ending their confrontation. Even before this petty moment, though, he was treating her rather terribly. He can’t bear the idea of her life outside of the role he’s crafted for her.
For Alison, the confession takes a far more interesting shape. In one of the season’s best scenes, Scotty gets up onstage, ditching his sobriety, and sings a great take on “The House of the Rising Sun.” He’s trying to back Alison into a corner; moments beforehand, he low-key threatened her by asking about Joanie. As he sings, the tension builds and builds. It’s an ominous scene, made even more so by the red lights around the dance floor.
First spoken in a whisper, then after leaning closer to Noah, Alison declares, “Joanie is not your daughter.” No apology. No hysterics. We don’t see much of Noah’s reaction this time, but instead, the shot focuses on Alison’s face as his hand slowly slips from her shoulder. It’s a minute gesture, which makes the moment far more heartbreaking.
The ways each character remembers this scene are so vastly different, it’s almost unbelievable. It works, though, because of Ruth Wilson’s poignant performance and the careful crafting of each perspective. The cinematography is lush throughout the episode, and the decision to hold shots on Alison’s face during pivotal moments is especially smart. In the first season, Wilson appeared almost fetishistically morose. As the show and her character have grown, Alison’s sadness rings more truthful.
Back at the wedding, Scotty’s presence is a disruption even before he decides to start drinking. For a moment, I thought he would behave differently after three months in rehab, but he’s smarmy, selfish, and dangerous. The moment it becomes clear that Cole doesn’t want him to be an immediate partner, he unravels. He starts drinking again after one thing doesn’t go his way, proving Cole to be right.
We don’t see much of Cole in this episode, despite the importance of his wedding. The finale is squarely focused on the evolving dynamics between Alison and Noah. Cole and Alison do share a very tender moment, though, when he admits to her that Luisa can’t have children. This gives Alison the perfect opportunity to tell Cole about Joanie. Instead, she encourages him to commit to Luisa. Why take a chance losing someone you love? After all, love rarely comes in the perfect form you may desire. More than anything else, this scene allows Alison to say good-bye to her past with Cole. It’s heartbreaking.
And finally, we get to the tragedy. Scotty’s death (and the subsequent murder trial) has felt, at times, a peripheral part of the season. The mystery has rarely felt urgent, but the finale makes up for that lack of significance. Noah’s and Alison’s perspectives about the accident that killed Scotty match up; they just shine light on different details.
While driving Noah’s car, Helen strikes and accidentally kills Scotty. She and Noah are both drunk. The tender moment they have shared completely dissolves. The only thing they’re left with is Scotty’s bloodied body.
Alison’s perspective doesn’t contradict Noah’s account of the hit-and-run. Instead, it deepens the tragedy. As Alison walks down a darkened road, she’s confronted by a drunk Scotty, who still thinks he has leverage because of Joanie’s paternity. When his threats fail, Scotty sinks to a new low: He tries to rape her. During the struggle, she pushes him off her and straight into Noah’s car. Yes, Helen is driving. Yes, she tries to keep him in the car. But this time, we see Noah and Alison lock eyes when he goes to look at Scotty’s body. “I pushed him,” she whispers. The look between them is heavy with regret and fear. Yes, it was an act of self-defense, but it will irrevocably shift the shape of people’s lives. Alison and Noah could have told the truth before things unraveled the way they did. But, would Detective Jeffries or the people of Montauk have believed the truth? Would Helen have ever agreed to go along with it?
I kept wondering how Noah and Alison would stay together after she revealed Joanie’s paternity. Ultimately, the tragedy of Scotty’s death binds them together. When she goes back to the Lobster Roll — perhaps her only anchor of normalcy — Noah finds her. On the dance floor, their love carries a new, desperate edge. They need something to hold onto; everything is painfully shifting around them. The flash-forwards briefly suggest that Noah may sellout Alison in order to save himself, in light of new evidence found by Detective Jeffries that places her at the crime scene. Given how ugly things got between them after Alison’s confession, I thought that was a distinct possibility. After all, Noah admitted he didn’t want to have a child with Alison and initially believed that Joanie was an attempt to trap him. It’s the kind of blindly selfish, egotistical logic I’ve come to expect from Noah, which makes it all the more surprising to see him lie about killing Scotty to protect Alison and Helen.
Maybe it’s impossible for Noah to truly understand Alison. How well can we really know the people we love, after all? What if they don’t really understand themselves? Noah does see some of Alison, though, and he loves what he sees deeply enough to protect her — even at the cost of ruining his own life. When his love life goes awry, his instinct is to escape both emotionally and physically, but Scotty’s death binds him to Alison in inescapable ways. They’re both forced to realize how essential they are for each other.
I’ve never been a fan of Noah or his relationship with Alison. I tend to think Alison should be single, find some new friends, and develop a part of her life that really belongs to her. (That last part, at least, seems to be happening with the Lobster Roll.) After Noah’s public confession, though, the look they share amid the courtroom uproar goes a long way to justify their love.
“Can love save us?” seems to be the crucial question of the finale. It has no easy answers. Love is a fragile, dangerous thing on The Affair. Falling in love may not save yourself, but perhaps, it can help you save others.

131    Forget everything you thought you knew about The Affair. Every theory you've concocted about the Showtime drama's intricate web of secrets and lies? Toss them out the window.

That's the beauty of The Affair's narrative structure, after all - four distinct perspectives, four storytellers, and a constant flux of altering details and adjusted memories. Even the audience is occasionally kept in the dark, left to piece together the truth from fragmented flashbacks and cryptic conversations.

Tonight's episode, however, finally shed light on one of the show's most enduring mysteries: the paternity of Alison's baby. And it wasn't who we expected. Not Noah, her current husband, nor Cole, her ex-husband. The father, revealed with stunning casualness, was none other than Scotty Lockhart - Cole's trouble-prone brother, whose murder is the central axis around which the show's plot revolves.

But here's the thing: we never even saw Alison and Scotty hook up. Not once. Because Alison never told us. It took a key witness, Oscar, to drop the bombshell. And what a revelation it was: Oscar, the Lockhart brothers' longtime nemesis, revealed to Noah's lawyer that he overheard Scotty saying to Alison, ""That's our baby.""

So when did Alison and Scotty's clandestine tryst occur? Somewhere in that six-week window when she and Noah were estranged, presumably. But the implications are far more important than the logistics. This new development opens up a Pandora's box of motives and suspects. Did Noah, driven by rage and a sense of betrayal, kill Scotty upon discovering the truth about his daughter's parentage? Maybe Cole, fueled by a sense of brotherly loyalty and outrage, took matters into his own hands. Or perhaps Alison, desperate to keep her secret safe, silenced Scotty once and for all. And let's not forget Whitney, Noah's teenage daughter, who harbored her own secret feelings for Scotty.

But here's the rub: can we even trust Oscar's testimony? Is he telling the truth, or spinning a web of deceit to further his own agenda? And what did Scotty mean by ""our baby,"" anyway - was he referring to the Lockhart family's supposed curse, as revealed through Cole and Scotty's mother's shocking confession about their grandfather's dark past?

The Affair, as always, has left us with more questions than answers. And we can't get enough of it.

What do you think - who do you believe is the father of Alison's baby? Sound off in the comments below!

The Affair airs Sundays at 10 p.m. on Showtime.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Vulture:

""Everything You Thought You Knew About The Affair? Forget About It.

The Showtime drama is notorious for its tricksy storytelling, and last night's episode was no exception. The biggest mystery of the season was finally solved, and the father of Alison's (Ruth Wilson) baby was revealed to be none other than Scotty Lockhart (Colin Donnell), Cole's (Joshua Jackson) troublemaker brother. But, of course, things are never that simple on this show.

We never actually saw Alison and Scotty hook up, but Oscar (Darren Goldstein) dropped the bombshell: he overheard Scotty telling Alison that ""that's our baby."" So, when did this secret tryst go down? The possibilities are endless.

This revelation opens up a whole new can of worms. Was it Noah (Dominic West) who killed Scotty after finding out his daughter wasn't his? Or maybe Cole, who was enraged that his brother slept with his ex-wife? Or maybe Alison was trying to prevent Scotty from spilling the beans. And let's not forget Whitney (Goldani Telles), Noah's teenage daughter who was in love with Scotty.

But, in true The Affair fashion, we're left wondering if Oscar is even telling the truth. And if he is, what did Scotty mean by ""that's our baby""? Is the whole Lockhart family cursed when it comes to kids?

The Affair airs Sundays at 10 p.m. on Showtime. Sound off in the comments: who do you think is the father of Alison's baby?""

Note: I incorporated elements of Vulture's style, such as using a more conversational tone, injecting humor and irony, and using rhetorical questions to engage the reader.

The Affair's Latest Twist Will Blow Your Mind: Scotty Lockhart Is the Father of Alison's Baby

For weeks, we've been speculating about the paternity of Alison's baby on The Affair. Was it her current husband Noah, or perhaps her ex-husband Cole? Well, it's time to throw those theories out the window, because the truth is far more shocking. In tonight's episode, the Showtime drama finally revealed the father of Alison's baby, and it's none other than Scotty Lockhart, Cole's troublemaker brother.

Yes, you read that right. Scotty, the same Scotty whose murder is at the center of the show's mystery. But here's the thing: we never actually saw Alison and Scotty hook up. It was a secret she kept from us, and from the other characters. That is, until Oscar, the Lockhart brothers' longtime enemy, spilled the beans.

Oscar, who was paid $100,000 by Helen for providing surveillance footage of Scotty and Alison's heated discussion on the night he died, revealed that he overheard Scotty telling Alison, ""That's our baby."" But when did this tryst occur? It had to be during the six weeks Alison didn't see Noah. And what does this mean for the rest of the characters? Was it Noah who killed Scotty after discovering the truth about his daughter's paternity? Or maybe Cole, enraged by his brother's betrayal? Perhaps Alison herself was trying to silence Scotty. And let's not forget Whitney, Noah's teenage daughter who was in love with Scotty.

Of course, there's always the possibility that Oscar is lying. But if he's telling the truth, what does it mean for the Lockhart family's curse? As we learned, the family believes they're cursed when it comes to children, thanks to their grandfather's dark past.

The Affair is a show that loves to keep us guessing, and this latest twist is just another reason to love it. So, who do you think is responsible for Scotty's murder? Sound off in the comments!

THE SOCIAL NETWORK REUNION: DAKOTA JOHNSON RECALLS JESSE EISENBERG'S METHOD ACTING ANTICS

In a recent sit-down with Vanity Fair, Dakota Johnson reminisced about her early days on set with co-star Andrew Garfield, recalling a telling anecdote about Jesse Eisenberg's immersive approach to playing Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network.

Johnson, who appeared in a minor role as Amelia Ritter, remembered observing Eisenberg, 38, and Garfield, 38, during filming, noting the intensity with which they approached their characters. ""I spent a few days on set just watching,"" the 32-year-old actress recalled. ""I remember sitting down with you guys when you were having lunch one day, and you asked me loads of questions.""

However, Johnson diplomatically observed that Eisenberg, fully embracing his method acting technique, seemed less receptive to her presence. ""You were really nice—and Jesse didn't acknowledge me,"" she diplomatically stated, adding, ""He was probably in character.""

Garfield, quick to defend his co-star, offered a tongue-in-cheek explanation for Eisenberg's behavior. ""There was maybe some of the Zuckerberg coming through in that moment. He was probably overwhelmed by—"" the actor began, before Johnson chimed in, ""By your beauty, yes,"" provoking a laugh from Garfield.

Eisenberg's portrayal of Zuckerberg earned him widespread critical acclaim, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Johnson's own experience on set, though brief, left an indelible mark on her early days in the industry. As for Garfield, he fondly recalled a chance encounter with Johnson at an Oscars afterparty, praising her warmth and enthusiasm.

""I remember seeing you at the afterparty, and you were just so lovely and energetic and excited to connect, and I felt the same way,"" Garfield warmly recollected.

Dakota Johnson just spilled some major tea about working with Jesse Eisenberg on The Social Network. She sat down with her co-star Andrew Garfield for Vanity Fair and dished about what it was like being on set with Eisenberg, who played Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

""I was only in the movie for like, four seconds, but I spent a few days on set just watching,"" Johnson revealed. ""I remember sitting down with you guys when you were having lunch one day, and you asked me loads of questions."" But, awkwardly, Eisenberg barely acknowledged her. ""He was probably in character,"" Johnson laughed.

Garfield jumped to Eisenberg's defense, saying, ""There was maybe some of the Zuckerberg coming through in that moment. He was probably overwhelmed by..."" (dramatic pause) ""your beauty!""

Eisenberg's intense method acting paid off, though - he scored an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Zuckerberg. Johnson had a small but memorable role as Amelia Ritter, while Garfield played Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin.

The two actors didn't have any scenes together, but Garfield shared a sweet anecdote about bonding with Johnson at a party after the movie premiered.

Jessica is a staff writer at Entertainment Weekly, where she covers TV, movies, and pop culture. Her work has appeared in Bustle, NYLON, Cosmopolitan, InStyle, and more. She lives in California with her dog.
Veteran TV actress Denise Dowse, best known for her roles in Beverly Hills, 90210 and Insecure, among others, has died after a battle with meningitis. She was 64.
Dowse's sister Tracey shared the news in an Instagram post on Saturday. ""I want to take this moment to thank our friends and family for all of the love and prayers,"" she wrote. ""It is with a very heavy heart that I inform everyone that my sister, Denise Dowse has gone forward to meet our family in eternal life.""
She called Dowse ""the most amazing sister, a consummate, illustrious actress, mentor and director,"" adding, ""She was my very best friend and final family member. Denise loved all of you. I know that she is watching over us with all the love she has.""
More information about Dowse's celebration of life service will be shared at a later time, noted Tracey. ""Again I am so grateful for all the calls, text messages, direct messages, and silent prayers for my sister,"" she wrote. ""We could not have made it so gracefully and painlessly without all of the prayer warriors around the world.""
Tracey announced last week that her sister was hospitalized after she fell into a coma brought on by a virulent form of meningitis, a disease caused by the inflammation of brain and spinal cord membranes. ""She is a vibrant actor and director that should have many years ahead of her,"" Tracey wrote at the time. ""Thoughts, prayers and support are greatly appreciated.""
Denise's representatives did not immediately respond to EW's request for comment.
A fixture on '90s TV, Dowse portrayed West Beverly Hills High Vice Principal Yvonne Teasley on Beverly Hills, 90210, and made appearances on Seinfeld, California Dreams, Full House, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, ER, and Moesha, among others. Her dozens of other credits include Charmed, Secrets and Lies, Good Trouble, Stumptown, and, most recently, Insecure, as Molly's (Yvonne Orji) therapist Rhonda Pine.
On the film front, Dowse had roles in the Ray Charles biopic Ray opposite Jamie Foxx, Darren Aronofsky's psychological thriller Requiem for a Dream, and Dr. Dolittle opposite Eddie Murphy. She was also set to make her film directorial debut with Remember Me: The Mahalia Jackson Story, which follows the life and career of the gospel singer and activist who played an integral role in the civil rights movement.
On Sunday, Orji remembered her onscreen therapist as a ""delight and a pleasure to work with."" She wrote on Twitter, ""She embodied the strength and wisdom in real life that her character #DrRhonda shared with Molly. You will truly be missed and so fondly remembered.""
Ian Ziering, who starred opposite Dowse on 90210 as Steve Sanders, called the loss heartbreaking. ""Throughout all my years working on Beverly Hills 90210, my scenes with Denise will always be remembered with the utmost in respect for her talent, and fondness for the loving soul she was,"" Ziering wrote on Instagram. ""Some of my heartiest off camera laughs were between she and I hammering out the the discipline her Mrs. Teasley would dish out to my Steve Sanders.""","Nearly two weeks after the death of Denise Dowse, the Beverly Hills, 90210 family has lost another beloved member.
Joe E. Tata, who portrayed Peach Pit owner Nat on the TV series, has died, co-star Ian Ziering shared. Tata was 85.
""In the last few months we've lost Jessica Klein one of 90210's most prolific writers and producers, Denise Douse [sic] who played Mrs. Teasley, and now I'm very sad to say Joe E Tata has passed away,"" Ziering wrote on Instagram Aug. 25. ""Joey was truly an OG, I remember seeing him on the Rockford files with James Garner years before we worked together on 90210. He was often one of the background villains in the original Batman series.""
Ziering, who played Steve Sanders on Beverly Hills, 90210, went on to note that Tata was one of the happiest people he's ever worked with. ""He was as generous with his wisdom as he was with his kindness,"" Ziering added. ""Though the peach pit was a 90210 set, It often felt like the backdrop to the Joe E Tata show.""
""The stories of days gone by that he would share, incredible experiences in the entertainment industry that he was a part of would keep us all captivated,"" Ziering continued. ""He may have been in the back of many scenes, but he was a leading force, especially to us guys, on how to appreciate the gift that 90210 was. My smile dims today but basking in fond memories moves him from my eyes to my heart where he will always be.""
While a cause of death has not been publicly announced, Deadline reports that Tata was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease in 2018.
As Ziering's tribute mentioned, Tata's passing comes shortly after the deaths of fellow 90210 family members Klein and Dowse, who passed away on Aug. 13, days after she was hospitalized with severe meningitis.
""Throughout all my years working on Beverly Hills 90210, my scenes with Denise will always be remembered with the utmost in respect for her talent, and fondness for the loving soul she was,"" Ziering wrote on Instagram Aug. 14.

""There definitely was a point where I was like, 'I wonder what it would be like with an epidural, how it would be different,' "" she recalled. ""My midwife looked at me and was like, 'You're doing it. No one can help you. You're past the point of the epidural anyway, so you'd be pushing exactly the same way in a hospital bed.' ""
In addition to providing moral support, Hadid revealed that Malik was the one to catch their baby.
""It didn't even click that she was out. I was so exhausted, and I looked up and he's holding her. It was so cute."" Hadid said.
Hadid went on to share that while the couple are over the moon about becoming parents, they're not in a hurry to expand their family just yet. ""Afterward, Z and I looked at each other and were like, 'We can have some time before we do that again!' "" she added.

""As a model, especially at this point in my career, I'm happy for her to say, 'Gigi, will you be mad if I choose this slightly funky pose?' And I reply, 'Grace, I'm sick of seeing myself in the same way all the time, go ahead!' It really puts me in a different light.""
Grace told Vogue Italia's Francesca Ragazzi that Gigi ""was helpful, responsive, open to everything, as always"" during the shoot. ""And the team worked well together with the make-up artist and the hairdresser,"" she added. ""Eugene was brilliant.""

Vogue's March 2021 Issue: Gigi Hadid's Triumphant Solo Cover

Twenty-five-year-old supermodel Gigi Hadid has marked a significant milestone in her career and new chapter as a mother. The March 2021 issue of Vogue, hitting newsstands on February 16, features Hadid as the solo cover model, a testament to her hard work and dedication to the fashion industry.

In a heartfelt Instagram post, Hadid reflected on this achievement, sharing a tender moment with her daughter Khai, born in September to Hadid and her boyfriend Zayn Malik. ""Feeding my baby girl her morning bottle while sharing my first solo @voguemagazine cover is a surreal experience,"" the new mom wrote. ""I'm emotional and honored to take this professional step in my new chapter of womanhood. It's a dream come true!""

As she navigated this new chapter, Hadid acknowledged the people, memories, and experiences that have shaped her almost-decade-long career in fashion. She extended gratitude to stylist Gabriella Karefa-Johnson and editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, as well as a heartfelt shoutout to fellow moms who, like her, have been juggling the demands of motherhood.

Hadid's friends and family were quick to congratulate her on this career milestone. Her mother, Yolanda Hadid, commented, ""So proud of you, my Angel xo."" Model and friend Kendall Jenner added, ""Yay G!"" Fellow model and mom of two Lily Aldridge wrote, ""Yayyyyy love you so much,"" while mom-to-be Emily Ratajkowski affectionately called Hadid a ""beautiful mama.""

In her Vogue interview, Hadid opened up about her daughter's home birth, revealing that she had to ""dig deep"" during the delivery. With her boyfriend, mother, sister Bella, a midwife, and her assistant by her side, Hadid shared that Malik was the one who caught their baby. ""It didn't even click that she was out. I was so exhausted, and I looked up, and he's holding her. It was so cute,"" she recalled.

While the new parents are basking in the joy of parenthood, they're in no rush to expand their family just yet. ""Afterward, Z and I looked at each other and were like, 'We can have some time before we do that again!' "" Hadid said.

Although Hadid and Malik have been private about their daughter, the supermodel has enthusiastically shared glimpses into her life as a mom. Last month, she posted several updates about being a parent, including a sweet text exchange with her boyfriend. ""Hey... I'm obsessed w our kid,"" she wrote. Hadid also revealed her daughter's name, Khai, by updating her Instagram bio to read ""khai's mom.""","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Eonline:

Gigi Hadid Celebrates Major Milestone with Baby Khai

Supermodel Gigi Hadid is beaming with pride as she marks a significant milestone with her adorable daughter Khai. On Thursday, the 25-year-old stunner took to social media to reflect on her first solo Vogue cover, which hits newsstands on February 16.

""Feeding my baby girl her morning bottle while sharing my first @voguemagazine solo cover?!"" Gigi gushed. ""I'm emotional and honored to take my first professional step in this new chapter of womanhood with this dream come true!""

The new mom, who welcomed Khai with boyfriend Zayn Malik in September, went on to express her gratitude to stylist Gabriella Karefa-Johnson and editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. But she didn't forget to give a special shoutout to all the hardworking moms out there.

""I dedicate this to everyone who has lent me their time and talent in any way over the years, and to all the moms who haven't brushed their hair in a couple of days, either!"" she wrote.

Gigi's famous friends and family were quick to congratulate her on her career achievement. Her mom, Yolanda Hadid, commented, ""So proud of you, my Angel xo,"" while pal Kendall Jenner wrote, ""Yay G!"" Model and mom of two Lily Aldridge added, ""Yayyyyy love you so much,"" and mom-to-be Emily Ratajkowski lovingly called Gigi a ""beautiful mama.""

In her interview with Vogue, Gigi opened up about Khai's delivery, revealing that she had to ""dig deep"" during the home birth. ""When you see someone do that, you look at them a bit differently. I probably looked crazy, actually,"" she joked.

Gigi shared that her boyfriend, 28, her mother, sister Bella, a midwife, and her assistant were all by her side during the birth. ""There definitely was a point where I was like, 'I wonder what it would be like with an epidural, how it would be different,' "" she recalled. ""My midwife looked at me and was like, 'You're doing it. No one can help you. You're past the point of the epidural anyway, so you'd be pushing exactly the same way in a hospital bed.' ""

Gigi revealed that Zayn was the one to catch their baby, saying, ""It didn't even click that she was out. I was so exhausted, and I looked up and he's holding her. It was so cute.""

Although the couple is over the moon about becoming parents, they're not in a hurry to expand their family just yet. ""Afterward, Z and I looked at each other and were like, 'We can have some time before we do that again!' "" she added.

Gigi has been very private about her first child, but she hasn't been shy about singing Khai's praises. Last month, she shared several posts about being a parent, including a screenshot of a text message sent to her boyfriend. ""Hey... I'm obsessed w our kid,"" she wrote in the sweet exchange.

Gigi went on to reveal her daughter's name by changing the bio of her Instagram account to read, ""khai's mom."""

While speaking with E! News this week, Wright, 56, addressed recent rumblings about where things stand with Penn, 62, after the pair were spotted spending time together twice in Los Angeles last month.
""To be friends with the father of your children… I mean, it's a gift, because we know divorce with children is one of the most difficult things in life,"" the actress said.
""When you become estranged and become friends again … we were going to an event for our children,"" she explained of her recent public appearances with Penn, whom she was married to from 1996 to 2010.
Wright went on to say that she and Penn are ""always going to be a unit that way.""

""Sean has always said that Robin is the love of his life,"" the source said. ""He regrets many things that happened during their marriage. He really enjoys spending time with her now.""
Penn and Wright both recently ended relationships last year, with Penn finalizing his divorce from Leila George in April and Wright filing for divorce from Clément Giraudet in September after four years together.
The pair began dating in 1989 after Penn's divorce from Madonna; they had dated on and off for years before their marriage. Penn and Wright have two kids: son Hopper Penn, 29, and daughter Dylan Penn, 31.
In 2014, Wright told Britain's Telegraph that her divorce from Penn after a 20-year relationship was ""devastating.""
""Divorce in and of itself, and with children, is devastating. Worse than that,"" she said at the time. ""One of the reasons why we got back together and broke up so much was trying to keep the family together. If you've got kids, it's a family, and you try again, and you try again.""

The former couple made headlines last month after they were spotted in public together for the first time in six years. And according to Robin, their kids Dylan, 31, and Hopper Penn, 29, were the reason behind their recent reunion.
""We were going to an event for our children,"" the House of Cards alum exclusively told E! News' Francesca Amiker, adding, ""We're always gonna be a family, whether we're together or apart, you know, and I think that's beautiful and I wish that for everybody.""

And most recently, Robin got to play Hopper's on-screen mother in the upcoming drama Devil's Peak, which premieres Feb. 17.
As for whether fans will see the whole family on the big screen together in the future? ""Oh my gosh, wouldn't that be amazing?"" Robin delightfully shared. ""This is a family unit. We've always been a unit, and I hope that we'll always work together, one of us with the other or three of us or four.""
But for as much as Hopper says he ""loved working with his mom,"" he told E! News, ""I want to my own thing. Every movie I've done has been with a family member.""
Being the loving and encouraging mother she is, Robin responded to her son, saying, ""You will.""

After 20 years of marriage, the Outkast member and real estate entrepreneur's divorce has been finalized, according to court documents obtained by TMZ.
The musician, born Antwan Patton filed for the divorce in April, and the court reportedly entered the final divorce decree last month. His filing claimed there was ""no reasonable hope of reconciliation"" with Sherlita and the pair had already been living separately.
As part of the amicable divorce, they both reportedly agreed to not make any threats of ""injury, maltreating, molesting, harassing, harming, or abusing.""

31 Big Boi and Sherlita Patton's 20-Year Marriage Has Officially Ended

Outkast's Big Boi and his real estate entrepreneur wife, Sherlita Patton, have finalized their divorce after 20 years of marriage, according to court documents obtained by TMZ. The musician, born Antwan Patton, filed for divorce in April, citing ""no reasonable hope of reconciliation"" with Sherlita. The couple had reportedly been living separately, and their final divorce decree was entered last month.

As part of the amicable divorce, both Big Boi and Sherlita agreed to refrain from making threats of ""injury, maltreating, molesting, harassing, harming, or abusing"" each other.

The 47-year-old rapper and 49-year-old Sherlita tied the knot in March 2002 and share two children: daughter Jordan, 27, and son Cross, 21. Big Boi also has a 22-year-old son named Bamboo from a previous relationship.

Interestingly, this isn't the first time the couple has considered divorce. In 2013, Sherlita filed for divorce, claiming their marriage was ""irretrievably broken"" and seeking financial support and complete custody of their children. Big Boi responded by requesting joint custody of their then-12-year-old son Cross and claiming Sherlita was capable of supporting herself. However, the couple reconciled the following year, with Big Boi attributing their reconciliation to ""Jesus.""

In 2016, the couple privately signed a postnuptial agreement dividing their assets and debts. Despite their efforts to salvage their marriage, it appears their differences ultimately proved insurmountable.

As recently as 2019, Big Boi posted a heartfelt tribute to Sherlita on Instagram for Valentine's Day, gushing ""Happy Anniversary Baby Girl, Luv u Mrs. Patton"" alongside two photos of the couple posing together.

According to the court docs, Big Boi claimed there was ""no reasonable hope of reconciliation"" with Sherlita, and they'd already been living separately. The two agreed to keep things amicable, promising not to make any threats of ""injury, maltreating, molesting, harassing, harming, or abusing"" each other.

The couple tied the knot back in 2002 and shared two kids, Jordan, 27, and Cross, 21. Big Boi also has a 22-year-old son, Bamboo, from a previous relationship. This isn't the first time they've tried to call it quits, though - Sherlita filed for divorce in 2013, claiming their marriage was ""irretrievably broken"" and demanding financial support and full custody. But Big Boi fought back, and they eventually reconciled.

In 2016, they signed a postnuptial agreement, divvying up their assets and debts. And just recently, they agreed to a confidential settlement to tie up any loose ends. The exes are keeping their finances private, and it's clear they're both looking to move on with their lives.

We've got to give it to Big Boi, though - the guy's got a reputation for being a family man. He even gave God the credit for saving their marriage back in 2014.

**BIG BOI AND SHERLITA PATTON'S 20-YEAR MARRIAGE COMES TO AN END**

After two decades of marriage, Outkast's Big Boi and his wife Sherlita Patton have officially called it quits. According to court documents obtained by TMZ, the divorce has been finalized, putting an end to their 20-year union.

Big Boi, whose real name is Antwan Patton, filed for divorce back in April, citing ""no reasonable hope of reconciliation"" with his estranged wife. The couple had already been living separately, and it seems they've been able to keep things amicable. As part of their divorce agreement, both Big Boi and Sherlita have agreed not to make any threats of ""injury, maltreating, molesting, harassing, harming, or abusing"" each other.

The couple tied the knot back in March 2002 and share two kids together, 27-year-old daughter Jordan and 21-year-old son Cross. Big Boi also has a 22-year-old son named Bamboo from a previous relationship.

This isn't the first time Sherlita has filed for divorce from Big Boi. Back in 2013, she claimed their marriage was ""irretrievably broken"" and demanded financial support and full custody of their kids. Big Boi responded by requesting joint custody of Cross, who was just 12 at the time, and claimed Sherlita was capable of supporting herself. The couple eventually reconciled in 2014, with Big Boi crediting ""Jesus"" for their reunion.

In 2016, the couple signed a postnuptial agreement that divided up their assets and debts. And just a few years ago, Big Boi posted a sweet tribute to Sherlita on Instagram for Valentine's Day, calling her ""Baby Girl"" and expressing his love.

0.5555555555555555,"In ""Hogcock,"" part 1 of the finale, Liz was trying to acclimate to her new role as a stay-at-home mom. Jack tried to convince Lemon that she would go crazy without an outlet, but she was sure she could make it work. Further complicating matters, Liz started an all-out message board war with an anonymous Internet nemesis on the website, GothamMoms.com. As it turned out, her nemesis was her own husband, Criss, who was equally struggling in his new role as a working dad. So they decide to switch: Criss would stay at home, and Liz would pitch a new show to Kenneth. ""John Hardly. He loves his family, but he hates the rat race. He's: Hardly Working."" Kenneth turned her down, and instead gave her one last chance for TGS to make America say, 'What? Why?'"" A stipulation in Tracy's contract required that he appear in at least 150 episodes of TGS, or the network would owe him $30 million. They'd only done 149, so Kenneth insisted that Liz come back and do one more show.
Meanwhile, after nabbing his dream job, I assumed Jack would be pretty pleased. Unfortunately, he wasn't. Jack used his Six Sigma business principles—Analyze, Strategize, Succeed, or ASS—to ensure his own personal happiness. ""I'm going to crush this problem…with my ASS."" And his resolve seemed to work. Jack succeeded in all areas of his life: work, hobbies, family, philanthropy, faith, and even his relationships—which included bringing Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore) and Elisa Padriera (Salma Hayek) back for an open group relationship. In his short time as CEO, Jack had achieved so much, and even pissed off many of his enemies: ""Pelosi, Maddow, Baldwin."" (Nancy Pelosi appeared as herself on a fake MSNBC bulletin talking about how terrible Jack Donaghy was.) Yet he still couldn't reach true happiness. So Jack resigned as CEO. What the what?! He and Lemon got into a huge fight about the importance of work and their employee/boss relationship. Liz felt like he was bailing on her, and it seemed like it was the kind of fight they might not get over.
The top lines and moments from ""Hogcock!""
—Kenneth's list of TV no-no words: ""Conflict, Urban, Woman, Divorce, Shows about Shows, Writer, Justin Bartha, Dramedy, New York, Politics, High concept, Complex, Niche, Quality, Edgy, Blog, Immortal Character*, Foreign""
Liz: ""I do like ignoring your questions while I try to watch TV.""
NEXT: The epic part 2 conclusion!
The second half of the finale, ""Last Lunch,"" really delivered. Liz gathered the crew to shoot the final TGS episode. Unsurprisingly, Tracy wasn't making it easy. For example, he tricked Al Roker into announcing that ""Snowicane White Lady Name Like Dorva Or Something"" was going to hit midtown Manhattan to send the crew home. Reminiscent of 30 Rock's pilot, Liz had to go to a strip club to talk some sense into him. The real reason Tracy didn't want to go to the show was because he didn't want to face the goodbyes. Liz gave a heartfelt, honest speech, and convinced Tracy to come back. Lemon: solving problems until the very end.
The finale of 30 Rock would not have been complete without some Lutz hatred. It just so happened that he was the lunch picker for the day, and wanted Blimpie's. The rest of the writers tried to find a loophole to get a new picker, but he kept outsmarting them. Aardvark Lutz wanted his revenge for seven years of bad treatment. Once 5 p.m. rolled around, Liz took matters into her own hands: She locked Lutz into her office and ordered non-Blimpie's food. But Lutz escaped through the ceiling and ruined the food. The cast ended up eating Blimpie's after all. Throughout all of this, Pete kept making references to faking his own death, which he presumably did by episode's end.
But the real gem from ""Last Lunch"" was Jack Donaghy. Still reeling over his fight with Lemon, he was worried that she would hold a grudge against him forever. He was in such a bad place that his odd behavior eventually convinced Lemon that he might try to kill himself. And her fears were confirmed when she found his video suicide note. So she tracked his phone and found Jack getting ready to jump off a bridge. He jumped. She screamed and ran to the edge only to discover he landed on a boat. Jack tricked Liz so she would end her grudge, and then he could sail off on a journey to discover what makes him happy and find his bliss—not an acronym for Beautiful Ladies In Short Shorts.
Jack began a lengthy speech discussing a once-special word that was ""tragically co-opted by the romance industrial complex,"" but Liz cut him off: ""I love you too, Jack."" And since that's all there is to say, Jack went off into the night on his quest for self-discovery. But his trip was cut very short. ""Good God, Lemon! I just figured it all out. I'm turning around. Clear dishwashers!… So you can see what's going on inside it. It's the best idea I've ever had. Thank God I took that boat trip!""
The best lines and moments from ""Last Lunch""
—Lemon: ""So get up on that stage and cut the BS!""
Tracy: ""But I promised Barbra Streisand I'd never stab her again.""
NEXT: Did you really think I'd ignore the one year later?!
The tag at the end of the episode was great. It gave us a look at where everybody was one year later, and it looked like this: Paula discovered Pete's whereabouts, and forced him to come home. At least he got away with faking his death for a year. Grizz found success in his show, Grizz & Hers, which featured the line ""Don't even say it"" which he delivered to his dog. (Kenneth would have been proud.) Jenna won a Tony for Best Actress in a Musical… Only she really didn't. She was just stealing the thunder from the real winner, guest star Alice Ripley. But at least Jenna got to flash her boobs before making her final exit. Liz was working on the aforementioned show, Grizz & Hers, and her kids were on set with her. Looks like she really can have it all. Tracy's dad finally came back from getting cigarettes. And Jack was back in the office, probably even richer from his clear dishwasher idea, working with a beautiful assistant. Good riddance, Jonathan!
And then I freaked out a little, because when I saw Kenneth looking into a snow globe, I worried that they were going to pull a Newhart on us, and they would reveal the entire series had been a big dream. But the St. Elsewhere-style was even better than that. A Ms. Lemon was pitching the idea of a show that takes place at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, based on the stories her great-grandmother told her. Kenneth loved the idea, and then we saw the futuristic space cars flying past the window behind him. Kenneth will outlive us all, because I guess he really is immortal.
30 Rock had a lot of pressure to go out on top, and I think it managed to do just that. Part 1 of the finale was a little underwhelming, but not short on one-liners. And I've always said a less-than-stellar episode of 30 Rock is still one of the funniest shows on TV. ""Hogcock"" just set things up for a very rewarding ""Last Lunch,"" which featured a number of callbacks to some of the series' finer moments. I'm looking at you, Rural Juror. It was a smart nod to faithful viewers who followed the show through its good (""I want to go to there!"") and bad (Hazel Wassername) times. Did I love every moment of the finale? No. I could have lived without Pete faking his death, and I would have loved to see more Nancy and Elisa. But overall, the finale delivered a sense of closure that not all shows manage to accomplish. So thanks, 30 Rock. These really were the best days of my flurm.
Now it's your turn. Were you happy with the series finale? What was your favorite part? Least favorite part? And where does the ""Rural Juror"" song rank on your list of 30 Rock originals? For me it's somewhere between ""Muffin Top"" and ""Werewolf Bar Mitzvah."" Sound off in the comments.","It was already one of the smartest, fastest, most viciously funny sitcoms in television history, but somehow, in this final season, Tina Fey also gave 30 Rock enough heart to fill The Cosby Show seven times over. How else to explain the tears that flowed as Jenna Maroney/Jane Krakowski sang her closing song? What other show could have ever made us sob with the line “These were the best days of my flerm”?   Tonight’s finale managed to tie everything up with a neat little bow without ever dipping into treacly cliché, unless it was simultaneously holding up a neon sign that said TREACLY CLICHÉ. We got our moving farewells, we paid tribute to beloved minor characters (oh, Kathy Geiss, don’t ever stop crushing old people to death), the writers plowed through a closet full of unused material (“You Eastern European knockoff Mr. Potato Heads”), and we found out that the gang, with minor exceptions (sorry, Pete), actually ended up all right. Could we have asked for anything more? Hogcock!
That’s it for me, dear readers. The rest of the best punch lines, callbacks, killer dialogue, and emotional moments are up to you to leave in the comments. It’s been a genuine honor to recap the final season of this show for you — I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. And if not, the joke’s on you, cause I got paid anyway. Suck it, nerds!

130    ""Hogcock,"" the first installment of the 30 Rock finale, was a setup for something greater. Liz Lemon, now a stay-at-home mom, found herself entangled in an online feud with a mysterious nemesis on GothamMoms.com. Little did she know, her husband Criss was the mastermind behind the anonymity. As they swapped roles, Liz pitched a new show concept, ""Hardly Working,"" to Kenneth. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy was struggling to find happiness, applying his Six Sigma principles to his personal life.

134    The stipulation in Tracy's contract required him to appear in at least 150 episodes. With only 149 under their belt, Kenneth insisted Liz return for one more show. In the midst of it all, Jack's quest for happiness led him to an open group relationship with Nancy Donovan and Elisa Padriera. However, even with his remarkable achievements, he couldn't reach true happiness, ultimately resigning as CEO. This decision sparked a heated debate with Liz about the importance of work and their employee-boss dynamic.

137    Highlights from ""Hogcock"" included Kenneth's list of TV no-no words and Liz's clever response to ignoring his questions. The stage was set for the epic conclusion.

""The Last Lunch"" delivered, featuring Liz gathering the crew for the final TGS episode. Unsurprisingly, Tracy Jordan caused chaos, tricking Al Roker into announcing a fake weather alert.

141    The finale wouldn't have been complete without a nod to Lutz hatred. As the lunch picker, he insisted on Blimpie's, outsmarting the writers at every turn. Pete's references to faking his own death added a dark comedic tone.

142    Jack Donaghy stole the show, reeling from his fight with Liz. His behavior convinced her he might take his own life, leading her to track his phone and discover a video suicide note. However, Jack cleverly tricked Liz, ending his grudge and embarking on a journey to discover what truly made him happy. His speech about a co-opted word was cut short by Liz's admission of love, prompting Jack to sail off on his quest.

145    The best moments from ""Last Lunch"" included Tracy's promise to Barbra Streisand and Lemon's instruction to cut the BS. The tag at the end of the episode showed us where everyone was a year later: Paula found Pete, Grizz found success, Jenna won a Tony (or so she thought), Liz balanced work and motherhood, and Jack returned to the office with a clear dishwasher idea.

146    As I watched Kenneth gaze into a snow globe, I feared a Newhart-esque twist. Instead, the show cleverly fast-forwarded to a Ms. Lemon pitching a 30 Rock-inspired series, set at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, inspired by her great-grandmother's stories. Kenneth loved the idea, and as we saw futuristic space cars flying past the window, it became clear Kenneth would outlive us all.

147    30 Rock managed to go out on top, delivering a sense of closure. While not every moment was perfect, the finale was a smart nod to faithful viewers. Did I love every moment? No, but the show's ability to balance humor and heart is a rare feat.

Now it's your turn. Were you satisfied with the series finale? What was your favorite part? Least favorite part? Sound off in the comments.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Vulture:

The finale of 30 Rock was a wildly ambitious endeavor, aiming to tie up loose ends, revisit beloved characters, and still manage to cram in enough clever one-liners to make our heads spin. And you know what? It mostly worked. 

Part one, ""Hogcock,"" felt a tad like a setup for the real fireworks to come in ""Last Lunch."" Liz Lemon, now a stay-at-home mom, engaged in an all-out war with an anonymous troll on GothamMoms.com, only to discover it was her husband Criss, struggling to find his footing as a working dad. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy, fresh from his triumph as CEO, suddenly found himself mired in ennui, prompting him to resign and embark on a journey of self-discovery. Oh, and did I mention Tracy Jordan's contractual obligations, Nancy Pelosi's cameo, and Lemon's TV pitch, ""John Hardly""?

But the real pièce de résistance was ""Last Lunch,"" which delivered callbacks galore, from Rural Juror to a certain someone's penchant for faking their own death. The climax of the episode found Jack faking a suicide attempt to guilt-trip Lemon into forgiving him. It was a characteristically absurd move that, shockingly, worked. 

And then there was the one-year-later tag, which found our beloved characters scattered across the globe, from Pete's fake death to Jenna's Tony win (or was it?) to Jack's clear-dishwasher epiphany. It was a wildly satisfying conclusion to the series, one that managed to avoid the treacly clichés that often plague finales.

Of course, not every moment landed perfectly – Pete's fake death felt like a misstep, and I would've loved more Nancy and Elisa – but overall, the finale was a masterclass in balancing heart and humor. So as we bid adieu to 30 Rock, let's take a moment to appreciate the sheer comedic genius that was this show. As Lemon would say, ""I love you too, Jack.""","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Vulture:

Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced all five previous Pirates of the Caribbean movies, says there’s still a chance to resurrect the script of the cancelled female-led take on the franchise. The reveal comes from an exclusive interview with Collider’s own Perri Nemiroff for the upcoming Disney+ National Treasure series.
A female-led Pirates of the Caribbean was first announced in 2020 with Margot Robbie attached to lead the cast, and Birds of Prey scribe Christina Hodson was expected to write the script. Bruckheimer was also attached to produce, meaning the Robbie-centric sequel would most likely connect to the larger franchise. Unfortunately, that ship officially sunk earlier last month when Robbie revealed the project was never going to see the light of day. At the time, Robbie said, ""We had an idea, and we were developing it for a while, ages ago, to have more of a female-led—not totally female-led, but just a different kind of story—which we thought would’ve been really cool. But I guess they don't want to do it."" Who are “they” remain a mystery, especially considering how the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was so profitable for Disney.
Currently, it sounds like Bruckheimer is developing a different Pirates of the Caribbean movie, although little is known about the project. Ted Elliott, who wrote the scripts for the first four Pirates films, is supposedly attached to writing the sixth movie script together with Chernobyl creator Craig Mazin. However, very little is known about the movie’s plot or if it will bring back legacy characters from the original trilogy.
Based on the fan-favorite Disney theme park ride of the same name, the franchise began its successful run with 2003’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. The movie became a surprise hit, hauling over $650 million at the global box office. The movie also scored a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for Johnny Depp, who played the iconic pirate Jack Sparrow in Curse of the Black Pearl and all four sequels the movie got. The last movie in the franchise, 2017's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, was a critic failure and a box office bomb, which ultimately led the franchise to be buried in the sand. Robbie’s female-led movie could have been a treasure map, helping Disney to reignite the love for the franchise.
There’s no release date for the Pirates of the Caribbean movie currently in development. Check out our interview with Bruckheimer about the possibility of Depp returning to the franchise from an interview for his series Hightown.

""Dead in the water"" is, sadly, not the title of Margot Robbie's upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean movie — it's the status.
The Birds of Prey and Barbie actress has been attached to a more female-focused film in the fantasy-adventure franchise since 2020, but Robbie now says the pic is not moving forward at Disney.
""We had an idea and we were developing it for a while, ages ago, to have more of a female-led — not totally female-led, but just a different kind of story — which we thought would've been really cool, but I guess they don't want to do it,"" Robbie tells Vanity Fair in a new cover story.
A spokesperson for Disney did not immediately respond to EW's request for comment.
Screenwriter Christina Hodson, who worked on Birds of Prey, was set to write the new Pirates movie, EW had earlier confirmed. The idea wasn't to do a formal spin-off but rather a separate origin story with new characters. This would've been completely different than the long-in-development reboot of the franchise that was first reported back in 2019.
Orlando Bloom's Will Turner, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann, and Johnny Depp's (Captain!) Jack Sparrow were the central focus of the first three movies — 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean, 2006's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, and 2007's Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.
Depp returned with Geoffrey Rush's Hector Barbossa for 2011's Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, which added Penélope Cruz's Angelica and Ian McShane's Edward Teach. In 2017, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales reunited Bloom and Knightley while introducing even more new characters.
The future of the franchise is unclear at this point. During the defamation trial between Depp and ex-wife Amber Heard, Depp testified that Disney cut ties with him after Heard published her 2018 Washington Post op-ed in which she described herself as a victim of domestic abuse, though she didn't mention Depp by name.
Depp denies Heard's allegations of abuse. A jury sided with the actor in the defamation trial, determining that Heard intentionally and maliciously defamed him with the op-ed. Heard won a counterclaim that stated Depp defamed her through his lawyer by calling her abuse accusations a ""hoax"" in the press, insinuating that her friends had set up Depp.

**Pirates of the Caribbean: Resurrecting a Cancelled Script**

That's reason enough to crack open a bottle of rum. In an exclusive interview with Collider, producer Jerry Bruckheimer revealed that the cancelled female-led Pirates of the Caribbean script may still have a pulse. This news comes as a surprise, given that the project was officially axed last month.

The initial announcement of a female-led Pirates of the Caribbean movie came in 2020, with Margot Robbie set to star and Christina Hodson, writer of Birds of Prey, on board to pen the script. Bruckheimer was attached to produce, which would have connected the new film to the larger franchise. However, Robbie revealed that the project was dead in the water, stating, ""We had an idea, and we were developing it for a while, ages ago, to have more of a female-led—not totally female-led, but just a different kind of story—which we thought would’ve been really cool. But I guess they don't want to do it.""

The question remains, who are ""they"" that made the decision to scrap the project? The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has been a cash cow for Disney, making it all the more puzzling.

Currently, Bruckheimer is working on a different Pirates of the Caribbean movie, although details are scarce. Ted Elliott, who wrote the scripts for the first four Pirates films, is reportedly teaming up with Chernobyl creator Craig Mazin to write the sixth installment. However, little is known about the plot or whether it will feature legacy characters from the original trilogy.

The franchise, based on the beloved Disney theme park ride, began its successful run with 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. The movie's surprise success, hauling in over $650 million at the global box office, also earned Johnny Depp a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his iconic portrayal of Jack Sparrow. The last movie in the franchise, 2017's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, was a critical and commercial flop, ultimately leading to the franchise's hiatus. Robbie's female-led movie could have been the revitalizing force Disney needed to reignite the franchise's spark.

With no release date set for the Pirates of the Caribbean movie currently in development, fans can only hope that Bruckheimer's optimism will translate to a successful resurrection of the franchise.","Here is the rewritten document:

Jerry Bruckheimer, the mastermind behind the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, revealed in an exclusive interview with Collider's Perri Nemiroff that there's still a chance to revive the script of the cancelled female-led take on the beloved franchise. This news comes on the heels of the upcoming Disney+ National Treasure series.

As fans may recall, the female-led Pirates of the Caribbean was first announced in 2020 with Margot Robbie attached to lead the cast, and Birds of Prey scribe Christina Hodson set to write the script. Bruckheimer was also attached to produce, which would have tied the Robbie-centric sequel to the larger franchise. Sadly, the project sank earlier last month when Robbie revealed that it was never going to see the light of day. At the time, Robbie cryptically mentioned that ""they"" didn't want to pursue the project, leaving many to wonder who exactly was behind the cancellation, especially considering the franchise's immense profitability for Disney.

Currently, it appears that Bruckheimer is developing a different Pirates of the Caribbean movie, although details are scarce. Ted Elliott, who wrote the scripts for the first four Pirates films, is reportedly teaming up with Chernobyl creator Craig Mazin to write the sixth movie script. However, the plot and whether it will feature legacy characters from the original trilogy remain under wraps.

The franchise, which originated from the beloved Disney theme park ride, began its successful run with 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. The movie became a surprise hit, raking in over $650 million at the global box office. The film also earned Johnny Depp, who played the iconic pirate Jack Sparrow, a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. The last movie in the franchise, 2017's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, was a critical and commercial disappointment, ultimately leading to the franchise's hiatus. Robbie's female-led movie could have been the reboot the franchise needed to reignite its spark.

**Pirates of the Caribbean: A Franchise Adrift**

The rum may be flowing, but the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is still stuck in the doldrums. Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer behind all five previous swashbuckling adventures, has revealed that there's still a glimmer of hope for the cancelled female-led take on the franchise. In an exclusive chat with Collider's Perri Nemiroff, Bruckheimer hinted that the script might yet be resurrected.

The female-led Pirates of the Caribbean was first announced in 2020, with Margot Robbie set to take the helm and Christina Hodson, the scribe behind Birds of Prey, penning the script. Bruckheimer was also on board to produce, which would have connected the new film to the larger franchise. Alas, the project was officially scuttled last month, with Robbie revealing that ""we had an idea, and we were developing it for a while, ages ago, to have more of a female-led—not totally female-led, but just a different kind of story—which we thought would’ve been really cool. But I guess they don't want to do it.""

The question on everyone's lips is: who are ""they""? It's a mystery, especially considering the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has been a cash cow for Disney.

Sodium nitrate is an oxidizing agent often used to preserve food. TMZ reported that the actor acquired the substance online and quoted his mother, Monica Mindler, as saying her son had recently researched the compound on the internet as it pertains to painless suicide.
Matthew Mindler's untimely death has been ruled a suicide.
On Aug. 30, two days after the former child actor's remains were recovered near his Pennsylvania college campus, the Lancaster County Coroner's Office told NBC News he died by suicide. The exact cause of Mindler's passing is pending toxicology results, officials said.
Mindler was first reported missing by his family on Aug. 25 after he failed to attend class or return to his Millersville University dorm room after being spotted on security footage the night before. At approximately 8 p.m. on Aug. 24, the 19-year-old student was seen exiting his residence building carrying a backpack and wearing black pants and a Millersville University sweatshirt.
Millersville University President Daniel A. Wubah confirmed news of Miller's death in a letter addressed to staff and students and shared to social media.
Wubah indicated that Miller was found deceased in Manor Township, Penn., which is located approximately five miles from campus.
""This is a time of grief for the family, our campus and the community,"" the statement read. ""I ask that the campus community come together to support each other, and our students, during this difficult time.""
Mindler was thrust into the spotlight opposite Paul Rudd in the 2011 film Our Idiot Brother. The late star's other credited roles included As the World Turns, as well as short films and TV movies.

If you're unfamiliar ... sodium nitrate is an oxidizing agent -- one often used to preserve foods, like meat -- that causes hypotension and limits the flow of oxygen in the body, which can result in death.
While sodium nitrate deaths are often accidental, Matt's was anything but ... this according to his mom, Monica, who says she discovered a harrowing trail Matthew left behind.
Monica tells us she looked up Matt's recent Internet search histories, and it turns out ... he was looking up information on this lethal compound as it pertained to suicide, and ways to obtain it and take it for the ultimate effect of ending one's life painlessly.
We're told she had no clue this was something he'd been exploring prior to his body being found by school officials near his university in Pennsylvania -- but more importantly, she wants this to serve as a cautionary tale for others.
Monica hopes someone else's life can be saved if folks know what warning signs to look for ... as this is a fairly cheap product Matthew seems to have ordered on Amazon with relative ease, at just $15, which Monica says was enough to kill 4 people.

Matthew Mindler's untimely passing has been ruled a suicide, with the Lancaster County Coroner's report revealing that the former child star's death was caused by complications of sodium nitrate toxicity.

Sodium nitrate, a common food preservative, was obtained by Mindler online, according to TMZ. The outlet also reported that the 19-year-old had been researching the compound's use in painless suicide methods on the internet, as revealed by his mother, Monica Mindler.

The Lancaster County Coroner's Office had initially reported that Mindler's cause of death was pending toxicology results, but the latest report has confirmed the tragic circumstances surrounding his passing.

Mindler was first reported missing by his family on August 25, after he failed to attend class or return to his Millersville University dorm room. Security footage showed the young actor leaving his residence building at approximately 8 p.m. on August 24, carrying a backpack and wearing a Millersville University sweatshirt.

The university leader expressed his condolences, stating, ""This is a time of grief for the family, our campus, and the community. I ask that the campus community come together to support each other, and our students, during this difficult time.""

Mindler's rise to fame began with his role opposite Paul Rudd in the 2011 film Our Idiot Brother. He also appeared in TV shows and short films throughout his career. However, his mother revealed that he had not acted professionally in several years prior to his disappearance.

The late actor's mother has yet to comment publicly on his passing.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of TMZ:

MATTHEW MINDLER'S DEATH BY SUICIDE CAUSED BY SODIUM NITRATE TOXICITY

We've gotten our hands on the Lancaster County Coroner's report, and it's been confirmed that Matthew Mindler's death was caused by complications of sodium nitrate toxicity.

For those who might not know, sodium nitrate is an oxidizing agent used to preserve food - but it's also deadly when ingested. And sources close to the investigation tell TMZ that Matthew acquired the substance online.

His mom, Monica Mindler, revealed to us that Matthew had been researching the compound on the internet, specifically looking up ways to obtain it and take it to end his life painlessly.

Tragically, Matthew was found dead near his Pennsylvania college campus on August 30, and the Lancaster County Coroner's Office confirmed it was a suicide.

The 19-year-old former child star was last seen on security footage leaving his dorm room carrying a backpack and wearing a Millersville University sweatshirt. His family reported him missing when he failed to attend class or return to his room.

Matthew's credits include the 2011 film ""Our Idiot Brother"" opposite Paul Rudd, as well as other TV movies and short films. But what's most important now is that his mom wants to raise awareness about the dangers of sodium nitrate.

“I can confirm all is well so this was done in error,” says a representative for Rhino, which is involved with Mitchell in an ongoing reissue series of her catalog material.
The faux report went out from People magazine, with tell-tale signs of a “pre-write” obituary that was published accidentally — every major news organization’s worst nightmare. “Joni Mitchell Dies at TK AGE,” read the headline that was seen on the magazine’s website as well as in a tweet, the “TK” meaning “to come” in journalistic parlance. The story itself also included editorial notes indicating details that needed to be filled in.
Although the article was soon pulled from the web, it did lead to speculation among fans that perhaps Mitchell really had passed and that People had just pulled the story to get further details before re-publishing its scoop. But there was no basis for the fleeting wave of panic, the rep says, other than a finger likely hitting the wrong button.
Mitchell has actually become more robust in her public appearances recently, after having stayed mostly out of the public eye since suffering a brain aneurysm rupture in 2015. She has since learned how to walk again and been a regular party host at her central California home, where “Joni jams” are a frequent, private occasion. In April, she walked the red carpet and spoke with a line of reporters before being honored at the annual MusiCares Person of the Year dinner, where she capped off the all-star tribute by contributing a few vocal lines to the jam. She sang and performed much more extensively in July at a Brandi Carlile-led “Joni jam” at the Newport Folk Festival, not only singing lead vocals on several songs but even showing off her renewed instrumental prowess on a guitar instrumental.
Although she is not expected to follow up on her return to singing live by coming out of recording retirement, Mitchell has been actively involved in the reissue series from Rhino Records, including a boxed set of her Asylum years material that just came out.

In a statement posted on her website at the time, she said, ""Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives.

UPDATE: Joni Mitchell Alive and Well, Contrary to Erroneous Report

Reports circulating online Friday morning claiming the death of legendary singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell were greatly exaggerated. A representative for Rhino, the label behind Mitchell's ongoing reissue series, has confirmed that the 78-year-old music icon is ""alive and well.""

The false report, which was briefly published by People magazine, bore all the hallmarks of a premature obituary. The headline, ""Joni Mitchell Dies at TK AGE,"" featured the journalistic placeholder ""TK"" (short for ""to come""), while the article itself contained editorial notes indicating gaps in the reporting.

Although the offending article was swiftly pulled from the web, it sparked a flurry of speculation among fans, with some theorizing that Mitchell had indeed passed away and that People was simply waiting for further details before re-publishing the story. However, a representative for Rhino has assured us that the error was simply a result of a misplaced click.

In reality, Mitchell has been making a gradual return to the public eye, following a period of relative seclusion after suffering a brain aneurysm rupture in 2015. The singer has been learning to walk again and has hosted a series of intimate ""Joni jams"" at her central California home. In April, she made a triumphant appearance on the red carpet, where she was honored at the MusiCares Person of the Year dinner. More recently, Mitchell took the stage at the Newport Folk Festival, delivering a series of rousing performances alongside Brandi Carlile.

While there are no plans for Mitchell to release new material, the singer remains actively involved in Rhino's ongoing reissue series, which has already yielded a critically acclaimed boxed set of her Asylum years material.

Joni Mitchell Is Alive and Well, Despite False Death Report

Don't believe the rumors, folks! Joni Mitchell is very much alive and kicking, despite a false report that circulated online claiming the legendary singer-songwriter had passed away.

On Friday, a news report surfaced claiming Mitchell had died, but a rep for Rhino Records, which is involved in an ongoing reissue series of her music catalog, confirmed that the report was entirely false. ""I can confirm all is well, so this was done in error,"" the rep said in a statement.

It appears that the report was a pre-written obituary that was accidentally published by People magazine, complete with a ""TK"" (to come) in the headline, indicating that details still needed to be filled in. The mistake was quickly rectified, but not before sparking a wave of panic among Mitchell's fans.

Rest assured, the 78-year-old music icon is doing just fine, and has even been making more public appearances lately after a few years of keeping a low profile. In fact, she was spotted walking the red carpet and chatting with reporters at the annual MusiCares Person of the Year dinner in April, where she was honored for her contributions to music.

Mitchell has also been busy working on her reissue series with Rhino Records, including a recent boxed set of her Asylum years material. And while she may not be planning to return to the recording studio anytime soon, fans can take comfort in knowing that she's still going strong.

In April, she made a triumphant return to the red carpet, speaking with reporters and being honored at the annual MusiCares Person of the Year dinner, where she even contributed a few vocal lines to the all-star tribute. Her performance at the Newport Folk Festival in July was particularly noteworthy, with Mitchell singing lead vocals on several songs and showcasing her renewed instrumental prowess on guitar.

While Mitchell is not expected to follow up her return to singing live with a new recording, she has been actively involved in Rhino Records' reissue series of her catalog material, including a recently released boxed set of her Asylum years material.

0.75,"The end of Daredevil season 2 brought with it a mix of emotions that characterized the new episodes as a whole. There were triumphs and moments of desperation, highs and Foggy-centric scenes. Overall, the season felt like an improvement over the first, but there’s still room to grow. And if anything is clear from the finale, the show has every intention of taking another swing on the billy clubs.
I also mean that in a literal sense because Matt received his signature baton from Melvin. Finally complete, Daredevil really does work on screen, but making viewers sit through 13 hours before they see the costume and another 13 before he gets his trademark weapon feels like the same philosophy behind downloadable content for video games? Why give the audience the full package up front? Let’s make them pay for it!
But now that we have Daredevil: Game of the Year Edition, the rest of the episode was satisfying. Netflix even threw in a fully costumed Elektra and Punisher as bonuses. Seeing all three of these heroes on screen in this state feels like a show I could have been more enthusiastic about throughout and less like a proper reward for marching through scenes of Karen happening into a journalism job and talking to her editor.
With a climactic stage all set and the players finally in their correct outfits, Daredevil delivered an hour big on action and laced with a few emotional moments.
Matt, having escaped The Hand with both Stick and Elektra intact, is having some trouble believing that his former girlfriend could possibly be the ultimate weapon, and it’s hard to blame him. There’s very little information given about the specifics of Elektra’s status as the Black Sky, what that means, and what The Hand actually wants with her. It’s actually unclear for much of the episode whether the ninjas want to kill her or just kidnap her. Stick suggests that they’ll murder Elektra as soon as they can, but Nobu does seem upset when she sacrifices herself.

Oh, yeah, Elektra died. Did anyone expect her to make it through? But even as inevitable as it all seemed, her final moments with her beloved Matthew were some of the most affecting of the season, up there with Castle’s cemetery speech. The end of that story line also tied up the central struggle of whether Matt is more Daredevil or more neighborhood lawyer, as if he wasn’t favoring the former during the entire season.
There was a lot to like in the new Daredevil episodes, which succeeded by adding more of the superhero elements and pulling back on Foggy’s and Karen’s roles. Considering the state of the law firm by the end of the season, the writers may be ready to get rid of the more pedestrian story lines all together, which could help the series overall.","Matt Murdock makes bad decisions. He wants to do good, of course, and recognizes the many flaws of our justice system that allow bad people to slip through the cracks. His faith and his powers compel him to act, to go outside of the law to ensure those people can’t exploit the loopholes that let them run free in the first place. However, his guilty conscience makes it hard for him to feel good about vigilantism. And because of that guilt, Matt Murdock is a man who does not like himself. That’s why he so often leaps headfirst into bad ideas, like the blind man he is.
Daredevil’s second season is at its best when Matt undermines every good thing in his life. It’s been a slow, subtle process, and as we reach the season finale, “A Cold Day in Hell’s Kitchen,” he’s convinced himself that his life as Daredevil needs to be kept separate from those close to him. It’s been impossible to watch without thinking, “Matt, noooo!” whenever he did something dumb like, say, run off on another mission with Elektra, or refuse to tell Foggy anything.
Daredevil is about an imperfect hero, a man whose imperfections become more pronounced as his influence on the world grows. That’s good stuff. But the way this season has chosen to challenge his character ultimately underwhelms — the Punisher, intended to be a huge ideological foil, ends up shooting some Hand ninjas dead from afar to help Daredevil in his climactic fight with Nobu. In that same fight, Elektra — whose soul Matt’s been trying to save — straight-up kills a bunch of ninjas with impunity.
Vulture’s weekly newsletter of the best TV and movie recommendations.
Daredevil himself throws Nobu off a rooftop with the intention of killing him. So, was it all for naught? Is killing okay if a person really, really deserves it? I don’t know. Daredevil sure as hell gave up asking that question. All that’s left, then, is the Hand and their Black Sky.
With Nobu dead, the Hand retreats in defeat. Stick and Matt bury Elektra, the law firm of Nelson and Murdock is no more, and Karen Page is now a journalist charged with writing an editorial about her experiences. (As far as writing goes, it is very bad. The less we talk about it, the better.) Frank Castle is now the Punisher — and since his given name belongs to a man that the world believes to be dead, he also sets fire to the Castle home. (But not before he retrieves a mysterious CD labeled MICRO.) Without the burden of his identity, will Punisher continue to dish out his severe brand of justice, ostensibly with lots of sick puns?
Duh, yes, of course. He’s still not tired of the whole “killing bad guys” thing. He’ll never be tired of the whole “killing bad guys” thing. We know this because he’s carrying a huge freaking minigun.
Finally, Matt asks Karen to meet with him one last time. With his mask in hand, he’s decided to reveal what he’s been hiding from her all along: He’s Daredevil.
Foggy’s new job. Remember that law firm that wanted to meet with Foggy? It’s Jeri Hogarth’s firm from Jessica Jones! It looks like he’s going to take the job, too! Carrie-Anne Moss will be his boss!
Finally, Daredevil’s outfit is complete. For a while, I worried that we would never get to see Daredevil’s actual, honest-to-God billy club. You know, the one that works as a grappling hook and nunchaku and as a stick for hitting people. Maybe the producers felt it was too comic-book-y for the show’s grounded tone. Nope! Melvin gives it to Daredevil in this episode, after getting Elektra fitted for her own supersuit (which is okay, but not terribly distinct from the street clothes she already wore). It’s not used a whole lot, but it sure is cool.
A note on Karen Page. A commenter on my recap for “The Dark at the End of the Tunnel” raised a solid counterpoint about Karen’s sympathy for the Punisher: She killed Wesley at the end of the first season. This actually makes a lot of sense — it would mean Karen wants to believe that a person can kill a criminal and still be good, which I buy — but it’s curious that the show almost behaves as if Wesley’s death didn’t happen at all. The closest it comes to acknowledging what Karen did is when Frank comments on her handgun choice in “.380.” I’m not saying I wanted to see some ham-fisted scene where Karen lamented how she couldn’t live with herself, but a subtle mention would’ve been nice. The writers seemed to be aiming for subtext, but just ended up burying this important character beat.
And that’s a wrap. If you’ve been following along, you know I’ve been frustrated by Daredevil’s second season. The Hand simply wasn’t handled well; they just show up, overtaking the plot and causing Daredevil to abandon the thematic struggle it was trying to portray (while also terribly undercutting Elektra’s character). This is a damn shame, because ninjas are awesome. As a whole, the season has been an interesting, somewhat nonsensical ride, punctuated by great moments like the surprise return of Wilson Fisk. Here’s hoping that Daredevil, should it return, comes back with a renewed focus on character drama, tending more toward the psychological leanings of season one and less on the silly action of season two.
Oh, wait, what about that giant hole in the ground? Seriously. Is anyone going to tell us what that was all about? I don’t want to wait until season three or The Defenders or Captain America: Civil War to understand that nonsense.

The season 2 finale of Daredevil concluded with a narrative cocktail of highs and lows, echoing the overall tone of the latest episodes. Triumphs and desperation entwined, punctuated by Foggy-centric scenes that added depth to the narrative. While the season surpassed its predecessor, there is still room for growth. The finale's conclusion, however, left no doubt that the show is poised to take another bold swing.

In a literal sense, Matt Murdock finally received his iconic baton from Melvin, completing his transformation into the iconic superhero. It is noteworthy that the show reserved this reveal for the finale, mirroring the philosophy behind video game downloadable content. This approach raises questions about the value proposition offered to viewers.

Beyond this intriguing plot twist, the episode delivered a satisfying conclusion. Netflix's bonus inclusions - a fully costumed Elektra and Punisher - added a new dimension to the narrative. Witnessing these heroes converge in their iconic attire finally delivered the show's promise, making the journey worthwhile.

The climactic finale boasted high-octane action and emotional resonance. Matt, having narrowly escaped The Hand alongside Stick and Elektra, struggled to reconcile his former girlfriend's status as the Black Sky. The specifics of her designation and The Hand's motivations remained shrouded in mystery, heightening the sense of uncertainty.

Stick's ominous warning of Elektra's impending doom was somewhat contradicted by Nobu's visible distress when she ultimately sacrificed herself. The emotional weight of her final moments with Matt was palpable, ranking among the season's most poignant scenes.

In retrospect, Elektra's demise was inevitable, yet its impact still resonated. The conclusion of this storyline also resolved the central conflict, as Matt finally embraced his dual identity as Daredevil and neighborhood lawyer.

The new Daredevil episodes succeeded by amplifying the superhero elements while scaling back Foggy's and Karen's roles. The writers may be poised to dispense with the more mundane storylines, allowing the series to flourish.

Daredevil Season 2 Finale: A Satisfying, If Imperfect, Conclusion

It's been four months since the curtain closed on Daredevil season 2, and we're still reeling from the emotional highs and lows of those 13 hours. The finale, in particular, was a mixed bag, oscillating between moments of triumph and desperation. Overall, the season was an improvement over its predecessor, but there's still room for growth. And if one thing is clear, it's that the show is gearing up for another adrenaline-fueled swing of the billy clubs.

Take, for instance, the long-overdue debut of Matt Murdock's signature baton, courtesy of Melvin. It's about time we got to see Daredevil in all his glory! But why make us wait 13 hours for the costume reveal and another 13 for the iconic weapon? It's like the Marvel gods are playing a cruel game of withholding, à la downloadable content for video games. Give us the full package upfront, folks!

Luckily, the finale delivered on its promise, aided by a climactic showdown and some welcome guest appearances. Seeing Elektra and Punisher in their respective getups was a treat, even if it felt like a consolation prize for sitting through the earlier, more meandering plotlines. Karen's journalism escapades, anyone? No, didn't think so.

As we hurtled toward the season's climax, Matt was struggling to come to terms with Elektra's role as the Black Sky. What does it even mean? The Hand's motivations were murky at best, leaving us wondering if they wanted to kidnap or kill her (Nobu's emotional response seemed to suggest the latter, but who knows?). Stick, on the other hand, was adamant that they'd stop at nothing to take her out.

Oh, right, Elektra died. Was anyone truly surprised? Despite the inevitability of it all, her final moments with Matt were some of the most affecting of the season, rivaling Castle's cemetery speech for emotional resonance. As the dust settled, it became clear that this was a tale of Daredevil's dual identities, with Matt finally embracing his superhero persona over his neighborhood lawyer alter ego.

There were some clear winners in the new season, namely the increased focus on superhero elements and the reduced screen time for Foggy and Karen. Maybe it's time to axe those pedestrian plotlines altogether? The writers might be onto something there.

Overall, while season 2 had its flaws, there was plenty to love. Bring on the next swing of those billy clubs – we're ready for it.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Vulture:

The curtain call of Daredevil's sophomore season was a mixed bag, a jumble of emotions that encapsulated the new episodes as a whole. There were moments of triumph, desperation, and Foggy-centric scenes that left us breathless. Overall, the season felt like a marked improvement over its predecessor, but there's still room for growth. And if the finale taught us anything, it's that the show is hell-bent on taking another swing at the billy clubs.

I mean that quite literally, too, since Matt finally got his signature baton from Melvin. It's a moment that's been a long time coming, and it's a testament to the show's commitment to its source material. But let's be real, making viewers wait 13 hours for the costume and another 13 for the trademark weapon feels like a cynical ploy to stretch out the narrative. Why not give the audience the full package upfront? It's a philosophy that reeks of downloadable content for video games.

But now that we have Daredevil: Game of the Year Edition, the rest of the episode was a satisfying payoff. Netflix even threw in a fully costumed Elektra and Punisher as bonuses. Seeing all three of these heroes on screen in their element feels like a show I could have been more enthusiastic about throughout, rather than a reward for slogging through scenes of Karen's journalism job and her editor.

The climactic final hour was big on action and laced with emotional moments that tugged at the heartstrings. Matt, having escaped The Hand with both Stick and Elektra intact, is struggling to come to terms with his former girlfriend's status as the ultimate weapon. And who can blame him? There's precious little information given about the specifics of Elektra's status as the Black Sky, what that means, and what The Hand actually wants with her.

0.4324324324324324,"George R.R. Martin gives us another wedding to remember on the latest episode of House of the Dragon.
We've heard tell of the ""Bronze Bitch,"" the pet name Daemon (Matt Smith) has given his wife. This week's episode offers a proper introduction for Rhea Royce (Rachel Redford), who is as wary of her husband as he is of her. The two meet in a stony valley in the Vale, Daemon hooded and looking as hungover as he was at the end of last week's episode. Rhea taunts his loss of the Iron Throne to ""a little girl,"" but soon recognizes something sinister in his eyes. She reaches for her bow as her horse rears, giving Daemon the opportunity to push it off balance and send her toppling. Neck presumably broken, she taunts him one last time — ""I knew you couldn't finish"" — before he scoops up a rock that's just the right size for skull crushing.
Viserys (Paddy Considine), meanwhile, sails to Driftmark with Princess Rhaenyra (Milly Alcock) and his new Hand, Lyonel Strong (Gavin Spokes), who has replaced Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans). Viserys plans to propose a marriage between Rhaenyra and Laenor Velaryon (Theo Nate), son of Corlys (Steve Toussaint) and Princess Rhaenys (Eve Best). He's pale and sick upon arrival, not to mention spurned by Corlys' refusal to meet him at the gate.
Still, Corlys is receptive to the marriage, though he has questions about succession. He'd like Rhaenyra and Laenor's children to bear their father's name, as is tradition. His obvious desire is for a Velaryon to sit on the Iron Throne, but Viserys won't go that far. He'll allow the children to bear the Velaryon name at birth, but any heir that ascends the Iron Throne will do so as a Targaryen. ""Dragons will rule the kingdom for the next 100 years, just as they did the last,"" says Viserys, the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy humming in his mind.
Corlys accepts. Privately, he's thrilled, but Rhaenys has reservations. ""We are placing our son in danger,"" she says, warning that ""knives will come out"" once Rhaenyra becomes queen. She knows better than anyone how the realm feels about a female ruler.
There's also the matter of Laenor's ""true nature."" It's an open secret that Laenor prefers the company of men (even Corlys knows, though he hopes his son will ""outgrow"" it). Rhaenyra also knows and makes a proposition to her future husband: They'll get hitched, make a few babies, and then indulge their other appetites. That's fine with Laenor, who's been secretly romancing a ginger knight with the unfortunate name of Joffrey (Solly McLeod).
Rhaenyra spends the trip back to King's Landing with her own secret lover, Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel), who isn't as comfortable with being a secret as Joffrey is. He proposes that they leave Westeros for Essos, where they can be married and live a life free from politics. It's a sweet, naive proposition, one that Rhaenyra can't take seriously. She's in too deep at this point, and there's also the Song of Ice and Fire to think about. She assures Criston of her and Laenor's ""understanding,"" but the arrangement makes him feel like a ""whore."" He's a man of duty and obedience, and he's tearing himself up over breaking his celibacy oath. Marrying her is the only way he can restore his integrity.
Back at King's Landing, Alicent (Emily Carey) meets with her father as he leaves the castle in shame. He blames her for his dismissal, saying she chose to side with Rhaenyra. Alicent defends her friend: ""She swore her innocence and I believe her."" But Otto's concern isn't for Rhaenyra's innocence so much as her claim on the Throne. ""The realm will not accept her,"" he spits, saying she'll put Alicent's children ""to the sword"" in order to stay in power. ""Either you prepare Aegon to rule or you cleave to Rhaenyra and pray for her mercy.""
Otto isn't the only one whispering in Alicent's ear. Larys Strong (Matthew Needham), the limping, Littlefinger-esque son of Lyonel, returns after a brief appearance in episode 3 to tell the queen about the curious cup of medicinal tea Rhaenyra was served the night Otto was dismissed. He knows that Alicent knows the purpose of such a cup, and this revelation causes her to doubt Rhaenyra's claim to innocence.
She summons Criston once Viserys and Rhaenyra return to King's Landing. There's been rumors of a ""lapse of morals,"" she explains, and Criston starts to spill his guts. This catches Alicent entirely off-guard, as the possibility that Rhaenyra slept with anyone besides Daemon hadn't even crossed her mind. ""My oath has been broken, I have dishonored myself, I deserve no consideration,"" Criston says. Alicent is struck, not by Criston's betrayal but by Rhaenyra's deception. Alicent sold out her father because she wanted to believe her best friend wasn't lying to her. She dismisses Criston with no punishment.
As the kingdom prepares for a welcoming feast ahead of Rhaenyra and Laenor's wedding, Viserys seeks treatment for the various ailments afflicting him. The king's been in various states of medical distress since the series began, and here he looks on the verge of death. As he endures another leech bath, he ponders his legacy with Lyonel. ""Hardly makes a good song,"" he mutters while reflecting on his relatively unremarkable reign. ""Is it not better to live in peace than to have songs sung after you've died?"" Lyonel asks. It's a good question, but an unromantic one.
Guests at the welcoming feast include the blustering Jason Lannister (Jefferson Hall), Gerald Royce (cousin of Rhea), and Daemon. When Alicent arrives in the middle of Viserys' greeting, her resplendent green dress draws eyes from every corner of the room. As Larys explains, green is the color Hightowers fly when they're going to war. Viserys wraps up his speech by proclaiming Rhaenyra and Laenor's union will herald ""a second age of dragons in Westeros."" Alicent's chilly demeanor is evident.
Rhaenyra and Laenor entertain with a choreographed dance as the masses mingle. Alicent's uncle commends her leadership, saying that Oldtown, the seat of House Hightower, stands behind her. Gerald, meanwhile, confronts Daemon about Rhea's death. He believes Daemon had something to do with it. Daemon, who doesn't care enough to make a case for his innocence, casually declares that he plans to collect his inheritance. All that was Rhea's, including all of Runestone, will now be his. He leaves Gerald dumbstruck to go dance with Laena Velaryon (Savannah Steyn), who he quickly charms.
As Laena swoons over Daemon, Laenor and Joffrey sense the uneasy energy emanating from Criston. It's clear to Joffrey that Criston longs for Rhaenyra. He approaches Criston, acknowledging their individual places in the lives of Laenor and Rhaenyra. ""We should swear to each other to guard them and their secrets,"" he whispers, much to Criston's discontent.
Daemon, having moved on from Laena, finds himself dancing with Rhaenyra. Their violent, lustful chemistry instantly manifests. ""He will bore you senseless,"" he says of Laenor. She sneers playfully, taunting him with the challenge of cutting through her father's kingsguard in order to take her by force back to Dragonstone.
A fight erupts. It's not Daemon taking Rhaenyra by force, but rather Criston beating Joffrey's face into a bloody pulp. He is a man of honor, after all; deception is not something he takes lightly. He kills Joffrey, exits the castle, unsheathes his dagger, and prepares to end his life. It's Alicent who stops him. He can be of use to her.
Inside the castle, as a rat slurps up Joffrey's blood, Rhaenyra and Laenor are married. Just moments after the union is sealed with an uneasy kiss, Viserys topples to the ground.
It wouldn't be a Westerosi wedding without a bloodbath.
Subscribe to EW's West of Westeros podcast, which goes behind the making of House of the Dragon and the growing Game of Thrones universe.","Nuptials are deadly in Westeros. A bite of roasted pig, a glass of sloshing wine, a plate of sweet treats … and usually a pool of guts on the floor. The feast to open Rhaenyra’s wedding to Laenor Velaryon almost avoids this ending. There’s a string of near conflagrations between guests with inflamed tempers, but they all end without violence — until, in the episode’s final moments, the temptation to spill some blood grows too strong.
The fifth episode starts with one crushed-in, pulpy head and ends with another. Lady Rhea Royce, Daemon’s estranged wife and the unfortunate recipient of his classic brand of misogynistic cruelty (“Sheep are more fuckable than this woman,” etc.), appears content with her lot. One foggy morning, she heads out into the Vale’s craggy passes to hunt deer (we later hear she was an excellent sportswoman), only to be greeted by her hooded husband, alone in a ravine with a menacing look on his face. Rhea — actually extremely pretty and absolutely tired of this man’s depraved bullshit — must have had a hearty breakfast because she’s prepared to tear him a new one. Their marriage, we learn, is unconsummated, furthering the “Daemon can’t keep it up” theory. And when he knocks her from her horse, paralyzing her on the ground, she manages to get in one last rib: “I knew you couldn’t finish!” Until that is, he comes toward her, heavy rock in hand, looking to mangle the face he ridiculed all across the continent.
For House of the Dragon’s first four episodes, Daemon was the biggest threat to the stability of Viserys’s reign. And he’s still plotting away. But now a pack of new menaces has arrived just in time to broaden the show’s reach.
Vulture’s weekly newsletter of the best TV and movie recommendations.
His backbone is as flagging as his immune system. Dragging himself to Driftmark to ask for Laenor and Rhaenyra’s betrothal is beneath the dignity of a king. The lack of a welcoming party is another knock. But negotiations with Corlys and Rhaenys (who seems genuinely delighted to see her cousin and former rival) go smoother than expected, partly because Viserys partially relents to their demands. In a moment straight out of The Crown (complete with a castle that bears an uncanny resemblance to St. Michael’s Mount off the coast of Cornwall in England), Corlys asks that any children from the union carry the Velaryon family name, just as Prince Philip asks for Charles & Co. to carry the surname Mountbatten. Philip is denied — dropping the family name for the next monarch is akin to ending the dynasty — but Viserys makes an allowance for his grandchildren; they can use the Velaryon surname until the time leading up to the crowning of Rhaenyra’s successor. It sounds small fry, but that’s potentially a big win for Corlys. If Laenor’s and Rhaenyra’s (hypothetical) child comes of age as a Velaryon, it may be hard for the public ever to accept that they’re really a Targaryen. Perhaps Corlys (unlike almost everyone else at court) has his eye on the long game.
After a less-than-romantic start (“I hold nothing against you”), Laenor and Rhaenyra end up with a compromise of their own — one that personally made me weep for that poor little lad and lass. “How about we just … tolerate one another?” was the gist. They’ll have just enough sex to produce an heir and maybe a spare; otherwise, let each other satiate their “appetites” separately. (This is Duck, Duck, Goose as I’ve never seen it.) “We perform our duties to our fathers and to the realm, and when it’s done, each of us dines as we see fit,” Rhaenyra proposes. This is all very grown up and reasonable, but as the frame of a marriage, woooo boy, what a bummer. Luckily (?) they grew up together and get along well — Rhaenys notes their, dear God, “familiarity” — but this is really no basis for a system of government!
House of the Dragon is still learning how to pace itself. When Cristan asks Rhaenyra to run away with him to Essos, he proclaims that he’s been listening to her fantasize about leaving “for years” — but we hardly know him, so their intimacy doesn’t fully translate. In the span of one episode, Rhaenyra and Laenor are engaged, try to work out new coital arrangements with their other partners, and start their wedding feast. The progression from tentative chats on the beaches of Driftmark to formal dancing in the Great Hall is so quick that some of the weight falls out. Had the writers spun things out a bit and let the tension build between Laenor’s boyfriend (the unfortunately named Joffrey Lonmouth) and Cristan, then the vicious face-hammering Lonmouth gets might have stung the audience and not just Laenor.
With that said, the shock of the scene came from two directions. First, a number of opportunities for trouble arose and then snuffed themselves out before the mid-banquet tussle. There was Daemon, swooping into the Hall with his new ’do: just an uncle come to offer a parting kiss to the niece he tried to fuck against a wall a while back. Gerold Royce, uncle to Rhea and a regular Columbo, strolls in and is given the unlikely chance to tell Daemon that they’re onto him for her murder, the sort of accusation that could easily lead to some drawn swords. And then there is Alicent, essentially staging a coup by couture. Earlier in the episode, after she learned from Larys Strong that Rhaenyra did, in fact, give up her virginity and gulp down a special Plan B tea brewed by the Grand Maester, Alicent’s allegiance slowly shifted via color. Kissing her father good-bye, she wore the Targaryen red and gold. While watching Viserys stumble out of the carriage, she donned blue. But strolling into the wedding party, just late enough to ensure all eyes are on her, she wears emerald green, the color of the torch fire lit to call bannermen to arms in her home city of Oldtown. Fellow Hightowers quietly cheer her signal, but no battle breaks out.
Secondly, the fight itself is staged more like real life than your typical TV fight. (I was surprised that Miguel Sapochnik, with his brilliance for filming hand-to-hand combat, didn’t direct this episode.) Limbs flail, bodies are tossed aside, and no one, including viewers, has a sense of what is happening. It looks at first like Daemon, while roughly luring Rhaenyra from the room and her forthcoming marriage, has incurred Cristan’s wrath. Then the spill of dirty blond curls appears to come from Jason Lannister’s smarmy little head. Ironically, it isn’t until Cristan flips over the body, its face puckered in like a rotten bit of fruit, that Joffrey’s features are clear. Blood pools around him around the stone floor. Anyone reasonable would infer that the wedding might be delayed or deferred after this opening ceremony.
But hours later, Rhaenyra’s hair still tousled, the septon unites her in marriage with Laenor, who is certainly in a state of shock. Why rush? And why, oh why, hold the wedding in the same hall where Lonmouth’s flesh still stains the floor?
Breaking his vows proves too much for Cristan. While his beloved Rhaenyra weds Laenor, he retreats to the weirwood tree, dagger in hand, ready to open his own belly. But Alicent, who spared his life and has so far kept his secret, appears. Rhaenyra has a new ally in the Velaryons, but betrayal may bind Alicent and Cristan in ways no one can foresee.
• When Otto leaves King’s Landing, he spells out a vital message for Alicent, who is too simple for her own good. Viserys won’t live into old age, and the kingdom will not want Rhaenyra as queen. She’ll have to kill her rivals to assert her claim, meaning little Aegon Targaryen and his baby sibling are headed for the chopping block. Alicent doesn’t appear a particularly doting mother, but it’s this warning, plus the revelation that Rhaenyra lied to her, that finally turns Alicent from a simpering fool to a motivated woman.
• Rhaenys’s outfit in this episode is the epitome of pirate chic: miniskirt, high boots, drapey-armed blouse. It’s refreshing to see a short hemline in Westeros.
• Never trust a man who seeks you out alone in a weirwood, unnecessarily flatters your father, and then, whoops, spills the beans about your best friend’s secret prophylactic use. Larys Strong (called Larys Clubfoot in Fire & Blood) is most likely not as docile as he presents himself to Alicent. But he might prove an interesting ally for her.
• If the punishment for sleeping with a virgin princess were either gelding or death, I, too, would take death. Alicent lets Cristan off easy, but we have to wonder why.

112.  House of the Dragon dishes out another unforgettable wedding, courtesy of George R.R. Martin.

We're formally introduced to Rhea Royce (Rachel Redford), Daemon's (Matt Smith) wife, who's as wary of him as he is of her. Their meeting unfolds in a stony valley in the Vale, with Daemon donning a hood and sporting a hangover from last week's episode. Rhea goads him about losing the Iron Throne to ""a little girl,"" but soon senses something ominous in his eyes. As she reaches for her bow, her horse rears up, giving Daemon the chance to push it off balance and send her crashing down. Presumably, her neck is broken as she taunts him one last time—""I knew you couldn't finish""—before he picks up a rock of the perfect size for skull crushing.

Meanwhile, Viserys (Paddy Considine) sets sail for Driftmark with Princess Rhaenyra (Milly Alcock) and his new Hand, Lyonel Strong (Gavin Spokes), who's replaced Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans). Viserys plans to propose a marriage between Rhaenyra and Laenor Velaryon (Theo Nate), son of Corlys (Steve Toussaint) and Princess Rhaenys (Eve Best). Viserys appears pale and ill upon arrival, having been snubbed by Corlys' refusal to meet him at the gate.

Despite this, Corlys is open to the marriage, albeit with questions about succession. He'd like Rhaenyra and Laenor's children to bear their father's name, as is tradition. His obvious desire is for a Velaryon to occupy the Iron Throne, but Viserys won't go that far. He'll allow the children to bear the Velaryon name at birth, but any heir who ascends the Iron Throne will do so as a Targaryen. ""Dragons will rule the kingdom for the next 100 years, just as they did the last,"" Viserys says, the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy resonating in his mind.

Corlys accepts. Privately, he's thrilled, but Rhaenys harbors reservations. ""We are placing our son in danger,"" she warns, cautioning that ""knives will come out"" once Rhaenyra becomes queen. She's all too aware of the realm's unease with a female ruler.

There's also the matter of Laenor's ""true nature."" It's an open secret that Laenor has a preference for men (even Corlys knows, though he hopes his son will ""outgrow"" it). Rhaenyra is also aware and proposes a deal to her future husband: They'll get hitched, produce a few babies, and then indulge their other desires. This arrangement suits Laenor, who's been secretly romancing a ginger knight named Joffrey (Solly McLeod).

Rhaenyra spends the trip back to King's Landing with her own secret lover, Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel), who's less comfortable with being a secret than Joffrey is. He suggests they leave Westeros for Essos, where they can marry and live a life free from politics. It's a sweet, naive proposal that Rhaenyra can't take seriously. She's in too deep at this point, and there's also the Song of Ice and Fire to consider. She assures Criston of her and Laenor's ""understanding,"" but the arrangement makes him feel like a ""whore."" He's a man of duty and obedience, and he's torn himself apart over breaking his celibacy oath. Marrying her is the only way he can restore his integrity.

Back in King's Landing, Alicent (Emily Carey) meets with her father as he leaves the castle in shame. He blames her for his dismissal, claiming she chose to side with Rhaenyra. Alicent defends her friend, saying, ""She swore her innocence, and I believe her."" But Otto's concern isn't for Rhaenyra's innocence so much as her claim on the Throne. ""The realm will not accept her,"" he spits, warning that she'll put Alicent's children ""to the sword"" to stay in power. ""Either you prepare Aegon to rule or you cleave to Rhaenyra and pray for her mercy.""

Otto isn't the only one whispering in Alicent's ear. Larys Strong (Matthew Needham), the limping, Littlefinger-esque son of Lyonel, returns after a brief appearance in episode 3 to tell the queen about the curious cup of medicinal tea Rhaenyra was served the night Otto was dismissed. He knows Alicent is aware of the purpose of such a cup, and this revelation causes her to doubt Rhaenyra's claim to innocence.

She summons Criston once Viserys and Rhaenyra return to King's Landing. There's been rumors of a ""lapse of morals,"" she explains, and Criston starts to spill his guts. This catches Alicent entirely off guard, as the possibility that Rhaenyra slept with anyone besides Daemon hadn't even crossed her mind. ""My oath has been broken, I have dishonored myself, I deserve no consideration,"" Criston says. Alicent is struck, not by Criston's betrayal but by Rhaenyra's deception. Alicent sold out her father because she wanted to believe her best friend wasn't lying to her. She dismisses Criston with no punishment.

As the kingdom prepares for a welcoming feast ahead of Rhaenyra and Laenor's wedding, Viserys seeks treatment for the various ailments afflicting him. The king's been in various states of medical distress since the series began, and here he looks on the verge of death. As he endures another leech bath, he ponders his legacy with Lyonel. ""Hardly makes a good song,"" he mutters while reflecting on his relatively unremarkable reign. ""Is it not better to live in peace than to have songs sung after you've died?"" Lyonel asks. It's a good question, but an unromantic one.

Guests at the welcoming feast include the blustering Jason Lannister (Jefferson Hall), Gerald Royce (cousin of Rhea), and Daemon. When Alicent arrives in the middle of Viserys' greeting, her resplendent green dress draws eyes from every corner of the room. As Larys explains, green is the color Hightowers fly when they're going to war. Viserys wraps up his speech by proclaiming Rhaenyra and Laenor's union will herald ""a second age of dragons in Westeros."" Alicent's chilly demeanor is evident.

Rhaenyra and Laenor entertain with a choreographed dance as the masses mingle. Alicent's uncle commends her leadership, saying that Oldtown, the seat of House Hightower, stands behind her. Gerald, meanwhile, confronts Daemon about Rhea's death. He believes Daemon had something to do with it. Daemon, who doesn't care enough to make a case for his innocence, casually declares that he plans to collect his inheritance. All that was Rhea's, including all of Runestone, will now be his. He leaves Gerald dumbstruck to go dance with Laena Velaryon (Savannah Steyn), who he quickly charms.

As Laena swoons over Daemon, Laenor and Joffrey sense the uneasy energy emanating from Criston. It's clear to Joffrey that Criston longs for Rhaenyra. He approaches Criston, acknowledging their individual places in the lives of Laenor and Rhaenyra. ""We should swear to each other to guard them and their secrets,"" he whispers, much to Criston's discontent.

Daemon, having moved on from Laena, finds himself dancing with Rhaenyra. Their violent, lustful chemistry instantly manifests. ""He will bore you senseless,"" he says of Laenor. She sneers playfully, taunting him with the challenge of cutting through her father's kingsguard in order to take her by force back to Dragonstone.

A fight erupts. It's not Daemon taking Rhaenyra by force, but rather Criston beating Joffrey's face into a bloody pulp. He is a man of honor, after all; deception is not something he takes lightly. He kills Joffrey, exits the castle, unsheathes his dagger, and prepares to end his life. It's Alicent who stops him. He can be of use to her.

Inside the castle, as a rat slurps up Joffrey's blood, Rhaenyra and Laenor are married. Just moments after the union is sealed with an uneasy kiss, Viserys topples to the ground.

It wouldn't be a Westerosi wedding without a bloodbath.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Vulture:

The latest episode of House of the Dragon indulges in another brutal wedding, one that serves as a bloody reminder of the stakes in Westeros. George R.R. Martin's ""Bronze Bitch"" finally gets her introduction, only to meet a swift demise in a stony valley in the Vale. Daemon's hungover demeanor can't mask the sinister intentions in his eyes as Rhea taunts him about losing the Iron Throne to ""a little girl."" But before she can finish her jibe, Daemon sends her horse rearing and claims her fate with a well-placed rock.

Meanwhile, Viserys sets sail for Driftmark with Princess Rhaenyra and his new Hand, Lyonel Strong, in tow. The ailing king's plan to propose a marriage between Rhaenyra and Laenor Velaryon, Corlys' son, is met with skepticism by the Sea Snake. Corlys wants to ensure the children bear their father's name, a tradition that doesn't sit well with Viserys. The king insists that any heir who ascends the Iron Throne will do so as a Targaryen, following the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy. As the negotiations come to a close, Corlys accepts the proposal, but his wife, Rhaenys, harbors reservations.

Rhaenyra's own ""lapse of morals"" soon becomes the subject of gossip, thanks to Larys Strong's digging. The fate of Rhaenyra's secret lover, Ser Criston Cole, hangs in the balance as Alicent summons him to discuss the rumors. Criston's tortured conscience almost gets the better of him, but Alicent's calculated interest in his confession keeps him from spilling the beans.

The welcoming feast for Rhaenyra and Laenor's wedding brings the usual suspects together, including Daemon, who makes a stunning entrance with his elaborate outfit. As the guests mingle, Alicent's resplendent green dress, a color synonymous with war, draws attention from all corners of the room. Viserys's impassioned speech about a ""second age of dragons in Westeros"" receives a chilly reception from Alicent, whose demeanor screams ""I'm not impressed.""

As the episode hurtles toward its climax, Rhaenyra and Laenor's choreographed dance serves as a brief respite from the chaos. But the tension between Criston and Joffrey, Laenor's secret lover, comes to a head, ending in a brutal fight that leaves Joffrey's face battered. In the aftermath, Alicent intervenes to save Criston from taking his own life, revealing her intentions to use him for her own gain.

And just as we think the mayhem has subsided, Viserys collapses, setting the stage for what promises to be a thrilling second half of the season. After all, as we know, Westerosi weddings rarely end without bloodshed.

I also tried to mimic the sentence structure, vocabulary, and paragraph length of the reference documents to create a cohesive and engaging narrative.]","Here is the rewritten source document in the style of Vulture:

""House of the Dragon's latest episode is a bloody, lustful, and altogether unforgettable affair, with George R.R. Martin serving up yet another wedding to remember. This time, it's Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith) and his wife, Rhea Royce (Rachel Redford), who take center stage in a stony valley in the Vale. The tension between them is palpable, with Rhea taunting Daemon about his loss of the Iron Throne to ""a little girl."" But things take a dark turn when Daemon pushes her horse off balance, sending her tumbling to the ground. As she lies there, neck presumably broken, she can't resist one final jab at Daemon's expense - ""I knew you couldn't finish"" - before he silences her with a rock to the skull.

Meanwhile, Viserys (Paddy Considine) sets sail for Driftmark with Princess Rhaenyra (Milly Alcock) and his new Hand, Lyonel Strong (Gavin Spokes), who's replaced the ousted Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans). Viserys has a proposal in mind - a marriage between Rhaenyra and Laenor Velaryon (Theo Nate), son of Corlys (Steve Toussaint) and Princess Rhaenys (Eve Best). But Corlys has his own conditions, including a desire for Rhaenyra and Laenor's children to bear the Velaryon name. Viserys is willing to compromise, allowing the children to bear the Velaryon name at birth, but insisting that any heir who ascends the Iron Throne will do so as a Targaryen.

As the episode unfolds, we're treated to a series of intrigue-filled encounters, from Corlys' private reservations about the marriage to Rhaenys' warnings about the dangers of placing their son in the line of fire. And then there's the matter of Laenor's ""true nature,"" which is an open secret among the characters. Rhaenyra proposes a pragmatic solution - they'll marry, produce a few heirs, and then indulge their other appetites. Laenor is amenable to this arrangement, having already found a secret lover in the form of a ginger knight named Joffrey (Solly McLeod).

But Rhaenyra has her own secrets, including a clandestine affair with Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel). As they sail back to King's Landing, Criston proposes that they leave Westeros behind and start a new life in Essos, free from the machinations of the Seven Kingdoms. Rhaenyra is tempted, but ultimately unwilling to abandon her duty and her destiny.

Back in King's Landing, Alicent (Emily Carey) finds herself caught in the middle of a web of deceit and betrayal. Her father, Otto, blames her for his downfall, accusing her of choosing Rhaenyra over him. But Alicent stands by her friend, insisting that Rhaenyra swore her innocence and that she believes her. Otto's concerns, however, are more pragmatic - he fears that Rhaenyra will stop at nothing to claim the Iron Throne, even if it means putting Alicent's own children in harm's way.

As the episode hurtles towards its climax, we're treated to a series of dramatic confrontations, from Larys Strong's (Matthew Needham) whispered warnings to Alicent about Rhaenyra's supposed innocence to Criston's anguished confession about his own moral lapses. And then, of course, there's the wedding feast itself, which erupts into chaos when Criston attacks Joffrey in a fit of rage. It's a bloody, brutal sequence, one that leaves Joffrey dead and Criston on the brink of suicide.

In the end, it's Alicent who intervenes, staying Criston's hand and offering him a new purpose in life. As the episode draws to a close, we're left with a sense of unease and foreboding, a feeling that the fragile peace of the Seven Kingdoms is about to be shattered once again. After all, as we've learned time and time again in Westeros, a wedding is never just a wedding - it's a catalyst for bloodshed, betrayal, and chaos."""

The cover of Olivia Rodrigo's hit debut album SOUR was purple for a reason — the singer has ""baby synesthesia,"" and saw the color as she performed and listened to many of her songs.
The 19-year-old pop star shared that she has synesthesia, a neurological condition where the stimulation of a sense like hearing triggers the brain to think of unrelated things like shapes or colors. In Rodrigo's case, hearing songs instantly makes her sense a color.
In a video for Vogue shot as she got ready for her first Met Gala, Rodrigo said that she has ""minor, baby synesthesia.""
""So when I listen to songs I'll like, see colors,"" she said. ""Many songs on SOUR are purple, like 'driver's license' is purple. But 'good 4 u' is like a purpley-blue, 'jealousy, jealousy' is like bright red. 'déjà vu' is like orange and pink and light purple. It's like, lighter and more pastel-y.""
Rodrigo, who donned a light purple Versace gown with matching purple opera gloves and butterfly clips for her Met Gala debut, said that she likes ""having purple as the cohesive color throughout my whole SOUR era.""
Her stylists, Chloe and Chenelle Delgadillo, noted that this was actually Rodrigo's first big event where she went for a purple look to match her album.
""We actually haven't had a purple moment yet, and it's her favorite color, so it just felt right,"" Chloe said of Rodrigo's Met Gala look, joking: ""We were saving it.""
The teen star is midway through her American tour in support of her Grammy-winning debut album, and added some fun fashion elements along the way. During a stop in Detroit in April, she asked fans to wear ""prom attire.""
""Since it's prom seasonnnn I thought maybe we could turn SOUR TOUR into SOUR PROM????"" she asked. ""Would u guys be down? prom attire?""
Rodrigo has also used her tour to make her health care opinions clear, and during her Washington, D.C. stop called out the Supreme Court two days after a leaked opinion draft indicated that a majority of justices would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the right to abortion.
""Because we're in D.C., I couldn't pass up the opportunity to say how heartbroken I am over the Supreme Court's potential decision,"" Rodrigo said Wednesday night, to cheers from the crowd.
""Our bodies should never be in the hands of politicians,"" she continued. ""I hope we can raise our voices to protect our right to have a safe abortion, which is a right that so many people before us have worked so hard to get. It's so important.""
Rodrigo also signed on to Planned Parenthood's Bans Off Our Bodies petition, alongside more than 150 other young artists and creators, to call for reproductive rights. In a full-page ad in The New York Times published on Friday, Rodrigo and stars like Ariana Grande, Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner and many more denounced the decision to overturn Roe.

The ""drivers license"" singer told Vogue in an interview for the 2022 Met Gala that she has ""minor, baby synesthesia."" Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which, when one sense is activated, another unrelated sense is activated at the same time. In Olivia's case, when she hears music, she also sees color. And when she's listening to her own music, she sees a lot of the same color.
Olivia shared with Vogue, ""Lots of the songs on SOUR are purple.""
She added, ""'drivers license' is purple, but 'good 4 u' is like a purple-ly blue. 'jealousy, jealousy' is like bright red. 'deja vu' is like orange and pink and light purple.'""
Olivia's condition also explains why all of her SOUR album cover and march is drenched in shades of purple. In fact, she's made the color part of her signature aesthetic online and on tour.
She said, ""I like having purple as the cohesive color throughout my whole SOUR era.""
The 19-year-old has been making waves in the music industry, snagging three Grammy Awards for her first-time nominations. She also made history as the third youngest artist to win Best New Artist—right behind LeAnn Rimes and Christina Aguilera. And now she is nominated for 13 Billboard Music Awards on May 15.
After embarking on her sold-out SOUR tour, she recently got to meet her idol, Jack White while in Nashville for a Grand Ole Opry performance. In a May 11 Instagram post, she shared the moment she got to meet the ""Seven Nation Army"" artist and fangirl the same way we do for her.
""got to meet my hero of all heroes today,"" she wrote in the post. ""still crying. thank u @officialjackwhite for being so kind to ur biggest fangirl. everyone go listen to fear of the dawn!!!!!""
While we wait to see her at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards, lets take three steps back, listen to that debut album again and see what shades of purple she painted the rest of her songs.

Actress Amandla Stenberg, 16, who played Rue in The Hunger Games brought the 16-year-old actor and son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith to her high school prom.
She shared on her Instagram page on Friday a photo of herself in a shining bronze dress, standing next to Jaden, who sports a black blazer over what appears to be a long, black and cream color block over-the-knee shift dress, paired with black skinny pants, sneakers and a white and gold fingerless glove on one hand.
Jaden, who has been spotted in public wearing a dress before, had also attended another prom earlier this month. There, he also made a bold fashion statement—he sported a white Batman costume.
Amandla also shared more Instagram photos of the two, including one showing Jaden smelling his white rose and baby's breath boutonnière.

0.3846153846153846,"In the 'Cobra Kai' Season 5 premiere, Miguel searches for his father as Terry Silver reveals his expansion plan for the dojo.
Cobra Kai begins its fifth season (and first pre-credits teaser) with a voiceover from villain Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith) and a documentary-style fighting montage. Silver is explaining how he wants to expand Cobra Kai. His spiel is to appeal to a broad range of different people and promises to turn your kid into a warrior. We then see more training montages, kids in combat, and clips of state-of-the-art facilities. Overall, it gives the impression of a safe space.
Chozen Togu (Yuji Okumoto) is performing laps in the LaRusso pool when Amanda (Courtney Henggeler), taking out laundry, gets an eyeful when she sees he has been swimming naked. She's furious and takes it up with Daniel (Ralph Macchio), who tells her it has been a ritual of Chozen's for years. Still angry, she wonders why he needs to be there at all. Kreese is in prison, and she thought all the karate nonsense was behind them. Daniel conveys his fears about Terry Silver and the expansion of Cobra Kai, and is worried Silver will brainwash most of the kids in the Valley. Amanda isn't worried about the kids in the valley; she is concerned about their kids. Daniel promises he will not put his kids in danger.
Miguel (Xolo Mariduena) arrives by bus in Mexico to search for his father. The naive boy gets off the bus smiling and refusing trinkets from sellers on the street hawking their trade. Realizing his phone has no service, he's approached by a group of dodgy-looking guys. Miguel asks them for directions, and they are only too happy to help. Marking an X sign on a map, they start shaking him down for cash. Miguel is happy to reimburse them for their time until he spots the scam: they've taken his bag and now want money in exchange for it. Instead of using his karate skills, he hands over a large chunk of cash and retreats with his tail between his legs.
In the next scene, Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) is leaving a convenience store in Mexico with a bag full of knick-knacks, junk food, and a novelty t-shirt for Robby (Tanner Buchanan), who has tagged along. Johnny offers Robby a Mexican coke, which Robby tells him is just a regular coke. Robby asks his dad what they're doing in Mexico and not to say it's a father/son thing because that could have been done 500 miles away. ""It is a father/son bonding thing,"" Johnny says, ""there's just something we need to take care of first.""
At Daniel's dojo, he tells the kids to gather around and how pleased he is to see them all again. He reiterates they had a goal going into the All-Valley Tournament, and it was to beat Cobra Kai. They had planned to close the dojo if they were beaten. And this is exactly what Daniel is going to do, Miyagi-Do Karate is to be shut down, effective immediately. Samantha (Mary Mouser) and Hawk (Jacob Bertrand) object. Daniel explains his reason for shutting the dojo down — due to Cobra Kai growing more powerful, it puts a target on each of the member's backs. Daniel wants to keep them all safe. Samantha confronts him and says she wants to make things right. She blames herself for losing against Tory at the tournament. Daniel also blames himself and with Johnny gone AWOL, it's on him to fix things, and one of the reasons he reached out to Chozen. For Daniel, it is no longer a tournament; it's real life. Silver will put kids in harm's way without hesitation and Daniel must keep them all out of it.
Miguel finds himself in a boozy establishment. He starts to approach a group of card players and a bouncer stops him. Miguel easily neutralizes the bouncer and speaks to the leader of the group in Spanish, who lets him go. Elsewhere, Robby and Johnny drive along a dirt road. Robby is pissed that Lawrence took him to Mexico and not once mentioned they were searching for Miguel. Johnny tells him he wasn't bullshitting about wanting to fix their relationship. When he heard Miguel was in trouble, he had to do something, and he needed Robby's help tracking down a man named Hector Salazar. Robby wonders what the plan is once they reach their destination and Johnny suggests using a Mexican phonebook. When Robby sarcastically replies putting Miguel's photo on a milk carton, Johnny turns and asks, ""they still do that?"" Robby confesses he'd much rather be at home with Tory (Peyton List). Johnny offers to buy him a ticket at the nearest station. Momentarily distracted, they barely miss a truck and crash in a forest.
Terry Silver is back on TV, demonstrating to Daniel how much this man's influence is beginning to spread. He tells his new ally Chozen that Silver is the antagonist they are going up against. Everyone apparently sees Terry Silver as a kind-hearted, philanthropic figure whose purpose is to save the kids of the Valley, but this is the reason Daniel brought Chozen from Okinawa: to help him cut the head off the snake. Chozen pulls out Sai weapons. Daniel backtracks, telling Chozen he didn't mean for them literally chop Silver's head off. Chozen tells him they are not for cutting, only for delivering a laundry list of deadlier things you can do with the knives. Daniel's plan is to expose Terry as the psychopath he is. He tells Chozen that Terry is smart and two steps ahead of everyone else and to be careful. Chozen points at himself and says, ""No, Daniel-san, you must be careful with this guy. Take me to Terry Silver.""
Samantha is practicing fighting skills and watching footage of her failed battle against Tory. She's in her father's dojo, and she's obsessively recreating the moves from the brawl. There are flashbacks of a triumphant Tory and a beaten Sam. She stares at Miyagi Do's symbol before she receives a call from Miguel. He tells her he's safe and not to worry. He didn't want people to know what he was planning until he'd found his pop, but he'd called her to let her know the process has proven to be far more difficult than he expected. An annoyed Samantha reminds him of his mom and gran and how worried they've been. Miguel informs her that had anyone known, they'd have stopped him. Samantha becomes quite vocal and tells him that maybe there was a reason his mother left Miguel's father. She goes on about his lack of interest in her life and when he tells her there is more to life than karate, she hangs up.
Meanwhile, Johnny and Robby are fixing the car. Robby asks how he got this car in the first place. Johnny relates a story from when Robby went missing and they had to search for him. He found this heap of junk instead and ended up getting into a fight with the guy who stole it. Robby had no idea and seems impressed by the story. Johnny admits he hasn't been there for Robby, more times than he can count and that he's also failed Miguel. He came to Mexico to fix his mistakes, so he doesn't have to live with ""the regret of me."" Johnny calls Carmen, she asks if he is at the bus station, he tells her he had car trouble and will be there in a few hours. Sam has put her mind at rest by telling her about Miguel's phone call. Carmen is worried about what might happen if Miguel finds Hector, a man who is unaware of his existence. Carmen wants to come down to them, but Johnny tells her not to get herself in any danger.
People are flocking to Cobra Kai's grand opening and Daniel and Chozen watch from a car park nearby. Daniel's fears have been realized; Silver is enlisting kids who have no idea what they're getting into. Chozen is unnerved when he sees Silver spar with a couple of boys, telling Daniel he has seen moves like that before. They are from a dark Sensei known as Tang Soo-Do, an old adversary of his father and a Master of Deception who practiced controversial fighting techniques which Chozen demonstrates to Daniel. Chozen also proposes using Silver's tactics against him.
Miguel follows the man he believes is his pop to a colorful outdoor market and is dismayed to see him kiss a pretty young woman and play with a toddler. Miguel tries to chat with the child, and he runs off. Johnny and Robby decide to part company with Johnny handing over some cash so he can catch a train. Johnny gets chatting to the dodgy guys who robbed Miguel at the beginning of the episode, and these fools try their same scam with him. Robby has followed his dad, and together they make short work of the goons. Miguel is still following the family when the little boy runs out onto the street. Miguel saves him and the family is so grateful that they invite this boy into their home for dinner. The pop thinks Miguel looks familiar. Robby and Johnny share a Coke on the beach. Johnny repeats how much of a mistake it was to bring him to Mexico. Robby agrees that maybe some of it was, but at least they got a good story out of it.
Silver's voiceover returns, and it is a turning point for Cobra Ka as he addresses all of his students, celebrating that his enemies have been forced to close up shop and Cobra Kai has more students than ever before — but this means Cobra Kai will need a new Sensei. Right as the episode ends, it is revealed to be... Chozen.
'Cobra Kai' hasn't missed a beat in its fifth season.
You'll want to tune in for the premiere episode.
A powerful ending redeems an episode that feels strangely out of place.
Though fans of the story will be familiar with its beats, they won't have seen it told quite like this.
The fan favorite ""mockumentary"" brings interesting new challenges for its beloved characters.
This new series is building to a historic battle that is best when seen through the eyes of the iconic Hiroyuki Sanada.","Happy summer, and welcome back to the Valley! It’s only been a little over eight months since the last season of Cobra Kai, our shortest gap between seasons yet. And “Long, Long Way From Home” picks up right where we left off, promising another high-stakes season. More than ever, Cobra Kai is the Goliath to Miyagi-Do’s David — though this time, David isn’t even allowed to practice his karate skills to take down Goliath.
Last season started with a bang, immediately giving fans what they wanted with Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso’s new combined dojo. Season five, by comparison, has a lot of housekeeping to take care of; everyone is scattered to the winds with both Eagle Fang and Miyagi-Do forced to disband after their loss to Cobra Kai at the All Valley. That makes for a slightly less exciting start than last time, though the end of the premiere sets up a very promising story line.
Vulture’s weekly newsletter of the best TV and movie recommendations.
Of course, Daniel has no real intention of letting Silver win, and now he has a new ally: Chozen Toguchi, his onetime rival who almost killed him back in 1985 in The Karate Kid Part II. When they made peace during Daniel’s trip to Okinawa in season three, Daniel realized how much Chozen had to offer as a sensei; now he wants his help in exposing Silver and showing everyone in the Valley he isn’t the altruistic philanthropist he appears to be.
At the end of the episode, we see exactly what that means: Chozen is prepared to become a sensei at Cobra Kai and take it down from the inside as a mole. (And hey, if he gets a fat Cobra Kai paycheck from Silver while he’s at it, even better.) It’s a thrilling development: Characters in Cobra Kai are always flipping sides, but we haven’t gotten a real mole story line yet, nor have we seen someone manage to trick Silver and beat him at his own game.
It seems as though there could only be a few possible options to wrap up this story line efficiently, unless Hector decides to step up as a parent and follow Miguel back to California. Regardless, I hope Miguel makes it back soon. The Valley isn’t the same without him.
Luckily, Johnny and Robby are on the move. When Robby first finds out their father-son bonding time is actually in service of finding the kid with whom he’s always competing for Johnny’s attention, he’s pissed. But he comes around quickly enough after Johnny explains that he owes Miguel the same way he owes his own son. Robby decides to stay and help, likely remembering that he, too, has some wrongs he needs to right with Miguel (you know, when he broke his spine after kicking him over a railing at school). When the Australian guys who robbed Miguel try the same gambit with Johnny, he and his son easily handle the situation, the first big fight of the season. There’s the father-son bonding Robby was looking for!
With all this time devoted to the direct aftermath of season four, there’s no time to check in with many of the other characters. We’ll have to wait to see how Tory is handling the revelation that her All Valley victory was based on a lie and how Kreese is handling prison — as well as checking in with Demetri, Eli, Kenny, and Anthony LaRusso, none of whom get any attention in this premiere. Still, even if the season isn’t off to the rip-roaring start season four had, the pieces are here for a great follow-up.
• Sam is still haunted by how the All Valley shook out, rewatching clips of Tory beating her. On a call with Miguel, she gets justifiably angry that he won’t ask about how her fight with Tory went, only for him to ask, “How are you making this about you right now?” Curious what their relationship will look like when he gets back.

0.8,"Olivia Wilde is sharing the recipe for her special salad dressing — which turns out to be taken from a classic novel about divorce.
In her Instagram Stories on Tuesday night, the Don't Worry Darling director, 38, seemingly alluded to the drama surrounding her and ex-partner Jason Sudeikis' former nanny, who wasn't identified by name, spoke about their breakup in an interview with the Daily Mail.
Wilde's post featured a photo from a page in Nora Ephron's 1983 Roman à clef, Heartburn — based on the author's divorce from Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein — in which the main character divulges a recipe for a salad dressing she makes for her husband.
""Mix 2 tablespoons Grey Poupon mustard with 2 tablespoons good red wine vinegar. Then, whisk constantly with a fork, slowly add 6 tablespoons olive oil, until the vinaigrette is thick and creamy; this makes a very strong vinaigrette that's perfect for salad greens like arugula and watercress and endive,"" the recipe read, in part.
The nanny for Sudeikis and Wilde's two kids, daughter Daisy, 6, and son Otis, 8, alleged in the interview that Sudeikis was blindsided and ""brokenhearted"" by Wilde's new relationship with Harry Styles after realizing she was making a salad with the dressing for the Harry's House singer.
For more on Olivia Wilde's salad dressing recipe, listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.
According to the nanny, the Ted Lasso star then ""went outside and lay under her car so she wouldn't leave.""
Both Wilde and Sudeikis have shut down the former nanny's detailed narrative of the fallout of their breakup, calling it ""false and scurrilous.""
""As parents, it is incredibly upsetting to learn that a former nanny of our two young children would choose to make such false and scurrilous accusations about us publicly,"" the former couple said in a statement on Monday. ""Her now 18 month long campaign of harassing us, as well as loved ones, close friends and colleagues, has reached its unfortunate apex.""

Meanwhile, the dressing recipe Wilde posted on Tuesday is similar to the one she shared during an appearance on Questlove's Potluck on the Food Network in 2020.
On the show, the Booksmart director made a roasted salmon salad with zucchini and potatoes. For that dressing preparation, she kept the 2 tablespoons of vinegar but only used 1 tablespoon of mustard and 2-4 tablespoons of olive oil, plus honey, salt and garlic.

They both make a damn good salad. At least that’s according to a new Daily Mail report on her split from Jason Sudeikis. The couple’s former nanny, who says she was abruptly fired with no severance, told the outlet that things came to a head after Wilde left their home with a salad for her new beau, Harry Styles, made with what Sudeikis allegedly called “her special dressing.” The nanny claimed Sudeikis lay down in front of Wilde’s car to prevent her from leaving to eat the salad with Styles. Both Wilde and Sudeikis are attempting to distance themselves from this nanny with a joint statement to Vulture. “As parents, it is incredibly upsetting to learn that a former nanny of our two young children would choose to make such false and scurrilous accusations about us publicly,” they said, describing the story as the “unfortunate apex” of a “now 18-month-long campaign of harassing us, as well as loved ones, close friends and colleagues.” The statement continued, “We will continue to focus on raising and protecting our children with the sincere hope that she will now choose to leave our family alone.” No official word on the salad, though. The report raises many questions, but let’s focus on the simplest: What is Wilde’s special salad recipe?
Wilde’s social media doesn’t give many clues as to how she makes a salad. In 2010, she tweeted about a veggie salad with grilled tofu that she made for Meatless Monday, but the photo has been lost to link rot. In 2015, she tweeted about her affinity for tater tots with ranch dressing. She didn’t seem that interested in salad in a 2013 food diary for Food & Wine, preferring pasta and deep-fried peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. (Same.) Her foodie boyfriend Styles didn’t slip any lyrics about salad into his latest, Harry’s House. Her salad-loving ex Sudeikis praised the salad options on film sets in a conversation with Michael Keaton for Interview in 2013, saying they have “the most beautiful cherry tomatoes you’ve ever seen.” Could that be the secret to Wilde’s salads, too? You can question the veracity of the Daily Mail report, but Wilde did seem to have salad on her mind during the reporting for her Vanity Fair cover profile, when she made “a beautiful, display-worthy salad bowl” in a pottery class.
One of the best clues may be Wilde’s appearance on the 2020 Food Network special Questlove’s Potluck, on which she made a roasted-salmon salad with zucchini and potatoes. Per an online recipe, she dressed it pretty simply with red-wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, garlic, and olive oil. Basically, it’s a riff on a classic French vinaigrette, which sounds good but probably isn’t much different from those on-set salads Sudeikis raved about. Doesn’t sound very special to us — definitely not “worth allegedly getting run over by a car” special.
A day later, Wilde finally decided to give a glimpse of what her special dressing might possibly be. Or most likely, she’s just trolling us because why not at this point? On Instagram stories Tuesday night, she posted a single page from Nora Ephron’s novel Heartburn that detailed a vinaigrette with red wine vinegar, Grey Poupon mustard, and olive oil. She did not confirm if the recipe was, in fact, the rumored one that led her to her relationship with Styles, so the official recipe remains a mystery for now. But hey, Olivia, if you ever want to drop the recipe in a “Grub Street Diet,” we’re sure we can help arrange something.

0.4,"SPOILER ALERT: Do not read ahead if you have not watched Season 3, episode 10 of “The Masked Singer,” which aired April 1 on Fox.
Former New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski is the latest celebrity to be revealed on “The Masked Singer,” as the show’s final nine contestants faced off for the first time on Wednesday night’s episode.
As the White Tiger, Gronkowski performed “I’m Too Sexy,” by Right Said Fred. In previous weeks he performed “Ice, Ice Baby” by Vanilla Ice, “We Will Rock You” by Queen, and “Good Vibrations,’ by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.
Ultimately, Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg and Robin Thicke both thought it was Gronkowski, while Nicole Scherzinger believed it was John Cena and Ken Jeong picked another football player, J.J. Watt.
Gronkowski was the first star to be kicked off in the Super 9, as the final phase of this season’s competition got underway. His exit this season follows Lil Wayne, Drew Carey, Chaka Khan, Tony Hawk, Dionne Warwick, Tom Bergeron, Sarah Palin, Bella Thorne and JoJo Siwa.
Still left this year: Turtle, Kangaroo, Frog, Kitty, Banana, Rhino, Astronaut and Night Angel. While White Tiger was the Group A singer with the least amount of votes, Banana had the least amount from Group B, and Rhino was last in Group C.
For the Super 9, Fox pulled out all the stops: Not only was the episode two hours long, but Nick Cannon brought back his turban, and “Eric from San Bernardino” showed up to pull an April Fool’s prank on the panelists, who thought he was Snoop Dogg.

The Masked Singer just said goodbye to the White Tiger and hello to Rob Gronkowski, the former Patriots tight end who just wanted to show off his unique dance moves on stage.
""I've always loved dancing, and my dance moves were always one of a kind, and I always felt like I was never on rhythm, so when I got asked to do The Masked Singer, I knew I was in,"" he said. ""I wanted to do it. I wanted to learn how to sing and also I really wanted to learn how to dance.""
Apparently his former teammates knew it immediately.
""One or two of my teammates did contact me like, 'dude, that is definitely you. I know your moves.' Like, 'Dawg, I've seen those moves in the locker room plenty of times,'"" he said. I'm like, what do you mean? They're new and improved.""
He also explained that one of his clues was a cow skiing, which referred to his last name: Gron-cow-ski.
White Tiger was the first singer to leave the Super Nine, and next week, the top eight will participate in the smackdown round.
You can keep up with all of the remaining contestants below!
WTF's a Night Angel? She loves the night, has felt deeply blessed her whole life, and doors always open for her. Motel door numbers are 4, 5, and 6, with a 2 on her key. One clue involved gangster grandmas, and if the guess of Kandi Burruss is correct, that refers to her restaurant, Old Lady Gang.
Kandi is currently the leading guess, though Taraji P. Henson and Brandy and/or Monica have also been guessed.
He's definitely got some singing chops, and he took things ""step by step"" while others crashed and burned. He also grills burgers, and he likes to surf OR he won a Teen Choice Award. He says he and Nicole Scherzinger spent a morning together. Comic books are involved.
Jesse McCartney has multiple Teen Choice Awards, was in the boyband Dream Street, and spent a morning with Nicole (and the Pussycat Dolls) on The Today Show in 2008. He also voiced Dick Grayson in Young Justice. It also sounds like Jesse McCartney.
The Frog can clearly move and rap. His clues included a ""newsflash,"" leftovers, $106, and a poster from the 1996 Olympics, and his super clue was a knight.
Our first guess is Bow Wow, who hosted 106 & Park and can obviously rap, and that's who we're still sticking with as some of the panelists, including guest Jay Pharoah, agree with us.
The first reveal of the season was the biggest star yet: Lil Wayne!
The Robot had lots of science references, including a periodic table, since he's had so many records go platinum, but the clues were sort of irrelevant. It's hard to mistake that voice.
The Llama appears to be a comedian on the radio (23.3 The Wool), and he really likes Seattle. He's a fan of the movie Ghost?
The panel decided it couldn't be Howard Stern and guessed David Spade and Joel McHale. The internet immediately went Kelsey Grammar, because of the Seattle of it all, Danny Bonaduce, and Drew Carey. Though David Spade did play a man who turned into a llama in The Emperor's New Groove...
Miss Monster's got a big ol' crush on the Monster/T-Pain, and she seems to have struggled with having to look and act a certain way in public. In week two, her clues heavily referenced royalty. In week three, she revealed she had performed with Robin Thicke.
She sounds exactly like Chaka Khan, though some on the internet also hear some Tina Turner. She is not Dolly Parton, as Ken Jeong guessed. Sorry Ken.
He's somebody with a passion who went from canvassing park benches to leading the charge of a massive movement, parading through the White House. Clues included two blue birds and 10 cent ice cream and a little bit of voguing, and he's just an OK singer.
Panel guesses included Lance Armstrong, Travis Barker, and Tommy Lee, as well as Beto O'Rourke, but no one got exactly there.
She's small and cute and might have something to do with football. Clues include the Warriors, 1979, and gold. She's a good singer with an older-sounding voice.
Guesses included Darlene Love, Dionne Warwick, Maya Rudolph.
The Taco says he's been a comforting part of our lives for decades. Clues include VHS tapes, an anchor, a Rubix cube, and a trolley. His second set of clues included a lot of dancing. He's a pretty good singer with a very old school kind of voice.
Nicole guessed Regis Philbin, who is currently 88 years old and retired. Ken guessed Martin Short, and Bob Saget was also guessed. And now, all we can hear is Tom Bergeron.
She's a hunter and she's been hunted, she's a mama bear who's been in hibernation and who's tired of the ""phony baloney"" and it's so obviously Sarah Palin that the fact that she then sang/rapped ""Baby Got Back"" was beyond shocking.
She's got ""horror vibes"" as Jenny said. There are vampire teeth, and she's felt shame, and she's ""rerun and no fun,"" and ""euphoric, flush with fever."" She likes to do things fast. Also a good singer!
Ken guessed Nina Dobrev, which no. Nicole guessed Jennifer Love Hewitt. Robin guessed Sarah Michelle Gellar.
She was part of a group, a sisterhood, and then a cataclysmic event happened that changed her world forever. The letter U?
Is it just us or does this T-Rex just exude Jojo Siwa? Ken thinks it's a Kardashian and Jenny is closer with Maddie Ziegler, but we just feel like it's Jojo Siwa. She sounds like Jojo Siwa, both when she talks and when she sings. This is our only guess.
It's official: The White Tiger cannot sing, and he can only sort of rap. He's clearly huge and likely an athlete, and is a ""clam shucking"" champion, which makes you think of New England. He loves a celebration dance.
Jamie Foxx guessed Rob Gronkowski and the panelists continued that guess in week two. Gronk is from upstate NY, he's a football champ, and ""Ice Ice Baby""  and ""I'm Too Sexy"" seems exactly like songs he'd sing.
The Kangaroo lost someone close to her, ""by her own admission"" found herself in the spotlight for the wrong reasons, and now she wants to bounce back. She references her bullies and being a survivor, and her little brother is so proud of her.
A lot of people immediately went for Jordyn Woods, who lost her father recently and then found herself in an unfortunate spotlight, and while the voice doesn't sound like Jordyn to us, we can't figure out who it does sound like.
Banana's a bit of a partyer, says he's tough on the outside but a smoothie on the inside. Clues include a blue collar, a blowfish, rodeo, lots of fruits and vegetables. He was offered a rebrand at one point, and the numbers 2, 13, 6, 8, 9, and 15 showed up. He's had or has a mullet, and is not a stand-up comedian, meaning we can't guess Bill Engvall or Larry the Cable Guy anymore.
Guesses now include Billy Ray Cyrus, Brad Paisley, Bret Michaels, Ed Helms, and Darius Rucker.
He's a long way from home, there's a broom, and a foot bone, and a box of tools? He referenced Pitch Perfect at one point, and he is a pretty good singer. He started at a young age. He has broken a world record, and has no formal voice training. New clues include the White House, an accordion, and a plane.
Josh Hutcherson, Lance Bass, Zac Efron, and Donald Glover have all been guesses, but the prevailing guess by the end was country superstar Hunter Hayes.
The Kitty is tired of being seen as what she once was, instead of who she is now. She wants to wipe the slate clean. Clues include a telescope with a wizard, rose petals, and a stage. She likes to sew ""a modern dress for a family member's ball."" She's a pretty good singer, too, and says this is a side no one has ever seen before. Robert Redford helped her get her first role, and she's close with Ana Gasteyer.
A little baffled by this one. The voice still sounds Sarah Hyland or Lucy Hale-ish but the clues don't fit. Some of the clues do fit Kate Bosworth, but does the voice?? No one guessed Jackie Evancho, an opera singer who got 2nd place on AGT when she was 10.
He was addicted to being on top, but he got the help he needed to get back on his ride. ""Is that butterflies?"" Nicole asked. He's got an unexpected voice! His super clue is a slot machine, and music is his passion. He's been on the Billboard charts, and was saved by his wife.
He's athlete-sized, but no one was sure if he was an actual athlete until the mask came off. He's both an MLB pitcher and a musician!
The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on Fox.

0.2058823529411764,"Ariel Robinson, a former contestant and winner of Food Network's Worst Cooks in America, was found guilty of homicide by child abuse in the beating death of her 3-year-old foster daughter by a Greenville County, South Carolina jury on Thursday.
It took about an hour-and-a-half for the jury to deliberate and reach their final conviction, according to local outlet WYFF.
The verdict ended a four-day trial in which Ariel and her husband, Jerry ""Austin"" Robinson, testified. Graphic images of the injuries inflicted on Victoria ""Tori"" Smith were also shown in court.
""In my 13-14 years as a judge, I've never seen anything like this,"" Judge Letitia Verdin said during Ariel's sentencing, per The Sun News. ""Not even approaching it.""
Jerry has not yet been sentenced, but pleaded guilty to his role in the death of little Tori in April, and faces a minimum of 10 to 20 years in prison for homicide by child abuse/aiding and abetting, reports FOXCarolina.

Bill Bouton, an attorney for the Robinsons, did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.
Ariel and her husband were arrested on Jan. 19 last year in connection to the Jan. 14 death of Smith, who died from blunt force injuries, PEOPLE previously reported.
The couple was in the process of adopting the little girl and her brothers and, according to authorities, the hearing to finalize the adoption was scheduled for just days after she was killed, The State previously reported.
Jerry testified during an April hearing that he walked in to find his wife holding a belt and that she allegedly beat the girl because she was frustrated with her, reports WYFF.
""By the time I walked inside, it was as if nothing was going on,"" he said, according to the Greenville News.
He added that he saw the bruising as his foster daughter was crying.
""I told her, 'You went too far this time and I should've stopped it,' "" he said.
During the hearing, Jerry said the girl had thrown up on herself the previous night on her way to church, angering her mother. Ariel's frustration grew the next morning when Ariel allegedly claimed the girl did not eat her pancakes fast enough, he said.
After that, he said Ariel gave the girl a ""whooping"" that he could hear from outside of the home.
Jerry later placed the 911 call. Assistant Solicitor Christy Sustakovitch summarized that call in court, saying Jerry reported, ""We have an emergency, our daughter is unresponsive. She drank a lot of water. We tried to do CPR to get it out,"" according to the Greenville News.

According to local NBC affiliate outlet WYFF, she was convicted of the charge after less than an hour-and-a-half of deliberation, which came after a four-day trial. Robinson's husband, Jerry ""Austin"" Robinson, pled guilty last month to aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse, which carries a sentence of 10 to 20 years. He is currently awaiting his sentencing.
In January 2021, according to local TV affiliate FOX Carolina, police in Simpsonville, South Carolina received a call about an unresponsive child, who was later pronounced dead after being transported to a hospital. Per the outlet, the local coroner identified her to be Smith and determined the cause of her death to be multiple blunt force injuries.
""I think medical testimony in this case was incredibly heartbreaking,"" Judge Letitia Verdin said during sentencing, per WYFF. ""In my 13, 14 years as a judge, I've never seen anything like this, not even approaching it.""
In an April hearing, Ariel's husband, Jerry, accused his wife of ""beating Tori to death"" because she was frustrated with her. During his testimony, he said he walked in to see her holding a belt, saying that he recalled telling her that she went ""too far this time."" Hours before the jury read the verdict in her case, Ariel took the stand in her own defense, appearing to blame her husband for the death, stating that he has some of the ""scariest types of anger issues."" Per WYFF, prosecutors countered the claim by saying evidence showed Ariel was the one who beat Smith and not her husband.
Following the verdict, Jerry's attorney, Lucas C. Marchant, shared a statement to E! News.  ""Mr. Robinson is extremely remorseful for what happened to Tori,"" the statement read. ""He loved her very dearly and he knows that he failed her as her father. He has accepted responsibility for his actions, or rather inactions in this tragic situation. Following this horrific event, he has fully cooperated with law enforcement and the prosecution to bring closure to this case."" E! News has reached out Ariel's attorney for comment and has not heard back.
The former reality show participant won as a contestant on Season 20 of Food Network's Worst Cooks in America, which aired in 2020. When news of her arrest broke in 2021, the network removed the episodes of her competition from all platforms.

0.3333333333333333,"According to her daughter, the actress fought both cancer and COVID ""like a champ.""
Lester Fabian Brathwaite is a staff writer at Entertainment Weekly, where he covers breaking news, all things Real Housewives, and a rich cornucopia of popular culture. Formerly a senior editor at Out magazine, his work has appeared on NewNowNext, Queerty, Rolling Stone, and The New Yorker. He was also the first author signed to Phoebe Robinson's Tiny Reparations imprint. He met Oprah once.
Lee Lawson, a veteran actress perhaps best known for portraying no-nonsense mother of seven Bea Reardon on the popular soap Guiding Light, has died. She was 80.
Her daughter Leslie Bova announced in a Facebook post that her mother had died on May 22, writing that Lawson ""fought cancer and COVID-19 like a champ. Rest, you brilliant, woman ❤️.""
Born Oct. 14, 1941 in New York City, Lawson was married to Joseph Bova from 1970 until his death in 2006. Lawson is survived by children Leslie, Chris, and Gaby, and grandchildren Gianna, Wilder, and Sterling.
Before joining Guiding Light, Lawson played Barbara Sterling on the CBS soap Love of Life in 1965. Splitting her time between the stage and television, Lawson made her Broadway debut in the comedy Cactus Flower opposite Lauren Bacall, replacing Brenda Vaccaro in the role of Toni — the 1969 film adaptation would win Goldie Hawn an Oscar in the same role.
Lawson would star in two other Broadway comedies before the end of the decade, playing the titular role in Agatha Sue, I Love You; and My Daughter, Your Son by Phoebe and Henry Ephron, Nora's parents. During the '70s, Lawson made appearances on Maude, Kojak, and One Life to Live, while acting in the plays The Plough and the Stars, An American Millionaire, and Teibele and Her Demon, in which she starred alongside F. Murray Abraham.
From 1981-90, Lawson appeared in 52 episodes of Guiding Light — the second longest-running drama in TV history — as Springfield's own Bea Reardon, owner of the Seventh Street Boarding House. Reardon used the boarding house to support herself and her seven kids after her husband apparently left them all behind. This being a soap, however, Bea eventually learns her husband was actually murdered, prompting her to leave Springfield.
Friend and fellow actress Marian Hailey-Moss mourned Lawson on her Facebook page. ""My down-to-earth, sassy smart and beautiful friend Lee Lawson is telling it like it is in a better place,"" she wrote. ""A fine actress and a super generous friend. I'll meetcha there Lee!! 1941-2022❤️""","Dave Quinn is a Senior Editor for PEOPLE. He has been working at the brand since 2016, and is the author of the No. 1 New York Times best-selling book, Not All Diamonds and Rosé: The Inside Story of the Real Housewives from the People Who Lived It.
Guiding Light fans are mourning the loss of actress Lee Lawson, who died at Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles on May 22 at the age of 83 after a decades-long fight with cancer.
The uniquely sharp comic actress is known for playing Bea Reardon on the CBS soap from 1981 to 1990. Her daughter, Leslie Bova, shared the sad news in a Facebook post, explaining that her mother also had COVID-19 before her death.
""Rest, you brilliant woman ❤️,"" Leslie said Tuesday. ""Thank you, mom. R.I.P.""
Lawson was born in New York City in 1938. She made her screen debut on the CBS's Love of Life in 1965 and went on to appear in ABC's One Life to Live in 1979 (as Wanda Webb Wolek) before booking her role on Guiding Light as the owner and operator of the 7th Street boarding house (and a single mother of seven).
She appeared in over 50 episodes of the series, which aired its finale in September 2009. The show is the second longest-running drama in American television history, having aired for 72 years on radio and television.
Her last episode saw Bea appearing in a video message to her daughter Chelsea (Kassie DePaiva), to share sweet words of support on her wedding day.
Actress Marian Hailey-Moss remembered her friend with love in her own Facebook post Monday, writing ""My down-to-earth, sassy smart and beautiful friend Lee Lawson is telling it like it is in a better place. A fine actress and a super generous friend. I'll meet you there Lee!""
In addition to her appearances on daytime soaps, Lawson also acted on a number of other popular programs, including Howdy Doody, The Gabby Hayes Show, Maude, Kojak and Equal Justice. She also starred in the TV movie Mason about a boy genius.
On stage, starred in the hit Off Broadway play The Knack (directed by Mike Nichols) before making her Broadway debut in the musical Hot September in 1965. She played opposite Lloyd Bridges in the 1965 comedy Cactus Flower, starred as the title character in 1966's Agatha Sue, I Love You, and premiered Max Frisch's Firebugs in New York.
Her role in the live tv production of Landford Wilson's The Sand Castle in 1970 earned he rave reviews. Other stage roles included My Daughter, Your Son (1969), The Plough and the Stars (1973), An American Millionaire (1974) and Teibele and Her Demon (1979).
After acting, Lawson achieved a lifelong ambition by gaining a doctorate in clinical psychology, and enjoyed a fulfilling successful second career in Los Angeles as psychologist and crisis counselor.
She was married to Joseph Bova from 1970 until his death on March 12, 2006. Lawson is survived by three children — playwright Christopher Stetson Boal, Gabriella, and Leslie — her sister, artist Susan Gray Arlow, and her grandchildren Wilder, Sterling and Gianna.
""Thank you for having Chris, me and Gaby so that we could have Gianna, Wilder and Sterling,"" Leslie wrote on Facebook. ""We love you.""

Charli XCX is reflecting on her time on Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour. Back in 2018, the Grammy winner invited Charli and Camila Cabello to open for her on the highly-anticipated tour, which Charli seemed very excited about at the time.
""I AM SO EXCITED THANK U TAYLOR FOR HAVING ME,"" the ""Boom Clap"" singer tweeted in March 2018.
But, after playing over 50 stadiums on the tour, it sounds like Charli has changed her tune.
""I'm really grateful that [Taylor] asked me on that tour,"" the 27-year-old says in her cover story for Pitchfork, published Tuesday. ""But as an artist, it kind of felt like I was getting up on stage and waving to 5-year-olds.""
And it seems as though Charli is done opening for any artist, ever again.
""I've done so much of it, and it really cemented my status as this underdog character, which I like now,"" she tells Pitchfork. ""But I need to just own my own f--king s--t finally.""
After Charli's interview started to make headlines, she took to social media to address her comments about the tour.
""Hey [heart emojis] a few people on the internet have taken something I said out of context and I want to clarify there is absolutely no shade and only love here!"" Charli wrote. ""As I say in the article and have said many times before, I am extremely grateful to Taylor for inviting me to open for her. She's one of the biggest artists of my generation and the reputation tour was one of the biggest tours in history.""
""In the printed version of this much wider conversation my answers about this tour were boiled down into one kind of weird sentence,"" Charli continued. ""Leading up to that tour I'd been playing a tonne of 18+ club shows and so to be on stage in front of all ages was new to me and made me approach my performances with a whole new kind of energy – more so I talked about how it was brilliant opening for Taylor, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity I was given and how much fun it was to perform to a new audience!""
""Any tour I've been on with any other artist as an opening act has always taught me so much,"" she added. ""It's always wonderful to watch other artists do their thing, own their stage and speak their language to their dedicated fan bases – and this was especially true for the reputation tour.""
When Charli wrapped up the tour with T.Swift in November, she wrote that she was ""happy"" she got to be a part of a ""huge tour"" with ""great people.""
""OMG TOUR IS OVER!!!! IF U SAW ME LIVE THIS YEAR COMMENT THE NAME OF THE CITY U SAW ME PERFORM IN BELOW!!! I wanna reminisce!!!!!"" Charli told her fans on Instagram. ""I feel happy and sad all at once. Happy that I got to be a part of such a huge tour with so many great people (example - @taylorswift @camila_cabello @broodsmusic), happy that I got to perform my songs in such huge rooms to so many new people, happy that a lot of those people actually knew those songs (LOL!) and happy that I got to throw my own parties along the way for the hardcore angels who like to rave until 5am once everyone else has gone to bed hehe. Sad because... well it's all over now!!!""

0.3333333333333333,"A judge has revealed the fate of the ""Operation Varsity Blues"" mastermind.
Former college admissions adviser Rick Singer was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison and three years supervised release on Jan. 4, per NBC News, for his role in a seven year scheme that secured children of wealthy, powerful families acceptances to top schools, including USC, Georgetown, and Yale. Dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues"" by the FBI, those caught up in the scandal included Full House alum Lori Laughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli as well as Felicity Huffman.
Rick pleaded guilty in March 2019—the month the admissions scandal broke— to racketeering conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. He was arrested in Sept. 2018 and subsequently cooperated with authorities, which included becoming ""a cooperating witness"" and wearing a wire to implicate some of the parents, according to NBC News. Prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence for the 62-year-old, per CBS News, while his defense attorneys asked for a year of home confinement, or a maximum of six months behind bars.
""For most of my life, if not all of it, I have thrived on winning at all costs,"" Rick wrote in a letter submitted to the courts Dec. 28 and obtained by CBS News. ""My moral compass was broken and, increasingly over time, choosing right over wrong became less important than doing whatever had to be done to be recognized as the 'best.'""
He added that he is remorseful and is currently living in a trailer park for seniors in Florida and can't get a job despite attempting more than 1,000 times.
In their own letter, the defense team noted how Rick's inability to land a job after the scandal has hurt his self-esteem and cited the work he has done to start over in his community.
""His unwanted notoriety has left him unemployable, depriving him of his self-esteem,"" the defense said. ""He has tried to rebuild by volunteering in his community. He has boundless energy and ideas about programming for youth and the underserved. He would be an asset to society if permitted after sentencing to continue his community service efforts.""
Rick's sentencing comes after more than 50 people were charged in the scheme. Among the parents and university officials convicted, former Georgetown University tennis coach Gordon Ernst, received two and a half years in prison for taking more than $3 million in bribes. In 2020, Lori and her husband pleaded guilty for securing fraudulent admission to the University of Southern California for their two children, Olivia Jade, 23 and Bella Giannulli, 24.
According to the FBI affidavit obtained by E! News in 2019, Lori and Mossimo ""agreed to a pay bribes totaling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the USC crew team—despite the fact that they did not participate in crew—thereby facilitating their admission to USC.""
The actress was sentenced to two months in jail, a $150,000 fine and 150 hours of community service, while Mossimo served almost five months, a $250,000 fine and 250 hours of community service.
Felicity, who was convicted of mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in 2019, served 11 days in prison.

Rick Singer was sentenced to 42 months -- 3.5 years -- in federal prison for his role in the Varsity Blues scandal.
Remember ... the feds say Singer was the architect of a massive, decades-long fraudulent scheme to get high school students into elite colleges and universities across the country ... including the daughters of celebs like Lori and Felicity.
TMZ broke the story ... prosecutors were pushing for Singer to get 6 years behind bars, arguing he profited from the scheme more than anyone and therefore deserved a much longer sentence than the parents, college coaches and others received.
Singer's lawyers, meanwhile, asked for a maximum of 6 months in the big house.
It's worth noting ... more than 50 parents, coaches and associates of Singer's received sentences ranging from 30 months in prison to just probation. Lori was sentenced to 2 months behind bars, while Felicity got 2 weeks.
Singer was initially staring down a maximum sentence of 65 years behind bars ... but he ended up cooperating with the feds and was the key to convicting the parents and coaches. Prosecutors say Singer wore a wire at the government's direction to nail the targets, and also made hundreds of recorded calls.
Now, Singer's going to con college.",Eonline,Tmz,,,
0.4444444444444444,"Dune director Denis Villeunevei recently said, ""In the second one, I will have time to develop some characters that were left aside a little bit""
Some Dune fans expected to see more of Zendaya in the sci-fi film.
The new film debuted in theaters and on HBO Max Thursday, bringing the epic, futuristic world of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel to life, but one takeaway some viewers had was disappointment that Zendaya didn't play a leading role despite being a major part of Dune's marketing campaign.
""The credits were longer than Zendaya's camera time in Dune,"" tweeted one person, while another added, ""Am I the only one disappointed that I only saw Zendaya for like 15 minutes in DUNE? I waited over 2 hrs to see her speak on screen. All the other actors were incredible too. But I was like WHERE IS SHE?!""
According to the Los Angeles Times, Zendaya appears on-screen for about seven minutes total across Dune's 2-hour-and-35-minute run time.
In the movie, the Emmy winner, 25, plays Chani, who bookends the film as a narrator and appears in snippets throughout in dreams of the protagonist Paul, played by Timothée Chalamet. Spoiler alert: The two characters finally meet at the end of the movie, when she tells Paul, ""This is only the beginning.""
Director Denis Villeuneve recently explained to the LA Times that this movie covers about half of the novel, with more story to tell and more Zendaya to come as her character soon takes the forefront.
""There are some characters that are less developed that I'm keeping for the second film — that's the way I found the equilibrium,"" he said. ""We tried in this movie to stay as close as possible to Paul's experience. Then, in the second one, I will have time to develop some characters that were left aside a little bit. That's the theory. I hope it will work.""
On Tuesday, Legendary, the production company behind the film, confirmed that a second Dune installment is in the works, slated for release two years from now in October 2023.

Earlier this month, Zendaya told Good Morning America while promoting the film alongside Chalamet, 25, that ""this is really only part one"" to ""such a beautiful story.""
""There's so much more to explore with these characters, with this world,"" she added. ""I think Denis has done a beautiful job of setting it up for those who maybe haven't grown up with it in the same way. I would love to be able to revisit these characters. I got a little small, small bit of time to hang out with everybody, and I would absolutely love to do it again. Because I feel like I learned so much. It was one of the coolest experiences of my life.""
Also in the cast are Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Stellan Skarsgård, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Dave Bautista and Charlotte Rampling.
Zendaya told PEOPLE about working with Chalamet, ""I'm just so grateful that this experience has been with this guy because he's massively talented but also such a good person. We've been able to have fun and become great friends.""
Dune is now playing in theaters and streaming on HBO Max.

After the film was released last week, fans took to social media to express their frustrations that the actress appeared in the film for only a brief amount of time.
""Zendaya is only in Dune for 7 minutes,"" one follower tweeted. Added YouTuber Machaizelli Kahey (a.k.a. MacDoesIt), ""The credits were longer than Zendaya's camera time in Dune.""
In the film adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel, Zendaya plays Fremen warrior Chani and appears in a handful of scenes. According to the Los Angeles Times, she narrates the opening of the film and then makes a few appearances throughout the dreams of protagonist Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). But spoiler alert, she doesn't reappear until the end of the film when she and Paul meet.
Considering Zendaya has been featured in Dune's trailer and poster and has been promoting the film on its press tour, many viewers expected her to have a bigger role in the movie.
So what gives? The filmmakers' interview with the Los Angeles Times may have the answer.
According to the newspaper, the movie covers only two-thirds of the book. Denis Villeneuve explained ""this movie is really focused on Paul"" and he hopes to shine a light on the characters who didn't get as much (or any) attention in the sequel.
""There are some characters that are less developed that I'm keeping for the second film—that's the way I found the equilibrium,"" he said. ""We tried in this movie to stay as close as possible to Paul's experience. Then, in the second one, I will have time to develop some characters that were left aside a little bit. That's the theory. I hope it will work.""
A second film, you say? Yep! Warner Bros. just announced that the Dune sequel will be released in October 2023. And it looks like viewers could see more of Zendaya this time around.
""God knows there's a lot of story left to tell,"" Eric Roth, who co-wrote Dune with Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, told the L.A. Times. ""A lot of [the sequel] will be concerned with the Fremen and what their political strategies are. You'll get into the relationship with Paul and Chani. And then, of course, there's always the villain.""
To be fair, Zendaya had hinted that she didn't have a large role in Dune before its release. Still, it looked like she enjoyed the experience.
""My part is very, very small in this movie and that's why I'm so excited to see it, to see what everyone's been up to,"" she said in an August interview with Empire. ""[Denis and I] had a little discussion about who Chani is and the strength she possesses. She's a fighter, that's what her people are. I only really had a few days with her, so I kind of scratched the surface but it was so much fun figuring her out. What does she walk like, what does she talk like? This is her planet, so how does she navigate this world? It was so fun.""

0.4615384615384615,"Saturday Night Live brought us a great episode last night with host Selena Gomez and with it came a brand new sketch about the hit show Old Enough. The long-running Japanese show sends kids out on errands for their parents to start giving them independence. It's cute to watch, and the entire town where these kids live seem in on the bit and even in bigger cities, no one really bats an eye at kids going out to run some errands.
The American version is a...bit different. In the Saturday Night Live version titled ""Old Enough! Long-term Boyfriend,"" we get to see as Kelsey (Gomez) sends her boyfriend of three years Matt (Mikey Day) on an errand to get her some make-up at Sephora and to the store to pick up two shallots. Matt just turned 34 and Kelsey really thinks that he can do this for her, but she's nervous to send him out into the world by himself.
What's so great about the real version of Old Enough is that the kids have to remember a list of things all on their own and then come back home. Sometimes it results in tears and kids having to try and remember what their parents asked of them. In the Saturday Night Live version, it's sort of the same thing. Meaning that even 34-year-old Matt has a little bit of a cry in the Sephora when he can't remember what kind of make-up he was supposed to get and says a ""Smash Mouth Nightwing"" instead of the requested Smashbox Eyeliner Pencil in Night Mist.
Matt meets another boyfriend on an errand, a 38 and a half year-old man played by Kenan Thompson, before he makes it to the grocery store and grabs two bags of onions instead of the shallots that Kelsey asked for in the first place. Much like in the show, she's so happy he's home, but Kelsey also instantly wants to break-up with Matt because this is just all not the relationship she wants.
It's a hilarious sketch poking fun at not only how Americans probably would adapt a show like Old Enough but also what long-term boyfriends can start to act like once a girlfriend just does a lot of stuff for them in the first place. We don't need an American version of the show, but this is a great sketch about Old Enough.

HBO became the premiere place for original shows in the 90s.","Selena Gomez made a strong showing during her hosting debut on last night’s Saturday Night Live, and no sketch is a better example of her comedic talents than this send-up of Netflix’s Old Enough! The show, where Japanese toddlers are tasked with running errands on behalf of their parents, gets an American twist in which long-term boyfriends take the place of the toddlers. Kelsey (Gomez) gives her boyfriend of three years, Matt (Mikey Day), very clear instructions to pick up eyeliner from Sephora and shallots from the grocery store, but Matt is overwhelmed and confused from the jump. After bursting into tears and running into a fellow man-baby boyfriend played by Kenan Thompson, Matt returns with “ten pounds of onions and a blush palette for African American women.” Gomez is note-perfect as the long-suffering girlfriend, especially when she confesses she’s had a glass (or bottle?) of wine at 10 a.m. Watch the full sketch above.

Bobby Flay will keep heating up Food Network!
The 56-year-old celebrity chef has signed an exclusive, new three-year contract with the network, Discovery Inc. confirmed in a statement shared with PEOPLE Monday.
""I'm thrilled to extend my relationship with Food Network and Discovery,"" Flay said in the statement. ""Although these talks to renew took a little longer than expected, the important thing is that both sides are happy that we can now build on an already rock-solid foundation. Stay tuned for some incredibly exciting new shows as I promise to take food and cooking to places we've never imagined before.""
The Beat Bobby Flay has signed on to stay once his current, three-year contract expires at the end of 2021. In October, Variety reported that he would be parting ways with Food Network after 27 years, after both parties could not agree on financial terms.
At the time, a source close to the celebrity chef's team told PEOPLE that Flay was negotiating for a deal that would be above Guy Fieri's recent $80 million contract. The payday reportedly made the Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives host the highest-paid chef on cable TV.
""Bobby wanted a contract in the ballpark of $100 million,"" the source said.
However, another source close to Food Network told PEOPLE comparing the two stars' contracts was ""not apples to apples.""
""Guy has a three-year deal,"" they explained. ""The terms of what Bobby was looking for were gravely different than just cash. The terms were longer, the scope of work was different and thus the dollars were different. It's not just $80 million to $100 million.""
Though Flay's new paycheck remains undisclosed, he will develop new content for the culinary channel and elsewhere within the Discovery portfolio as part of the deal.
""We are thrilled to continue Bobby Flay's long standing relationship with Food Network. He captivates our audience with his incredible culinary skill, fierce competitive spirit and his trademark ability to share a deep passion for food,"" Courtney White, President of Food Network and Streaming Food Content for Discovery Inc., said in a statement. ""Bobby generously invites viewers into his culinary world, sharing his #WeCook philosophy and inspiring everyone in the kitchen. Continuing this creative relationship with such an extraordinary talent is the perfect way to usher in the holidays.""
Flay has been a longtime star on Food Network, making his debut in 1994 and co-hosting his own series, Grillin' & Chillin', by 1996. Since then, the chef has hosted numerous hit shows — including Boy Meets Grill, Beat Bobby Flay, Food Network Star, Throwdown! with Bobby Flay, Brunch @ Bobby's, and Iron Chef America.
Earlier this year, he launched a podcast with his daughter Sophie — titled Always Hungry — and saw the opening of his first Italian restaurant, Amalfi.
As Beat Bobby Flay continues, People Food Editor Ana Calderone was recently on the set of the cooking competition, for an episode airing in 2022.
By clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.","Bobby Flay and Discovery’s Food Network have reached an agreement on a new three-year contract, a deal that comes about six weeks after negotiations stalled because the sides were too far apart on financial terms.
The celebrity chef, restaurateur and author has set an exclusive pact that will keep him in the Discovery family through the middle of the decade and up to his 30th on-air anniversary with the cabler. The new contract also expands the scope of content opportunities available to Flay’s Rock Shrimp Productions, which produces most of his shows for Food Network. And the wide-ranging deal comes just as Discovery is poised to grow significantly through its pending merger with WarnerMedia.
Food Network executives ended talks with Flay’s representatives at WME in early October after what sources described was an impasse over financial terms and the scope of the deal. Flay’s negotiations with Food Network came in the shadow of fellow network personality Guy Fieri having made headlines in May by setting an eye-popping three-year deal valued in the high eight-figure range.
In an interview with Variety, Flay acknowledged that there were tense moments and a long pause in a tough negotiation. He also noted that he’s taken quite a few meetings in recent weeks and realized the depth of the demand for food-related TV content, from cooking shows to travelogues to kitchen-verite documentaries to wacky culinary competition series.
“Every single major network and single streaming service has, to use a pun, a very big appetite for this programming,” he said.
But in his travels, Flay said he did not find an outlet that felt like a better fit than the channel where he has worked for most of his adult life. Flay first appeared on Food Network in 1994 and within two years was co-hosting his own series, “Grillin’ and Chillin’.” He’s been a regular on the channel’s air ever since with his most recent series including the cooking competition “Beat Bobby Flay” and his tour of New York City culinary delights in “The Flay List,” co-hosted with his young adult daughter Sophie.
Flay’s long tenure on Food Network has also put him in a position to serve as a mentor and coach for less experienced Food Network talent, especially the entrepreneurs who, like Flay, juggle multiple jobs as TV personalities and producers, chefs and restaurateurs.
For all the fame he’s gained on TV, Flay still sees himself as a restaurateur at heart. “My restaurants are the most important thing to me,” he said. “It’s what keeps me passionate.” Flay’s portfolio is in flux thanks to the pandemic, but in May he opened a new establishment, Amalfi, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
As a business owner, Flay said he’s been impressed by all that Discovery has brought to Food Network since it acquired the cabler’s former parent company, Scripps Networks Interactive, in 2018. And now that Discovery CEO David Zaslav is about to take the company through another growth spurt with the WarnerMedia merger, Flay sees plenty of opportunity ahead for him and Rock Shrimp Productions.

0.2666666666666666,"Blink and you'll miss some of the super famous celebrities that have dropped by Westeros over eight seasons of Game of Thrones.
Everyone from entire metal bands to professional athletes to Ed Sheeran have popped up in the fight for the Iron Throne. How many of these cameos did you manage to spot?
Snow Patrol may sound like a group of Night’s Watchmen on the lookout for frozen wights, but as fans know it’s actually an Irish indie rock band. However, lead singer Gary Lightbody did get to visit the world of Westeros during his cameo as a Bolton soldier.
He appeared in Season Three’s third episode, “Walk of Punishment,” singing, “The Bear and The Maiden Fair.” The song is about a bear licking honey off a “maiden fair,” which takes on a sinister tone considering the disturbing things to follow in the episode.
Richard E. Grant is a Swazi-English actor and screenwriter. He’s known for his roles in Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Downton Abbey, and Doctor Who. Also, he was in Hudson Hawk. Grant cameos as an actor/playwright, portraying the arrogant Izembaro in Season Six.
He plays Tywin Lannister in a play within the show, so let’s see if we can get this right: Richard E. Grant is an actor and writer who plays an actor and writer who plays Tywin Lannister in a play within a show. Wow, this show has multiple layers… no wonder there’s an “Onion Knight.""
Kevin Eldon is an English comedian and actor, and has played roles in Hot Fuzz, and The IT Crowd. He’s actually played a couple of characters in Game of Thrones: as Camello, a member of Izembardo’s comedic theater troupe in Season Six. He plays a cartoonish version of Ned Stark, much to Arya’s dismay.
He also plays a Gold Cloak in Season Seven, who gets bribed to allow Davos (Liam Cunningham) and Gendry (Joe Dempsie) to escape with Tyrion (Peter Dinklage). However, after seeing Tyrion, they grow too suspicious, and they meet their demise at the business end of Gendry’s sword.
Neil Fingleton was an English actor and basketball player, with the title of tallest man in the European Union at seven-foot-seven. He played Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg, the king of the giants, and member of the Free Folk army. His steed is a mammoth, and he and Dongo are the last of the giants.
Unfortunately, they both meet their end in the episode “The Watchers on the Wall,” but their memorable appearances were both truly epic additions to the ever-growing mythos of Game of Thrones. Tragically, Fingleton passed away in 2017 of heart failure.
Ian McShane is an English actor who has appeared in Deadwood, American Horror Story, Ray Donovan, American Gods, and the films, Kung Fu-Panda and John Wick. He’ll reprise his role of Al Swearengen in the 2019 Deadwood HBO movie, of which he’s also an executive producer. McShane played Septon Ray on Game of Thrones, a member of the Faith of Seven.
He nurses The Hound (Rory McCann) back to health (or back to life?) after finding the latter with a broken leg and being eaten by bugs. Ray has a strong influence on The Hound, enough so that following Ray’s murder, The Hound goes on a vengeance-fueled axe-rage.
Mastodon is an American heavy metal who are featured in the most perfectly metal roles. They’re first seen as background wildlings in the episode “Hardhome,” as recently-turned wights. They reprise their roles in Season Seven, once again being featured as frozen, shambling wights.
There’s even a kickass behind-the-scene photo of Brent Hinds, face covered in blood, posing with a White Walker making devil horns. Already equipped with full bushy beards, we can’t think of anyone more suited to the role of crazed reanimated wildlings.
There were a couple of familiar faces in the Season Eight premiere, for the more observant viewers. Rob McElhenney is an actor most well-known for portraying Mac in It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He’s also a creator, writer, and producers of the show. His razor-sharp wit and quiver full of barbs were not enough to save him in Game of Thrones, however, as he played one of the Ironborn guards holding Yara (Gemma Whelan) hostage.
Of Monsters and Men  are best known for hitting the top of the charts with both their 2011 debut album My Head Is an Animal and their single ""Little Talks."" The Icelandic folk-rock band appeared in the sixth season as stage-bards in the play, “The Bloody Hand.” The scene is watched in horror/disgust by Arya (Maisie Williams) as they lampoon her dead family, portraying the events between Ned Stark and the Lannisters in cartoonish fashion.
Fortunately, they don’t seem to befall any horrible fate, unlike some of the musical cameos to come. One of their albums is titled My Head is an Animal, which is very Game of Thrones-esque, especially considering Robb Stark’s blood-curdling fate.
British rock group Bastille makes a sneaky appearance in the Season Seven finale ""The Dragon and the Wolf”. More specifically, the band’s keyboardist Kyle Simmons pops up as a shambling White Walker following the nefarious Night King beyond the wall and into Westeros.
It actually makes a lot of sense casting a guy from a band called Bastille to play an undead soldier. The undead are basically rebelling against both the living and the concept of death, which is kind of like a class struggle. And the storming of the Bastille was a major event in the French Revolution. There are layers here, man.
One theme of Game of Thrones cameos is that they play to their respective celebrities’ strengths. Such is the case with Will Champion, the drummer for Coldplay. He appeared in Season Three’s “The Rains of Castamere,” and played, well, a drummer.
But not just any old drummer: he’s a secret assassin, who takes part in the ultimate betrayal in the Red Wedding. You could say he slayed his drum solo... as well as a bunch of Starks.
The creative forces behind such appropriately-titled albums as Blood Mountain and Emperor of Sand secured their place on the show in 2015, when they came out with a track called “White Walker,” which appeared on the Game of Thrones: Catch the Throne Vol. 2 mixtape to promote the fifth season of the show.
It was an episode reminiscent of Helm’s Deep, but with far, far more zombified children. Royd Tolkien has also cameoed in The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King as a Gondorian Ranger, and in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug as a Burier of the Witch-King.
Animal Circus is a rocky/reggae/ska band based in London, featuring actor/musician Joel Fry. Fry made an appearance on Game of Thrones as Hizdahr zo Loraq, a former slavemaster and nobleman. He's the pickup artist trying his able-bodied best to get with Daenerys (Emilia Clarke).
He’s briefly engaged to Daenerys, but unfortunately get shish kabobed repeatedly after an encounter with the Sons of the Harpy. Hopefully his musical career is more successful than his political career in Westeros. Joel Fry has also acted in a number of other TV shows and movies, including 10,000 BC.
It’s important to give all character actors and actresses credit, even those that walk on four legs and weigh 1,000 pounds. Bart the Bear is an accomplished ursine actor, who has appeared in such films as Doctor Dolittle 2, Into the Wild, and has cameoed in Season Three of Game of Thrones.
Bart, like most actors, lives in Los Angeles, and his scenes were filmed in his hometown (due to the flight restrictions on huge bears, and of course, the fact airlines nickel and dime you over honey and berries). He portrays a bear (he’s typecast) who fights Brienne in a pit. While it’s true Brienne (Gwendoline Christie) only gets a wooden sword to defend herself, she’s tough enough that it’s almost a fair fight.
Dr. Feelgood is a British pub rock band, featuring guitarist Wilko Johnson. He plays Ser Ilyn Payne, a man of few words (his tongue was pulled out with hot pincers by the Mad King). He uses a very different axe in the show than in his musical career, given that he’s the royal executioner.
In fact, he’s the one to behead Ned Stark (Sean Bean). His guitar style is described as “choppy,” so we’d say he plays true to type. At least he slays just as well in real life as he does in Westeros.
Ed Sheeran’s contentious cameo is no secret: the red-headed pop singer/songwriter was much reviled by GoT fans, who thought his appearance in Season Seven spoiled the immersion. But what the audience may have missed was his ultimate fate, mentioned off-handedly in Season Eight.
As Bronn (Jerome Flynn) is keeping company with several sex workers, a couple of them mention a particular Lannister soldier’s gruesome death by dragonfire: “That boy, Eddie… the ginger? That’s him. Came back with his face burnt right off.” The fans demanded their pound of flesh, and the writers happily delivered.
David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, co-creators and showrunners of Game of Thrones, couldn’t resist a small cameo, and a gruesome one at that. Their faces were used as molds to furnish a couple of the shelves in the Hall of Faces, a somewhat garish museum of skinned dead-people’s faces, used by the Faceless Men (along with some magic) in their assassination disguises.
What did the co-creators do to wind up as a pair of floppy masks? Maybe some disgruntled fans requested the services of the Faceless Men, after seeing that loathed Ed Sheeran cameo. Maybe Sheeran's face is somewhere in there too.
A less macabre cameo was made by David Benioff’s parents in the Season Four premiere. They get a background role as an older couple of peasants walking arm-in-arm on their way to King’s Landing. It’s a sweet tribute to his parents, though unfortunately, one can imagine they’ll have to languish under the insufferable rule of Joffrey.
Benioff’s parents are far from peasants in real life: his father is Stephen Friedman, former chairman of Goldman Sachs and United States President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. Hopefully, their cameo is an indication that Benioff has a better relationship with his parents than the fraught familial relations on Game of Thrones. And if you’re wondering: Benioff changed his last name to his mother’s maiden name so that he wouldn’t be confused with other writers that share his name.
Noah Syndergaard is a baseball player and pitcher for the Mets. And like many Game of Thrones cameos, he’s given the opportunity to showcase his unique talents: by tossing a spear, and burying right into a Dothraki horse’s chest.
That’s a home run, but unfortunately, Syndergaard’s name proved prophetic: one of those pesky dragons turned him into a pile of charcoal briquettes. At least he got one last epic pitch in before getting burninated off the face of Westeros. He has 612 strikeouts, as of April 27, 2019, or 613 if you count that Dothraki horse.
Aaron Rodgers might be one of the best quarterbacks in recent history, but NFL stats don’t mean much in Westeros unless you’re a kick returner who can outrun dragonfire. Rodgers announced on his Instagram account that he would show up in the Season Eight episode “The Bells,” and people have had a difficult time spotting him.
Many GoT cameos are of the “blink and you’ll miss them” variety, so it isn’t that unusual that fans would have trouble picking out the Super Bowl MVP. However, most people agree that Rodgers is the unfortunate man caught in a blast of raging dragon’s breath.
Speaking of The Lord of the Rings, another Tolkien creation makes a cameo in Game of Thrones: Glamdring, Gandalf’s trusty sword, has somehow wound up upon the titular iron throne. It’s a little disturbing to think that Joffrey’s (Jack Gleeson) butt may have touched anything associated with our favorite fantasy wizard.
Does that mean Gandalf was defeated by Aegon Targaryen? Is that possible? We hope not, although it’s true that Gandalf hasn’t had the best of luck when it comes to great big fire-breathing monsters.
Steve Love is a Canadian actor and YouTuber, whose channel is devoted to impersonating Game of Thrones characters. Fortunately for Love, his impressions caught the attention of casting directors, and he was given a short-lived (literally) role in Season Six.
Love played “Steve,” a member of the Brotherhood Without Banners. He’s goofing around with his companions, when The Hound approaches from behind and quickly frees Steve’s head from the rest of his body, as revenge for Septon Ray (and the rest of the flock’s) murder.
Neil Marshall is a director working for Game of Thrones, and was behind the episode “Blackwater,” which revolved around the battle between the Lannisters and Stannis Baratheon’s army. Marshall has also had his share of cameos, including an archer on The Wall as they fend off wildlings.
Marshall practices archery in real life as well, allowing him to convincingly pick off wildlings with his bow. In addition to directing Season Four’s, “The Watchers on the Wall,” Marshall has also directed several horror-action films including Dog Soldiers (featuring Ser Davos himself, Liam Cunningham).
Sigur Rós is an avant-garde Icelandic rock band, known for eerie, angelic vocals. They’ve recorded a cover of “The Rains of Castamere,” but they’ve also appeared on-screen as musicians at Joffrey’s ill-fated wedding breakfast in the episode, “The Lion and the Rose.” Joffrey petulantly throws coins at the bards to get them to leave, and apparently even though the prop coins were made of rubber, one of the band members was hit in the forehead and hurt.
Yet one more reason to hate Joffrey. Although in actuality, the actor who plays Joffrey, Jack Gleeson, seems to be a lovely person and was in no way responsible for the coin-to-forehead incident. He’s retired from screen acting and is now part of a Dublin-based theater company called Collapsing Horse.
The Greyjoys are apparently lousy with hapless Ironborn guards. In the Season Eight opener ""Winterfell,"" one such guard portrayed by Martin Starr, an actor and comedian known for his roles in Freaks and Geeks, and Silicon Valley, in which he portrays Bertram Gilfoyle.
Starr’s Game of Thrones character is quickly dispatched via an arrow bolt to the prefrontal cortex. Though it may be hard to recognize him without his trademark glasses, he does a fantastic job of looking momentarily stunned before collapsing of fatal arrow-itis.
Roy Dotrice was a British actor, who narrated the A Song of Ice and Fire audiobooks. He’s done other audiobook work, and has been nominated for a Grammy award for his narrations. With his distinctive voice and connection to the series, he was originally slated to have a larger role in Game of Thrones as Grand Master Pycelle.
Unfortunately, Dotrice had to withdraw due to medical reasons. He ended up getting some screen time after all, appearing in a brief cameo in Season Two episode nine as the Pyromancer, Hallyne. Sadly, Dotrice passed away in 2017, at the age of 94.
Though unfortunately George R.R. Martin’s bearded, bespectacled face has never been seen in Westeros via our TV screens, he was, in fact, featured in the Game of Thrones unaired pilot episode as a Pentoshi nobleman attending Daenerys’s wedding to Drogo (Jason Momoa). After they recast Daenerys, Martin’s scene was cut. He’s been offered further cameos, but he’s turned them down, probably using the excuse that he’s got more books to write.
Sure buddy, more “books,” wink wink nudge nudge (he’s totally playing Xbox all day every day). But if he’s not giving us more books, is it really too much to ask for him to make an appearance that makes the cut on Game of Thrones? Maybe as a Citadel maester or an older Sam Tarley? We can dream, can’t we?
Bryan Cogman has written eleven episodes of Game of Thrones, as well as the book Inside HBO’s Game of Thrones. Luckily, he gets to go inside Game of Thrones, literally, with his secret cameo as a Dragonstone servant who serves dinner to Stannis Baratheon and his wife, Selyse.
Cogman won’t, however, be serving us up the rumored prequel series to Game of Thrones, as HBO has recently cancelled the project. Maybe the rotting meat he was forced to serve his king was some sort of grim, cosmic foreshadowing.
This one’s a bit of a cheat, since it’s not so much a cameo in Game of Thrones, but in Solo: A Star Wars Story. Very good boy and actor doggie Saxon plays Nymeria, Arya’s direwolf in Game of Thrones. Nymeria is technically a female dog, but Saxon is a skilled enough actor that he can play the opposite gender.
Nymeria was last seen roaming free in the wild, so hopefully she’ll make a return in Season Eight and we’ll get to bask in the inspired performance of Saxon again. He also plays a Corellian hound, an alien dog-like creature in Solo: A Star Wars Story, chasing after his GoT’s castmate Emilia Clarke. Truly, he is a versatile artist. The one question we have of this canine star: who’s a good actor? Is he a good actor? He is! Yes he is a good actor!
“I was like, you know, I would gladly fly to wherever in the world just to be a small part and get to watch that show going down,” Stapleton told Rolling Stone. “They were gracious enough to let me come participate that way.” Stapleton wasn’t alone: his bass player J.T. Cure and tour manager went to Northern Ireland to take part in the epic battle as well.
These characters would have ruled so much better!

It Chapter Two, the highly anticipated follow up to the 2017 horror hit remake, hits theaters on Thursday, Sept. 6, with Bill Skarsgaard back in action as Pennywise, once again making people question their weird attraction to a scary AF clown.
But this time around, Pennywise won't be terrorizing a group of young friends dubbed the Losers' Club; It will be going after the group 27 years later after they all return to Derry, each with their own trauma stemming from their first deadly encounter with the Dancing Clown.
As soon as Chapter One, fans immediately began dream-casting the adult versions of the characters created by Stephen King, with the young stars even offering up their ideal picks to take over their roles. And some of them even got their wish, like Stranger Things star Finn Wolfhard.
Other stars, however, needed to submit childhood photos to convince the producers they were the right person for the job.
So just how uncanny is the resemblance between the adult and child stars of the It cast?
X-Men star James McAvoy takes over from Jaeden Martell as the leader of the Losers' Club. As an adult, Bill is now a successful novelist.
According to Martell, the Oscar nominee was the first choice to take over the role, telling USA Today that director Andy Muschietti ""always wanted James McAvoy to play it. I was just super excited about that. I'm flattered.""
As dream-casted by many fans before the casting news became official, two-time Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain plays the adult Beverly, who is a successful fashion designer stuck in a string of abusive relationships following her childhood abuse. Sophia Lillis became one of It's breakout stars after playing young Beverly in the 2017 hit film, going on to star in HBO's Sharp Objects and playing the famous Nancy Drew in Warner Bros.' big-screen adaptation.
For adult Beverly, Chastain was the producers' first and only choice, and even toyed with adding a post-credits at the end of the first movie that would reveal the big casting news.
It's fitting that Saturday Night Live vet and Barry star Bill Hader is stepping into the role originated by Stranger Things' Finn Wolfhard in the first film, as Richie grew up to become a stand-up comedian, putting his foul language undoubtedly to good use.
While Hader is a celebrated Emmy winner, he credited Wolfhard for landing him the job.
""Finn got me the job,"" Hader said during the press conference for It Chapter Two. ""He said, 'I want [Bill Hader] to play it,' and then my agent sent me a link saying, 'Hey, look at this.' I was like, 'Well that's nice,' and then months later my agent called me and said, 'Andy Muschietti wants to meet you for It Two,' and I was like, 'Finn must be the most powerful person in Hollywood.'""
While the rest of the Losers' Club left town, Chosen Jacobs' Mike stuck around Derry, Maine, with Shadowhunters star Isaiah Mustafa playing the older iteration of the character, who is now a troubled librarian that brings the childhood friends back together when It returns.
This casting news seems to be kismet, as Mustafa actually means ""chosen"" in Arabic.
Power star Andy Bean plays the grown-up version of Stanley, who is now working as an account in Atlanta and is married to a school teacher, taking over the role from Wyatt Oleff.
After being bullied as a kid for being overweight, Beauty and the Beast hunk Jay Ryan will play the adult slimmed-down version of Ben, who is now a successful architect, filling in for Jeremy Ray Taylor.
Ryan recently revealed he ended up being cast as the adult Ben after sending in a childhood photo.
""So they asked, to get me over the line, could I send photographs of me at the age Jeremy was in It Chapter One,"" Ryan told USA Today. ""I look very similar to Jeremy. It sealed the deal.""
Taylor was skeptical when he first heard the casting news...until he saw the photo Ryan sent him, saying, ""I lost it. Our eyes are uncanny. We both squint a lot. And our mannerisms are the exact same.""
James Ransone portrays the adult version of the hypochondriac Eddie, first played by Jack Dylan Grazer, who would go on to star in DC's hit movie Shazam!. 27 years later, Eddie runs a limousine business in New York City and is married to a woman who is just as overbearing as his mother was.
it isn't the only villain back to terrorize the club in the sequel; after being committed for murdering his father and two friends in 1989, Teach Grant takes over from Nicholas Hamilton as Henry after he escaped from an insane asylum to go after the Losers.
It Chapter Two hits theaters on Sept. 6.

0.7142857142857142,"After spending the entire summer hiatus dreaming of the Arizona/Callie reunion we didn’t get to see on-screen, we’ve officially arrived back in Seattle to find that no time has passed since the surprise double wedding that capped off season 14.
Picking up just one day later, season 15 of Grey’s Anatomy kicks things off in “With a Wonder and a Wild Desire” with a bang, literally, as the first hour opens with that steamy scene from the trailer between Meredith and DeLuca. However, despite their drunken wedding reception kiss in the finale, the doctors aren’t actually getting it on. Instead, Meredith is having a very vivid sex dream, something made abundantly clear thanks to surprise appearances from Jackson and Tom Koracick (Greg Germann). Friends, Meredith Grey needs some love in her life, stat.
Still in town, Teddy makes her way over to Owen’s to presumably break the news that she’s taking over for Miranda as Interim Chief of Surgery…and oh yeah, she’s pregnant. However, after being greeted at the door by Betty and quickly getting up to speed on the pseudo-family situation going on with Owen and Amelia, she backs out.
Feeling supremely hungover from the weddings, Jackson, Maggie, and a reluctant DeLuca make their way towards Grey Sloan Memorial. While Jackson and Maggie talk about the wedding and taking leaps of faith, DeLuca spots a car careening towards them and saves the duo’s lives. However, the biker riding next to them isn’t so lucky and the car collides right into her. Thus, the first medical trauma of the season has officially arrived.
The biker, a woman named Neesha, is all tangled up in her bike, but even her severe injuries can’t temper the feeling of pure euphoria of waking up surrounded by hot doctors. As she’s being treated by Owen, Jackson, Grey Sloan’s new Ortho God Dr. Atticus “Link” Lincoln (Chris Carmack), and his sidekick Dr. Nico Kim (Alex Landi), Nisha maintains she must be in heaven.
Meanwhile, Meredith is taking charge of Cece, a two-time heart transplant recipient, whose kidneys are now starting to fail. Witnessing DeLuca apologize for the kiss and vow to never let it happen again, Cece, a successful matchmaker, sets her sights on finding Meredith love.
While the others are occupied with Neesha and Cece, Richard, DeLuca, and Intern Roy treat Barry, whose wife takes him into the ER for what he calls “stomach pains,” but actually turns out to be a large object stuck up his rectum. Barry is less than forthcoming about what said object is, eventually revealing it’s his wife’s “hair stuff,” which Roy takes to mean “shampoo.” On the table, however, they discover that it’s actually hairspray too late as the can bursts into flames, catching Roy on fire.
Luckily, making his second save of the episode, DeLuca is able to stop Roy from becoming toast, but unfortunately, Barry dies on the table.
Following a very awkward run-in with Amelia and Owen at Grey Sloan during which she reveals she’s leaving, Teddy finds herself back at the hospital and in need of attention from Grey Sloan’s resident Cardio chief. Confirming Teddy’s self-diagnosis of a blood clot in her leg, Maggie doesn’t just give Teddy some meds and send her on her way, instead suggesting she stick around for observation. The bad news prompts Teddy to blurt out a few details about her pregnancy and Maggie — and Intern Parker, who clearly wants to be excluded from this narrative — are able to work out that Owen is the father, only to be sworn to secrecy.
Recovering from the wedding festivities on their beachside honeymoon, a Boston-bound Alex and Jo begin to ponder their future and build sandcastles. While Alex is looking ahead at the possibilities waiting for them in Boston — their future children playing in the snow! — Jo has a major breakthrough in her research that could change the future of medicine.
With word going around the Miranda is still on the hunt for an Interim Chief, candidates start piling up, much to her chagrin. Trying to hop on a “fun” surgery, Miranda is instead ambushed by Richard, Owen, and Meredith, who all throw their hats in the ring.
The night’s second episode, “Broken Together,” opens with yet another sex dream featuring DeLuca, this time with the addition of Ortho God Link. Mer arrives in the kitchen to find Maggie and a lot of milk in her fridge. Also seeking refuge over at Meredith’s is Amelia, after her reconciliation almost-sex with Owen is curbed by a full house. Maggie spills the beans about Jackson’s proposal — despite the fact that they haven’t said “I love you” yet — and then almost drops the Teddy bombshell.
The honeymoon has quickly come to an end for Jo and Alex, who cut the vacation short following her killer cancer cell breakthrough. Jo wants to continue her research in Seattle with Meredith, who vows to get her the necessary fellowship. Finding Bailey in the new state-of-the-art hyperbaric chamber a.k.a. the “Moon Spa,” Mer pitches a surgical innovative fellowship for Jo, only to be shot down due to lack of funds. Unfortunately, Jo has already called Boston to pass, leaving her without a job in Boston or Seattle.
During the night, Neesha and Cece’s conditions each worsen, as Neesha develops necrotizing fasciitis, a flesh-eating bacteria infection. Jackson, desperate for Neesha to survive, is able to convince Bailey to let him operate on Neesha in the hyperbaric chamber. However, he can’t use electricity in the chamber so he and Intern Schmitt are going old-school. During the surgery, Schmitt accidentally reveals that Maggie thinks he proposed, which comes as a shock to Jackson as he definitely didn’t propose to Maggie.
Meanwhile, after crashing a few times, Maggie performs a biopsy and learns that Cece has congestive heart failure, meaning she needs new kidneys and a new heart. Cece, who is more focused on Neesha’s recovery is devastated when she learns Neesha didn’t make it, tells Meredith and Maggie that she doesn’t want a new heart. She eventually has a change of, well, heart, after Mer admits that maybe she needs some help from a master matchmaker.
Speaking of love, while Meredith may be under the tutelage of a matchmaker, two of the hospital’s on-again/off-again couples may finally be a good place.
After treating a couple involved in a motorcycle crash, Amelia and Owen have a long conversation about their earlier reservations getting back into a relationship that comes with strings, they decide to go for it, strings and all. Hopefully, they’re savoring this moment now, because the strings are going to get very tangled once the news of Teddy’s pregnancy comes out.
Jackson and Maggie also have a heart to heart, where they talk about how much Neesha’s death is affecting him. Maggie indicates to Jackson that some of his feelings may be PTSD from all the major recent events in his life, from April to his family. He accepts that she may be right, also pointing out the good things in his life, and they profess their love for one another.
Meanwhile, Miranda is still dealing with the Interim Chief business. After Richard approaches her, once more, she reveals that she knows he hasn’t been attending AA meetings. Their exchange is cut short by Jo (and Alex) who, despite being slightly drunk, is determined to get this fellowship and succeeds. Miranda breaks the news to Meredith that Jo is the inaugural Surgical Innovative Fellow with a major caveat: Miranda is funding the program, and if Meredith has a problem, she can take it up with the Interim Chief because it is not her problem at the moment.
So who is Interim Chief? None other than Alex Karev. And with that, Grey’s is officially back.","Dearest Grey’s fam: Have you, too, spent the entire summer hiatus stewing in anger over the forced departure of two Grey’s Anatomy queens? Oh, you have a life in which you deal with actual people and not fictional ones? Tell me what that’s like some time. I was all ready to hop on this recap train and start bemoaning the fact that the show cut two wonderful female characters and yet still has an entire gaggle of ridiculous interns running around (literally, in this episode, one of them is just chasing a dog the entire time), but then Grey’s Anatomy did something very smart: It distracted me with shiny new hunky doctors. I can’t help myself! Like, I’m sorry but did you see Dr. Lincoln’s (Chris Carmack’s) hair? Hunky Doctor with Great Hair is my exact type and I won’t apologize for that.
Apparently, I’m not the only one. Our main patient of the episode, Neesha, doesn’t hide her swooning over the docs, mangled legs or not. When we first meet this nice, young woman, Jackson, Maggie, and DeLuca are walking to work, still feeling the booze from the wedding festivities the evening before, but enjoying a gorgeous Seattle morning. Jackson and Maggie are deep into conversation about taking leaps of faith and higher beings and other things everyone totally talks about when they are incredibly hung-over, so they don’t notice the car careening toward them — but DeLuca does. He pulls both of them back, out of harm’s way just in time. Neesha is not so lucky. She’s riding her bike when she gets slammed by the runaway car and ends up completely entangled in her bike. As I like to remind you people, I am in no way a doctor, but I’m pretty sure your legs aren’t supposed to bend like that.
When Neesha comes to at the hospital, she is convinced she’s in heaven because she is surrounded by very attractive angels: Jackson, Owen, new orthopedic surgeon Dr. Lincoln (he prefers to be called Link), and his equally attractive ortho cohort Dr. Nico Kim (Alex Landi). Neesha may be standing on the brink of death but at least the view is pretty.
Vulture’s weekly newsletter of the best TV and movie recommendations.
Jackson gets attached to Neesha — it could easily have been him in that hospital bed. Why should Jackson get to live, and not her? Jackson’s existential crisis is a real drag. He has no sense of humor when it comes to Link recounting his days working in a Venice Beach bike shop, calling him and Owen “bud,” or the loud music he plays during surgery to clear his head. He does not, however, seem to mind the season tickets Link has access to as the personal surgeon of the Seattle Mariners. Boys are weird!
Neesha is not the only patient in the hospital because of the car accident. The driver of the car that hit her had passed out at the wheel before hitting Neesha and running into a tree. Cece is a two-time heart transplant recipient and is going into kidney failure due to the anti-rejection meds she’s been taking for her heart. Some people just can’t win. She falls under the care of Meredith Grey. And our hero is having a day even before she meets Cece.
As many may have guessed, that promo showing Meredith and DeLuca going at it was just a very, very hot dream of Meredith’s. Jackson and Tom Koracick make appearances, as well. Meredith is horny, you guys! The dream makes run-ins with all three of those men a little awkward, but most especially with DeLuca, who just wants to apologize for drunkenly kissing her at Alex and Jo’s wedding. He’ll never do it again, he says. That’s a shame, because I’m kind of into them. Meredith chooses this moment, of all moments, to finally decide it’s inappropriate for an attending and a resident to have a relationship. Grey Sloan was basically built on breaking that rule, but FINE.
Cece won’t let Meredith off so easy. As it happens, Cece is a professional matchmaker, and a good one — she has an 85% success rate. Meredith repeatedly tells her she’s not interested in her services, but Cece won’t give up so easily.
Both patients are having some trouble staying alive (and have formed a bond while suffering through all this), but Neesha is definitely worse off. She develops necrotizing fasciitis, a rapidly spreading flesh-eating bacterial infection that is also extremely hard to spell. The former is the more important part here, but I wanted you all to know.
They need to act fast or it could be fatal. Jackson comes up with a risky plan, but he’ll need to talk to Bailey about it, first. Like Meredith, Bailey has also been having a day. She desperately wants to go on her sabbatical, but still needs to find an Interim Chief. It was supposed to be Teddy, but after Teddy discovers that Owen and Amelia are playing house, she wants to get as far away from Seattle as possible (a blood clot in her leg keeps her grounded for now, with only Maggie knowing the truth about the identity of her baby daddy). When other doctors catch wind of Bailey’s need, everyone starts (poorly) pitching themselves to her. So when Jackson comes to her with a big request, she isn’t in the best mood.
Bailey has just put the finishing touches on a state-of-the-art hyperbaric chamber meant to speed up patient recovery time. Link calls it a “Moon Spa.” Really, it looks like a submarine in the basement of the hospital. It is a cool set piece and I can’t wait for multiple instances of people getting trapped in there and banging on the tiny porthole windows for help. It is inevitable.
Jackson knows that there are higher success rates with necrotizing fasciitis when the patient is treated in a space with high-flow oxygen. It’s science! He wants to perform Neesha’s surgery inside the hyperbaric chamber. It’s definitely not equipped for that — no electricity allowed — he’d be putting his entire team at risk of decompression sickness, and once the door closes they’ll all be stuck in there until the entire thing is depressurized. Jackson doesn’t care. He needs to save this girl and this is his best shot.
To the Moon Spa they go! Things go bad pretty quickly. The infection has spread and Neesha crashes. There is no defibrillator, so they have to do compressions manually. They work on her for 35 minutes until finally Jackson brings himself to call her time of death. Immediately, he needs to get out of there, away from the horror show. Maggie and Bailey helplessly watch him freak out from outside the chamber (told ya!). Jackson can’t leave until it’s safe to open the door, so he sits there facing what’s happened.
If you think that’s sad, wait until Meredith and Maggie tell Cece that Neesha is dead. Cece breaks down. She blames herself and she doesn’t want to be put back on the transplant list (her heart starts failing because of her kidney failure, again — there are no breaks to be caught for Cece). She doesn’t deserve to live if Neesha is dead. It’s heartbreaking. Meredith will have none of it. She’s had yet another sexy dream (this time Link and his abs join the party), and watched other people follow their joy, and she’s ready to admit that maybe she needs — she wants — Cece’s matchmaking services. Cece needs to keep fighting because Meredith is ready for her help. Their first session begins at Cece’s bedside.
Emo Jackson’s day doesn’t end so horribly, either. Earlier, Jackson admits to Maggie that after what happened with April, he is starting to believe in something bigger, a higher power — and that’s embarrassing for him. He talks about trusting his gut and taking a leap of faith and all of this leads into a weird pseudo-proposal type moment. This of course freaks out Maggie, who immediately takes off to buy milk (which she actually does — her commitment to the ruse is noble). After Neesha dies and Jackson realizes that the “half-proposal” was not what he meant at all, he and Maggie talk things out. Jackson’s had a tough year, what with everything that went down with his grandfather, losing his family fortune, watching April move on — he can admit that he has some issues he’s been avoiding. But, he adds, something else big happened this year: he fell in love. Jackson and Maggie say “I love you” for the first time. So, anyway, that whole thing is not going anywhere.
Before we wrap this up, there are two seeds of storylines planted in these premiere episodes that we really need to discuss. The first is what’s going on with Richard Webber. At the end of last season, we watched as he lost his long-time sponsor. I’m so glad the show hasn’t just dropped this thread — a loss like that would be devastating to someone like Richard. He’s not handling it well. Catherine knows it. Bailey calls him out on it. And yet he’s still avoiding going to an AA meeting. Keep an eye on Richard, I’m worried.
The second is a possible burgeoning romance. Hottie Doc Nico Kim arrives at Grey Sloan and almost immediately takes a liking to doofus intern Schmitt. You guys, Nico winks at him during surgery. Schmitt is definitely taken aback by Nico’s forwardness, but the wonderful thing is, it is never played for laughs. We’ve only seen Schmitt hook up with Jo, so we don’t know if he’s ever had a relationship with a man before, but the look on his face when he and Nico accidentally graze hands at Joe’s Bar says that he is having some feelings. Is this happening? Please say yes.
• Did you ever think you’d live to see this day, people? ALEX KAREV IS CHIEF OF SURGERY. Okay, Interim Chief, but still. It all has to do with Jo turning down the job in Boston to stay in Seattle and work on her brilliant idea for the future of medicine (Cancer Killer Cells) through a fellowship personally funded by Bailey. Still, the takeaway here is that Evil Spawn is now the Chief. Somewhere in Switzerland, Cristina Yang is cackling.
• Here’s hoping Link is more than just another hospital Lothario, although how could you not enjoy Meredith’s first encounter with the flirty doc? A fast and hard “no” before he even had time to introduce himself. A Savage Queen, our Meredith.
• I regret to inform you that Link does not utter the words “Welcome to Grey Sloan, bitch” nor does he say, “Welcome to the Hyperbaric Chamber, bitch.” But you can bet your butt I am watching out for it.
• Is Tom Koracick staying forever? I kind of love him?
• Um, you guys, Grey’s Anatomy just had a guy die on the table after sticking his wife’s hairspray can up his butt. That must be the WORST way to go out, don’t you think? His poor wife! It’s not funny but also … I love this show.
• Well, Amelia and Owen are back together. I laughed out loud during his big “I want the strings” speech, when, amongst the messy things he wanted as part of their “Take Two,” he listed “the fighting.” Only Owen Hunt would want that. Everyone hated the fighting, dude. This is a horrible idea. Still, I am looking forward to his reaction once he learns Teddy is pregnant with his child. Somebody please tell him.
• Sob Scale: 4/10Cece singing to Neesha or her tearful breakdown after learning the young woman has died — you take your pick, but either way, I’m over here wiping away some tears.

We have Will & Grace star Megan Mullally to thank, in part, for that emotional rollercoaster of an episode from HBO's The Last of Us.
Nick Offerman appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night and told the host that it was his wife who gave him the final push to play Bill on the show.
Offerman previously told EW that he initially didn't have time in his schedule to take on the part of a prepper who finds love with a survivor Frank (Murray Bartlett) after the world falls apart in the face of a fungal plague.
""I'm a huge fan of [series co-creator] Craig [Mazin], and so I knew, 'Here's a script from Craig and it's for his new show and it's going to be something very special,'"" he said in a January interview. ""It was in a time when I didn't have time to go do it, so it was this immediate dilemma. I didn't even want to read it.""
Fortunately, Mullally — Offerman's ""incredible goddess of a wife"" — read the script and urged him to do it. ""She said, 'You're going to Calgary, buddy. Have fun! You have to do this,'"" he shared with Jimmy Kimmel.
Kimmel showed Offerman tearful video reactions viewers have been sharing on social media after watching the episode, which was a contained story about Bill falling in love with Frank and finding happiness together despite the unforgiving world around them.
""It's a tsunami of wonderful, generous plaudits,"" the actor said. ""The episode began airing on Sunday. We had 6.4 million viewers, and HBO… they are so not f---ing around that they send me on the Jimmy Kimmel show on Wednesday to cull the stragglers. They're like, 'The 17 of you who haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat.'""
Offerman told EW that he felt a kinship with the Bill character when he read the script for the first time.
""He can weld and build and fabricate anything. I'm like that to a much lesser degree. I love to make things,"" Offerman said. ""Part of that competence, that sensibility, I think, is fear based. It allows me to feel like I'm in control of my immediate surroundings, so nothing bad's going to happen to me. I can never die because I can build a roof. I think for maybe both Bill and I, that's a way that we protect ourselves from having to feel things.""
The Last of Us airs Sunday nights on HBO and streams on HBO Max.","Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally are one of Hollywood's funniest couples.
Comedy is not only what both do professionally, but it's also key to their marriage. As Offerman told PEOPLE Now in 2020, ""First and foremost we [make] each other laugh … I think that's at the heart of if any relationship is gonna survive, you have to be able to laugh about things.""
""We just got lucky,"" he added. ""We adore each other. We're two human beings so it's a relationship that requires work and patience and maintenance. I'm sure I drive her up a tree sometimes and that's when I go and sleep out in the backyard. Then I write her a letter and she lets me back in the house.""
Offerman and Mullally met in 2000, when they starred in the play The Berlin Circle. Mullally told New York magazine in 2010 that they weren't romantic until after previews, but once they started dating — spotting coyotes and a Glen Campbell concert at the Hollywood Bowl were part of their courtship — ""it got serious and we were never apart from then on.""
The couple got engaged in London in 2002 and married in a surprise wedding at their Los Angeles home in September 2003, on the night before the Emmys. Ever since, they've had a two-week rule when it comes to taking gigs.
""We made a deal that any job that's going to keep us apart for more than a couple of weeks, we discuss,"" Offerman told New York.
Many of those jobs have been with each other. Though they've done plenty of projects apart, Offerman and Mullally have worked together well over a dozen times.
Fifteen years after The Berlin Circle, they received praise for their roles in the play, Annapurna. They've also appeared in each other's TV projects — Offerman guest-starred on Will & Grace and had a recurring role on Childrens Hospital, while Mullally played the recurring role of Tammy Swanson on Parks and Recreation. On the big screen, they've starred in nine movies together, including 2002's Stealing Harvard, 2012's Smashed, 2013's The Kings of Summer, 2015's Hotel Transylvania and 2017's Infinity Baby. Off-camera, they co-wrote the 2018 book The Greatest Story Ever Told and hosted a podcast, In Bed With Nick and Megan.
It may seem like they're always working, but the couple does know how to slow down. ""My favorite thing to do is just stay home with the dogs and read or watch movies and be together,"" Mullally told PEOPLE in 2016.
""We really like each other, and we try to treat each other well,"" she continued. ""I feel like Nick and I have the best relationship and the best marriage.""
From their meeting in 2000 to their many on-screen collaborations, here's everything to know about Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally's relationship.
The funny duo met when they starred in the Evidence Room Theatre Company's production of the play, The Berlin Circle, in L.A.
""We had a lot of scenes together, and I started thinking, 'Wait a minute, he's funny.' And then I started thinking, 'Wait a minute, is he cute?' What's happening?"" Mullally told Buzzfeed in 2013.
At the time, Mullally had wrapped season 2 of Will & Grace and Offerman was sleeping on a friend's basement couch.
""I was pre-disposed to not be impressed by this TV lady. I didn't have a TV. But when we did the first read through with a cast of 25 sitting in a circle, Megan just stuck out as so hilarious,"" Offerman told Sundance TV's ""The Mortified Sessions"" in a 2011 joint interview with his wife, adding, ""Megan took a chance on me. It was quite the roll of the dice that she rescued me from the squallor I was living in at the time.""
At the time, Mullally was 41 and Offerman was 29, though Mullally initially assumed he was much older. When she found out Offerman wasn't in his thirties, she ""was pissed.""
""I thought he looked old!"" she told GQ in 2017 of her age miscalculation. ""And he was mature, so when I found out he was 29, I said these two words: You motherf-------. And I almost ran my car off the road.""
Though he had never seen an episode of Will & Grace before meeting Mullally, Offerman told IndieWire that starting with season 3, he only missed a couple of tapings.
The American Ham star also appeared alongside Mullally on the sitcom, playing Nick the Plumber (who gets to smooch Mulllally's Karen Walker!) in the 2001 Thanksgiving episode, ""Moveable Feast: Part 2."" Offerman would later reappear on the Will & Grace revival, dating both Will and Grace in the new series' first season in 2018.
Offerman fake-proposed three times in Paris before officially popping the question. He told Playboy that the Will & Grace costume designer helped him with the bit by giving him faux disposable rings. Once they were in London, which the Making It co-host told The Guardian was ""our favorite city in the world,"" he really did ask for Mullally's hand in marriage.
""It was in Regent's Park that I bent my knee and presented my hand-carved, walnut, heart-shaped ring box,"" he said. ""Magically, the ducks on the water and birds in the air began to furiously copulate all around us. Something made the moment bigger than the two of us. It was fated by Mother Nature.""
Offerman described himself as being in a ""heigtened state of agitation"" ahead of the real proposal, which Mullally told Playboy she noticed. ""I couldn't figure out what was up with him,"" Mullally said. ""He was sucking and chewing on his mustache like crazy. I thought to myself, 'What is going on? He has never chewed on his mustache before!' ""
The couple married in a private ceremony at their Hollywood home. The wedding was a surprise to their guests, who included Mullally's Will & Grace costars Eric McCormack, Sean Hayes and Debra Messing.
""We had our family and closest friends fly out and told people we were having an Emmy party,"" Mullally told Entertainment Tonight at the time. ""When they arrived, we said, 'Welcome to our wedding!""
Ten years later, Offerman shared what led to their decision to marry, ""We fell in love, and before long, we could just tell that we wanted to stay together and make a life together,"" he said during an interview with the A.V. Club. ""We wanted to declare to each other and our friends and family that we were in it to win it.""
Mullally was previously married to casting director Michael A. Katcher from 1992 to 1996, while this was the first marriage for Offerman.
Mullally won two Emmys for her role as Karen Walker on Will & Grace, and Offerman was right by her side for her second win in 2006 for best supporting actress in a comedy series. Though she didn't thank her husband in her speech, they did share a kiss after she was announced as the winner in her category, which came after the NBC comedy's final season.
The couple temporarily left L.A. when Mullally took on a starring role in the Broadway adaptation of Young Frankenstein. Always supportive, Offerman saw the play 25 times.
""Sometimes when your wife says, 'Hey, can we move to New York so I can do this Mel Brooks musical?,' you take a deep breath and say, 'Yes, we can, honey,' and you pack a bag of chisels and hand planes,"" he said to The New Yorker in 2018.
""I am a very big fan of Megan's work in musical comedy,"" he added. ""She can rip it, and then she can snap it, and then she wraps it up with a bow, and shoves it straight up your keister.""
For Mullally's 50th birthday, Offerman paid tribute to his wife by writing a tune called ""The Rainbow Song."" In 2015, he filmed a video for the charity, MyMusicRX, to go with the song. In typical Offerman fashion, the tune is full of puns and seemingly random references (leprechauns! Cialis! Peppermint Patty!) and manages to make prison jokes about marriage quite funny.
The couple have costarred in many projects together, but it was Mullally's stints on Parks and Recreation that really sealed the deal on their working relationship. She appeared as Tammy, the ex-wife of Offerman's character Ron Swanson, in 10 episodes. Her first appearance was on the season 2 episode, ""Ron and Tammy.""
""When Megan came on Parks and Rec as Tammy 2, that was kind of a watershed moment for me where we were treated like peers, like a team,"" Offerman told PEOPLE in 2014. ""Up until that point I'd felt like Megan's student and fan. So once that happened, those particular roles required a lot of trust and vulnerability to go to horrifyingly deep places, especially with our tongues. So I feel like we've graduated to a level where we can look at each other and jump off any cliff together.""
""There is a nice sort of security working together, but I also feel like we're more relaxed,"" Mullally added.
The duo stripped down for a portrait to accompany their joint 2010 New York magazine interview, an idea that was all Mullally's.
""Neither of us are paragons of physical perfection. That's why I pitched that nude-photo idea: It's as if we were Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, but of course we're not,"" she told the outlet. ""Yet before we met with you, Nick told me how beautiful I looked in my pajamas in the hotel. I didn't really, by somebody else's standards, but it's very nice to hear that, especially as an actress in Hollywood. Nick has said he would divorce me if I got Botox.""
The actors starred together as exes in a West L.A. production of Annapurna, which had only been produced once before they took it on. ""We said, 'Well that's a happy accident – it's a two-person play and both parts are right for us,'"" Mullally told PEOPLE in 2014.
After a successful stint on the West Coast, they brought the play to New York for a seven-week off-Broadway run.
The biggest animation project the two collaborated on was 2015's Hotel Transylvania 2, though they didn't get to record together due to their work schedules.
While promoting the film, Offerman discussed what he found so funny about his wife's work. ""Like all things she touches, she has such a golden talent in animation,"" he told PEOPLE. ""And the most mundane line like, 'Can I get you a wash cloth?' just cracked me up. She is somehow able to make every single line really funny.""
Other animations the pair have both lent their voices to include the shows Bob's Burgers and The Great North (Offerman is the lead in the latter) and the 2012 movie, Ernest & Celestine.
Offerman and Mullally hit the road together for a national tour of their variety show, ""Summer of 69: No Apostrophe"" in 2015 and 2016.
Mullally told PEOPLE that their joint venture worked because ""we have so much fun together,"" with Offerman adding, ""I look at us as one of those old-fashioned showbiz couples. We write the show together and head out on the road.""
In a joint interview with GQ, the couple discussed their family planning. ""I never had a burning desire to have children,"" Mullally said. ""But then I met Nick, and I thought 'This is the only person I'd do this with.' So we tried, but I was a little long in the tooth for that sort of thing. But we didn't turn it into a soap opera. We tried for about a year or so, and it didn't happen, and took that to mean it wasn't meant to be.""
Fifteen years after their wedding, the couple released a joint memoir, The Greatest Love Story Ever Told. Offerman told The Guardian that while it was a ""sincere memoir of our romance,"" it was also funny and filled with ""lots of filthy references to what we do in the bedroom.""
""Eighteen years into the relationship, I'm constantly grateful she continues tolerating me,"" the Hearts Beat Loud actor said. ""When I wake up and look over at her, I still think: ""You lucky bastard, you better be on your best behaviour today.""
In an interview with USA Today, Offerman elaborated on why they keep teaming up on projects, saying, ""We love working together. If we drive together, if we share a dressing room, we know going into it that we're going to get along. We're very domestically compatible. People often say to us, 'Are you crazy? I can barely stand my spouse at home every day after work, how can you choose to go to work with her?' And we say, 'Well, that sounds really sad for you, because we just like each other.' ""
During a Halloween appearance on Busy Tonight, Mullally said she believed she and her husband once lived in a house haunted by the spirit of Nicole Brown Simpson, who had been murdered in Los Angeles in 1994. Though Mullally and Offerman didn't live in the same home, their place was on the same property where the house O.J. Simpson had rented for Brown Simpson was located.
""We would have in that house, in one corner of the house, like maybe where the bedroom used to be in the old house, we would have all these sounds and weird things all the time,"" Mullally explained. ""I would be like, 'That's Nicole and she's pissed because Nick doesn't get it.' ""
According to the actress, after Offerman watched documentaries and The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, the spirit's activity stopped. ""Ever since then, no more sounds. She just needed Nick to understand what happened,"" Mullally said.
The Paddle Your Own Canoe author was honored with sexy status in PEOPLE's Sexiest Man Alive 2018 issue. Mullally shared with PEOPLE why he deserved such a title.
""First of all, when I first met him I was really attracted to his kindness and his human decency,"" she said, before joking, ""Now, it's really more about his money — but I still think he's a nice guy.""
The Party Down star didn't leave out his looks either, adding, ""In terms of just raw sexuality, the way that that man maintains his back hair is not to be believed. It is just professional level.""
Though she loves cracking a good joke, she did end her video message with sincerity. ""Bottom line, don't make me pick my favorite quality of one of the world's sexiest men — it's just an embarrassment of riches,"" she said.
That same year, Mullally appeared in PEOPLE's Beautiful Issue, where she shared that Offerman loves it when she goes makeup-free.
""He tells me every minute that I'm the most beautiful, sexy, incredible woman in the world, which couldn't possibly be true, but it's nice,"" she said. ""He always prefers me without makeup, you know, a flannel shirt and a pair of jeans.""
Though Offerman is known for his lumberjack-esque ways, both he and his wife are big fans of The Bachelor. ""I hate to shatter everyone's illusions, but Nick Offerman watches the entire Bachelor franchise with me, including Bachelor in Paradise,"" Mullally said on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2018.
In 2019, they made their dreams come true with a guest appearance during season 23 of the reality show. They asked Colton Underwood's potential loves to share their ""firsts,"" returning the favor by sharing their own innuendo-heavy tales.
Adding to their many collaborative moments, the longtime loves launched a podcast, In Bed with Nick and Megan. Each episode was quite literally recorded from their bed, and they interviewed some of their funniest friends and peers for the show, including Lisa Kudrow, Will Forte and Kathryn Hahn. The podcast lasted for one season, wrapping in September 2020.
The couple hosted the 2022 Independent Spirit Awards in March 2022.
Ahead of the awards show, which honored independent films, the Devs star told The Hollywood Reporter that while neither of them was Billy Crystal (referencing the actor's many Oscars hosting gigs), he and his wife were ""a married couple who loves to be onstage together and lean into our old-fashioned Nichols and May vaudeville back-and-forth … There will also be an overpowering sexuality to the presentation — and there's nothing we can do about that.""
A few days after Offerman starred in the third episode of HBO's The Last of Us, he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live to discuss the role, revealing that he almost turned down the part before Mullally stepped in.
""I didn't have time on the calendar to say 'yes' to this job, and my incredible goddess of a wife read [the script] — and she said 'You're going to Calgary, buddy,' "" he said. ""'Have fun! You have to do this.' ""

Officially titled Joker: Folie à Deux, the upcoming sequel to 2019's Joker will feature several big names, including Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn.
Following the original's success, which included setting worldwide box office records and receiving two Oscar wins, a follow-up film was officially confirmed in June 2022.
Since then, several details have been shared by the cast, including the first look at Gaga's Harley Quinn, which the singer shared on her Instagram.
From the stars to the release date, here's everything to know about Joker: Folie à Deux.
Phoenix reprises his role as Joker alongside Zazie Beetz as Sophie Dumond. In June 2022, PEOPLE confirmed that Lady Gaga was in talks to play Harley Quinn. The Hollywood Reporter was the first to share the news, reporting that Gaga's Harley would exist ""in a different DC universe"" than the one played by Margot Robbie in Suicide Squad (2016), Birds of Prey (2020) and The Suicide Squad (2020).
Other cast members for the film include Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Jacob Lofland and Harry Lawtey, whose roles have not been disclosed.
Todd Phillips, who directed the first film, will helm the upcoming sequel. He is also co-writing the script alongside Scott Silver and producing the film with Bradley Cooper (who, of course, previously starred opposite Gaga in A Star Is Born).
Following Gaga's casting, PEOPLE also confirmed that the upcoming sequel will be a musical. Hildur Guðnadóttir, who worked on the first film, will compose the music for the new film.
Principal photography began in December 2022, with Phillips sharing the first look of Phoenix in character on Instagram. ""Day 1. Our boy. #joker,"" Phillips captioned the image from Dec. 10.
In March 2023, Gaga was spotted filming outside Manhattan's City Hall in N.Y.C. alongside hundreds of extras. Dressed in character as the DC Comics star, Gaga was seen wearing an ensemble composed of a red jacket, a black and white patterned blouse, a black skirt and mesh black leggings as well as red clown-like makeup around her eyes.
On April 5, 2023, Gaga marked the end of filming by sharing a photo of herself in costume with the caption, ""That's a wrap ❤️‍🔥 🎬🃏 X, Harleen."" Phillips also confirmed the end of principal production by posting the same snap of Gaga along with an edgy picture of Phoenix in his Joker makeup and a suit.
Joker: Folie à Deux is scheduled to be released in theaters on Oct. 4, 2024.

Italianx icon Lady Gaga will be starring in Joker: Folie à Deux, the sequel to Todd Phillips’s Oscar-winning film Joker, giving the Joker franchise a guaranteed in with the gay community (next up: Folie à Deux jockstraps). Joaquin Phoenix will be back in the role of Mr. Joker, and the movie will be released October 4, 2024, a date that cannot come fast enough in this household. Gaga has been confirmed to be playing Harley Quinn, though probably not our favorite version (that would be the one in a relationship with Poison Ivy). Still, giving Gaga the opportunity to take something ridiculous seriously always has us going, How great! The film reportedly will be a musical. What we also know, simply based on previous experience, is that the press tour — L. Gaga’s chosen venue for prolonged performance art — will be as fun to watch as the actual film, if not more so.
Speaking of performance art, there’s nothing that screams performance like a holiday filled with grand gestures. Phillips shared the first look of Gaga and Phoenix post-smooch and covered in face paint for a little Valentine’s Day surprise.
But one deux does not make a filmé. Luckily, some other cast members have been confirmed. The original Joker girlie, Zazie Beetz, will be returning for this second film. King of Ireland Brendan Gleeson, Queen of John Malkovich’s Brain Catherine Keener, and Jester of Industry Harry Lawtey are also confirmed to be starring in the upcoming film, according to Variety. We just hope Gleeson is ready to go full Method. Not for the film, of course, but for the media.
And now, a little treat for the girls and the gays. We finally got our first full look at Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn on March 25, and it was worth the wait. Gaga was spotted filming the Joker sequel in New York on Saturday, in full harlequin regalia, including a shiny red blazer and mime makeup — a far cry from Margot Robbie’s pop-punk take on the character.
Sadly, the era in which Lady Gaga’s Joker 2 shoot coincided with Trump’s indictment has ended. Mama Monster posted a farewell to commemorate the wrap of filming on April 5. She signed the post “X, Harleen.” That means we have several whole months without Gaga-as-Harley content before the press tour. Please, please, bring it like you did with House of Gucci, Stefani.

0.3962264150943396,"No surprise from Aronofsky, but we have some questions!
Editor's Note: The following contains spoilers for The WhaleDarren Aronofsky’s The Whale has already proven to be one of the most controversial films of the year, which isn’t all that surprising considering Aronofsky’s history of making divisive projects. While Brendan Fraser has received widespread acclaim for his powerful performance as the overweight professor Charlie, the film has been perceived as “fatphobic” by some critics. It will be interesting to see where The Whale ends up landing this awards season; some view it as emotionally devastating, while others consider it to be manipulative and overtly cruel.
The Whale is based on a play of the same name by Samuel D. Hunter, and Aronofsky’s adaptation does a good job of reflecting the intimacy of a stage performance. The film takes place entirely within Charlie’s apartment as his friend Liz (Hong Chau) comes to care for him. Charlie has managed to isolate himself from the world; he communicates with his students via Zoom but does not ever show his face. Charlie decides to reconnect with his daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), who has no interest in him. Charlie agrees to help write her English papers if she will spend time with him and write personal essays from her heart.
Towards the end of the film, Charlie’s world begins to crumble. After making a series of inflammatory messages to his students, he’s fired from his job. His ex-wife, Mary (Samantha Morton), confronts him about his relationship with Ellie and criticizes him for his failures in their marriage. After being alerted that he has congestive heart failure, Charlie goes on an eating binge and consumes pizza until he vomits. It’s an emotionally overwhelming experience, especially toward the very final moments of the story.
As Charlie reveals early on, he is openly gay and was in a relationship with one of his former students, Alan. Following Alan’s death, Charlie began compulsively eating, prompting Alan’s sister Liz to come and take care of him. As part of their arrangement, Mary forbids Charlie from contacting Ellie; she reacts with rage when she realizes he’s asked her to visit him. While Charlie is apologetic for his failure as a father, he does not apologize for his sexuality. In one of the most powerful scenes in the film, Charlie stands up to the missionary boy Thomas (Ty Simpkins), whose religion preaches homophobic messaging.
As Mary reveals to Charlie, Ellie has been bullying people online through a private Facebook page. Mary feels that she has raised a cruel child and despite how Charlie has hurt the family, Ellie is the true “monster” in their family. In addition to posting pictures of her father, Ellie sends photos of Thomas (a former addict) to his church and family. Despite the seemingly cruel action, Thomas tells Charlie that he has newfound faith in people, as his parents have reached out to forgive him and welcome him home. Thomas also finds a picture of Charlie with Alan and realizes that he only put on the weight as a means of coping with his partner’s suicide.
Even though her father has been ghostwriting her essays so she can graduate, Ellie lashes out at Charlie when she realizes that he sent in an essay that she wrote when she was younger. Charlie feels that the essay is “honest” in a way that he appreciates, as he’s irritated by his students’ generic responses to his questions and prompts. He’s kept the essay for years and uses it to comfort himself. He tells Ellie how beautiful and talented she is, and for the first time, Ellie believes it. Even though Ellie spends the majority of the story mocking other people, she is in denial of her own talents and insecurities.
Throughout the film, Charlie orders pizza online and has the delivery boy, Dan (Sathya Sridharan), leave it outside his door. While Dan tries to spark a conversation with him because he visits Charlie’s apartment so often, Charlie refuses to step outside and show his face. However, Dan decides to wait on the porch when Charlie comes to pick up the pizza and finally sees him for the first time. His immediate response is to look at Charlie in disgust.
Charlie’s ultimate goal is to be completely honest with everyone around him. He refuses to apologize for his homosexuality to Thomas, and chastises him for thinking of him as “disgusting.” He realizes that even though Ellie appears to be cynical, she is really just seeking approval. He even shows his face to his students, and compliments some of the responses that they left in the last message board post that he felt were more honest than their previous work.
Charlie is dying at the very end and refuses to go to the hospital. As he bonds with Ellie, he attempts to stand. Between the effort of moving and his overall mental state, Charlie dies and ascends into an idealized version of heaven. It’s not the first time that Aronofsky has tackled religious imagery within his films. Both Noah and The Fountain directly deal with faith, spirituality, the afterlife, and the stories of the Bible-inspired mother! While Charlie meets his fate, he’s able to feel accomplished and unashamed.
While both the original stage production and the film are very similar, Hunter made some changes to the script when translating it to a feature. Certain elements of the story, such as the Zoom calls and personal photographs, are detailed in a way that wasn’t possible on stage. While the play was released in 2012, the film takes place amidst the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, as news footage can be seen in the background. The endings are the same, but the film is slightly more hopeful, as Charlie feels that he has accomplished something greater.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for The Whale.
It's easy to get swept up in the emotions of Darren Aronofsky's searing drama The Whale, which follows Brendan Fraser as Charlie, a reclusive, 600-pound literature professor struggling, in the last days of his life, to reconnect with the teenage daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), whom he abandoned years prior. The film's conclusion, however, might be more difficult for some viewers to read, so we asked Fraser and screenwriter Samuel D. Hunter to break down what the final scene means for Charlie's journey.
The film slowly builds to a key moment for the father-daughter pair, after Charlie spends most of the movie defending Ellie's sporadic outbursts and prickly, wounded disposition — particularly to his longtime caregiver and friend, Liz (Hong Chau). Charlie maintains that Ellie, like most people, has an innate capacity for empathy, and regularly heralds one of her blunt, years-old school essays criticizing the classic novel Moby Dick. He see it as a signifier of her purity, honesty, and unbridled passion. Still, Ellie remains skeptical of Charlie during most of the film's running time.
""Ellie torments him, when she cases him out the fist time she sees him,"" Fraser observes, noting a specific piece of blocking. ""You notice that she stands behind him. She knows he can't look over his shoulder. She's torturing him a little bit. She's cross, she's angry for the sadness she feels, and that's how this 17-year-old brilliant kid comports herself. She goads him into taking to his feet, knowing well that he likely can't and that it would make him very uncomfortable to do that without even having the assistance of his walker — but she takes it from him anyway and makes him prove himself, and he can't.""
That scene, Fraser says, is key to understanding the film's conclusion, which brings Ellie and Charlie together for a genuine connection, as she reads the essay aloud. Again, Charlie attempts to rise up and walk toward her. That's where things get fantastical, as Fraser calls the final sequence an act of ""contrition"" for Charlie, in which he's ""liberated"" after finally breaking through her defensive armor, reaffirming to Ellie that he sees her for the person she is — and always was.
""It's important because it's a Herculean effort that he makes to even get to his feet,"" Fraser says. ""For him to finally break through to her, humble himself before her, and let her know that he made a mistake and is sorry for it. While his life has not physically ended in that moment, I think that he knows he doesn't need to live any longer, which is why he takes off his breather, he's got her reading the essay, and he does take to his feet like three Olympic dead-lifters, takes his baby steps to his baby, and in that beautiful two-shot, a great white light appears, and they look skyward. Depending on your belief system, spiritually or otherwise, we see that Charlie — with a touch of magic realism — finally does fly.""
Screenwriter Hunter calls the run-up a ""hero journey where he gets the elixir.""
""He's struggling this entire film to put a mirror up to his daughter to say, 'This is who you are,' and in those final moments, that mirror is this essay,"" Hunter explains. ""When she looks at it, she can't deny turning it in and getting a D, but then, here's her father, all these years later, being like, 'This is the best essay I've ever read.' At long last, he's the only person who sees her, and she knows it.""
As for whether Hunter feels Charlie is actually walking in the final shot, he says it's open for interpretation.
""I think it's an apotheosis — you can take it how you want it,"" he says. ""In the play, the way I wrote it is that you hear a sound of waves and they slowly intensify through that scene, so, there's a way to read it both ways. It wants to be miraculous, either literally or figuratively, and I think you can watch it either way.""

0.8,"Johnny Depp is promoting his latest gig.
On Wednesday, the Pirates of the Caribbean actor, 59, teased his spot on Rihanna's Savage X Fenty Vol. 4 fashion show, now available to stream on Prime Video, with an Instagram video.
The reel captures the Golden Globe winner cast in technicolor lights while he stares into the camera. Depp also models sunglasses and a chest-revealing button-down shirt with layers of silver chain necklaces. The post has garnered over one million likes.
""Thank you @badgalriri #SAVAGEFENTYSHOW Vol.4 Out Now @primevideo,"" he wrote.
The short clip offers a glimpse at Depp's mystical segment, for which he models Savage x Fenty loungewear while walking through a misty forest to Outkast's ""So Fresh, So Clean.""
Days before the show, TMZ first reported Depp's cameo appearance, which was later confirmed by PEOPLE.
A source told the former outlet that Rihanna and her team ""invited"" Depp to participate in the show and that both teams were ""excited to make it happen."" As per TMZ, Depp is the ""first male in Savage X Fenty show history to take the role.""
While Depp's fashion spot has acquired excitement and support from fans (including Paris Hilton who commented a fire emoji on his Instagram post), some have spoken out against the debatable collaboration.
Years and Years singer Olly Alexander took to Twitter to express his disappointment in the Grammy singer's brand.
On Nov. 3 he quote-tweeted PopCrave's news, adding an exaggerated sad face. When a fan replied writing, ""But, ""Savage X Fenty"" is you baby....... you wear it so well,"" Alexander wrote back, ""thank you but after this news i won't be wearing it anymore,"" despite his previous work with the brand, including a paid Instagram partnership in February.

In addition to Rihanna's celebrity-filled fashion show, Depp has made various on-screen appearances following his wins in his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard.
In August, he made a surprise appearance at the MTV VMAs with a brief cameo toward the beginning of the show, with his face digitally superimposed into the helmet of a floating moon person. ""And you know what? I needed the work,"" Depp told the crowd during one of his skits.
The appearance came months after a seven-person jury sided mostly with the actor, finding that Heard defamed Depp in her 2018 Washington Post op-ed about domestic violence, though she didn't mention him by name. He was awarded more than $10 million in damages. Heard, meanwhile, won one of her three defamation countersuit claims and was awarded $2 million.
Judge Penney Azcarate denied Heard's request for a mistrial, and after Heard officially appealed the verdict, Depp's legal team announced that they would also be appealing her countersuit verdict. Last week, Depp's lawyers filed paperwork to appeal Heard's $2 million countersuit, calling the verdict ""erroneous.""

0.220754716981132,"It's been two decades since one of Hollywood's most notable love stories first began — that being when Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck first got together.
While the pair initially met back in 2002, their rollercoaster romance has been closely followed for 20 years — from when they first started dating to their rekindled romance in 2021.
The pair initially dated for two years, stirring up a tabloid frenzy with their relationship, but eventually split in 2004. Following their breakup, both Lopez and Affleck pursued other relationships and started families of their own.
Lopez was married to Marc Anthony from 2004 to 2014, and they are parents to twins Max and Emme. Meanwhile, Affleck was married to Jennifer Garner from 2005 to 2018, and they have three kids together, daughters Violet and Seraphina and son Samuel.
In April 2021, Lopez and Affleck were spotted together for the first time in over a decade, sparking relationship rumors. They eventually went public with their rekindled romance and wed in July 2022.
From the beginning of ""Bennifer"" to their second engagement, here's a complete breakdown of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck's relationship.
Lopez and Affleck first met in 2002 on the set of their movie Gigli, which came out the following year. At the time, Lopez was married to her second husband, Cris Judd. The couple eventually divorced in 2003, Lopez and Affleck went public with their romance shortly after.
Lopez told PEOPLE in 2016, ""I really felt like when I met Ben, 'Okay, this is it.""
The duo quickly became one of the biggest couples in Hollywood and one of the first to receive a hybrid couple name: ""Bennifer.""
In a November 2002 interview with Diane Sawyer, Lopez revealed her engagement to Affleck, describing it as ""traditional, but also in a very spectacular way, as of course Ben would do it … it was very, very beautiful.""
PEOPLE reported at the time that Affleck proposed with a custom-made Harry Winston pink-diamond solitaire ring he chose himself.
In her interview with Sawyer, Lopez described her then-fiancé as ""brilliantly smart … Loving. Charming. Affectionate,"" adding that her mother approved.
""And I just admire him in every way,"" she said.
She also acknowledged that some people viewed their relationship as unlikely, but pointed out that she and the actor had bonded over similar upbringings.
""We've talked about this so many times, and we talked about how people kind of see him with … one type of person and me with another type of person, and the two of us together is like, 'How did that happen?'"" she said.
Lopez added, ""And how we're probably more alike and from the same kind of background … same kind of upbringing and same kind of family and same kind of house.""
Heading into 2003, Lopez and Affleck were one of the most popular Hollywood couples to appear in the tabloids and were infamously hounded by the paparazzi.
Lopez even acknowledged their notoriety in the music video for her song ""Jenny from the Block,"" which featured paparazzi shots of herself and Affleck doing everything from pumping gas to lounging on a yacht together.
""We didn't try to have a public relationship,"" Lopez told PEOPLE in 2016. ""We just happened to be together at the birth of the tabloids, and it was like 'Oh my God.' It was just a lot of pressure.""
Lopez told InStyle that the media circus surrounding her relationship with Affleck was ""just crazy.""
""Now at least I can show you who I am a little bit,"" she said. ""Back then you just believed anything you read on the cover of a tabloid. Many times it wasn't true, or it was like a third of the truth.""
In a January 2021 podcast interview, Affleck reflected on how rude media coverage of Lopez was when they were together.
""People were so f---- mean about her — sexist, racist. Ugly, vicious s--- was written about her in ways that if you wrote it now you would literally be fired for saying those things you said,"" he said. ""Now it's like, she's lionized and respected for the work she did, where she came from, what she accomplished — as well she f----- should be! I would say you have a better shot, coming from the Bronx, of ending up as like [Justice Sonia] Sotomayor on the Supreme Court than you do of having Jennifer Lopez's career and being who she is at 50 years old today.""
Lopez and Affleck met on the set of the 2003 rom-com Gigli. Despite their chemistry on-screen, the film bombed at the box office and was panned by critics. PEOPLE called it ""the Stinker of Summer.""
Less than two weeks after the film's release, Affleck admitted on The Tonight Show that the movie ""wasn't good,"" and they ""got buried."" He even poked fun at the film by reading the negative reviews on the late-night show.
Just days before Lopez and Affleck were set to be married in Santa Barbara on Sept. 14, 2003, the couple announced in a statement that they would be postponing their marriage. Lopez and Affleck cited the intense media spotlight as the reason for the postponement.
""Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date,"" Affleck and Lopez said in the statement. ""When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate 'decoy brides' at three different locations, we realized that something was awry.""
""We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends,"" they added.
PEOPLE previously reported that after briefly splitting up in the wake of the canceled wedding, the duo rekindled their relationship, but officially called it quits in January 2004. The intense media attention is largely said to have been a major factor in their breakup.
""Jennifer Lopez has ended her engagement to Ben Affleck. At this difficult time, we ask that you respect her privacy,"" Lopez's rep said at the time, while Affleck's rep added, ""I am not going to confirm anything about his personal life. We don't want to get dragged into quicksand. Everybody wants a war. It's not happening from our side.""
In her interview with PEOPLE in 2016, Lopez said that despite their split, there was ""genuine love"" between herself and Affleck.
""I think different time different thing, who knows what could've happened, but there was a genuine love there,"" she said.
Jersey Girl, the second film starring Lopez and Affleck, was released in March 2004 — two months after the couple split. Filmmaker Kevin Smith, who wrote and directed the movie, would claim years later that he came up with the ""Bennifer"" nickname during the film's production.
Lopez and Affleck remained supportive of one another in the years following their split.
In 2020, Affleck showed his support for Lopez's acting career, saying that she should have been nominated for an Oscar for her role in Hustlers.
""She should have been nominated. She's the real thing,"" Affleck told New York Times reporter Brooks Barnes. ""I keep in touch periodically with her and have a lot of respect for her. How awesome is it that she had her biggest hit movie at 50? That's f—— baller.""
Following Lopez's split from Alex Rodriguez in April 2021, the singer began spending time with Affleck in L.A.
""They are friends. They have always been friends and they have seen each other through the years,"" a source told PEOPLE.
Another source told PEOPLE, ""They have a great time hanging out. ... It's been years since they caught up properly. They have lots to talk about. They plan on hanging out again.""
Less than a week later, the two were spotted in Montana together. Sources told PEOPLE they were pictured riding in a car together near a resort in Big Sky, where Affleck has a home.
""[Jennifer] spent several days with Ben out of town. They have a strong connection. It's all been quick and intense, but Jennifer is happy,"" a source told PEOPLE.
In July 2021, Lopez posted a carousel of photos on Instagram in honor of her 52nd birthday. Grouped in the mix of bikini and boat pictures, the final photo in the roundup showed Lopez and Affleck kissing.
This marked the first time the couple personally posted about each other on social media.
At the Venice Film Festival in September 2021, the duo made returned to the red carpet for the first time since reuniting. It was a big night for the two, but especially for Affleck as it was the premiere of his film, The Last Duel.
Affleck and Lopez channeled Old Hollywood vibes as they strutted the carpet alongside each other in glamorous looks. Affleck donned a classic black tux, while Lopez wore a white mermaid-style gown, accentuated with a string of Swarovski crystal embellishments and accompanied by Cariter diamonds.
The couple marked another major milestone later that month when they attended their first Met Gala together on Sept. 13 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala. Not only did Affleck and Lopez stun in Ralph Lauren, but they shared a passionate kiss through their masks.
The couple stepped out in style yet again for the premiere of The Last Duel in New York City on Oct. 9, 2021. Held at Lincoln Center, Lopez and Affleck's infatuation with each other was crystal clear as the two couldn't help but smile wide at each other while they posed for pictures.
Lopez and Affleck kept the red carpet circuit going into the new year, as they appeared at the Marry Me premiere in Los Angeles on Feb. 8, 2022. The singer, who stars in the film, went dressed in all white as a playful nod to the movie's romantic theme.
Lopez chatted with PEOPLE for the 2022 Love Issue, opening up about the loves in her life — ranging from her kids to her rekindled relationship with Affleck.
""I feel so lucky and happy and proud to be with him,"" Lopez said of her rekindled romance with Affleck, adding, ""It's a beautiful love story that we got a second chance.""
As Lopez accepted the Icon Award at the 2022 iHeartRadio Music Awards on March 22, Affleck smiled proudly from the audience with son Samuel, 10, and Lopez's daughter Emme, 14, by his side.
Samuel and Emme stood on opposite sides of the actor and also cheered for Lopez with a standing ovation. The sweet moment of the three was captured by iHeartRadio on Twitter, writing, ""You know #BenAffleck had to show up and support @JLo.""
Congratulations! The pair got engaged in April 2022, a rep for Lopez confirmed to PEOPLE. Lopez shared the news in her On the JLo newsletter after she was photographed wearing what appeared to be an engagement ring earlier in the month.
She revealed the exciting update in an April 8 email to her inner circle. The message to fans included a clip of Lopez admiring a huge, green diamond on her ring finger, an image of which was also shared by her sister on social media.
Lopez teased the ""major announcement"" with a video on Twitter that same night. ""So I have a really exciting and special story to share..."" Lopez told her followers. She also added a diamond ring emoji to her Twitter handle.
The newly-engaged Lopez and Affleck were spotted walking hand-in-hand at the Brentwood Country Mart in the Brentwood neighborhood of L.A.
Affleck is father to three children with ex-wife Jennifer Garner and is also close with Lopez's two children with ex-husband Marc Anthony. Lopez celebrated those relationships on Father's Day with an Instagram post honoring Affleck.
Along with a video post featuring a montage of clips of the couple together, Lopez shared the caption, ""Happy Father's Day to the most caring, loving, affectionate, consistent and selfless Daddy ever.""
From Marry Me to married! On July 17, Lopez confirmed in her On The JLo newsletter that she and Affleck wed in Las Vegas the night prior. In her post, she detailed the ""best night ever"" and indicated that the couple's children were ""the best witnesses.""
""It's a beautiful outcome that this has happened in this way at this time in our lives where we can really appreciate and celebrate each other and respect each other,"" continued Lopez. ""We always did, but we have even more of an appreciation because we know that life can take you in different directions.""
She added, ""We have been in the game in the public eye long enough to know who we are as people and what really matters and what doesn't matter. We have kids and we respect each other. ... We really live our lives in a way we can be proud of and our kids can be proud of you. We're just operating from a place of love and respect for everyone in our lives and that is very important to us. We know what the truth is [and] we hold it sacred.""
Following their nuptials, the newlyweds enjoyed a post-wedding vacation in Paris, where they enjoyed trips to Louvre and cruises on the River Seine.
A source told PEOPLE that Lopez and Affleck ""have an extraordinary weekend of celebrations planned"" for guests attending their wedding celebration in Georgia.
""They will have a pre-wedding party, a ceremony and have lots of fun lined up,"" the insider said of the romantic celebration, adding that Lopez ""is ecstatic"" about the plans.
The source also said Lopez's mom and sister are already in Georgia and the couple's kids will be part of the celebrations. ""It will be a beautiful weekend,"" they added.
A month after marrying in Las Vegas, Affleck and Lopez celebrated their nuptials with a ceremony in Georgia in front of friends and family.
Celebrities including Matt Damon, Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes and top Hollywood talent agent Patrick Whitesell attended the star-studded event, which took place on the grounds of Affleck's 87-acre compound outside Savannah. Podcaster and life coach Jay Shetty officiated the ceremony.
Lopez looked regal in a white Ralph Lauren gown with cap sleeves, an open-back cutout and a flowing train with ruffle detailing. A sheer cathedral-length veil completed the stunning bridal look. Meanwhile, Affleck looked dapper in a white tuxedo jacket with black trousers and a classic bowtie.
Guests were photographed wearing all-white, but left the ceremony with a new accessory — the couple sent each attendee home with a straw gift bag featuring their monogrammed initials.
Lopez and Affleck set out for a romantic Italian getaway after their Georgia wedding ceremony.
The pair were seen enjoying a romantic dinner at a historic hotel on Lake Como, Italy. A source who spotted the pair at the restaurant told PEOPLE, ""They were attentive only to each other, didn't have eyes for anything else.""
The insider added, ""They seemed to very much enjoy the evening, as they arrived when the sun was still high and stayed on well after dark.""
The next day, the newlyweds had a low-key visit to the lakeside town of Menaggio. ""They just queued up for ice cream like everyone else, and wandered into shops. They acted normally, even if they had bodyguards with them,"" another source said.
Later, Lopez and Affleck were spotted shopping in Milan. The couple were ""walking around, mingling, walking in and out of shops and of course [giving] lots of loving attention to each other,"" another insider said. ""Every day, they are more in love.""
The pair also made time to pose with fans outside one shop, with a different source telling PEOPLE, ""They were very kind and available with all their fans.""
Lopez shared details from her dreamy Georgia wedding ceremony, along with professional photos, in her newsletter. The singer wrote about her big day, including the moment she walked down the ""aisle that would lead me toward the rest of my life.""
""When he saw me appear at the top of the stairs that moment it both made absolute sense while seeming still impossibly hard to believe, like the best dream, where all you want is never to awaken,"" Lopez wrote. ""I would have had many of the same thoughts probably had I not been focusing so hard on not tripping over my dress, but when I got close enough to see his face, it made the same wonderful sense to me.""
""Some old wounds were healed that day and the weight of the past finally lifted off our shoulders,"" Lopez continued. ""Full-circle — and not at all the way we planned it. Better.""
Lopez also showed off snaps from the celebration, including one of the newlyweds walking up the aisle together, a photo of the duo holding each other under a sign that says ""Mr. and Mrs. Affleck"" and a romantic picture of the two leaning in for a kiss.
Lopez and Affleck were seen in matching all-black ensembles at a Ralph Lauren show in Southern California. Lopez was photographed in a sleek pinstripe dress and a classic black fedora while Affleck wore a black suit with a matching black tie and button-up. During the event, the newlyweds were photographed holding hands and looking affectionately into each other's eyes.
Lopez shared pictures of herself on Instagram wearing a delicate diamond necklace featuring the letters ""Mrs."" as a nod to her recent marriage to Affleck. Along with the necklace, the actress wore a black lacy bra with black silk pajamas. ""I've Been Thinkin' … comfy cozy writing session today📓"" she captioned the carousel post.
Lopez revealed that she changed her last name after marrying Affleck during an interview with Vogue. She explained that ""people are still going to call me Jennifer Lopez,"" but her legal name ""will be Mrs. Affleck because we're joined together.""
""We're husband and wife. I'm proud of that. I don't think that's a problem,"" the actress added. She then laughed when asked whether she'd ever want Affleck to take her last name. As she explained, ""No! It's not traditional. It doesn't have any romance to it.""
""It feels like it's a power move, you know what I mean?"" Lopez continued. ""I'm very much in control of my own life and destiny and feel empowered as a woman and as a person."" The newlywed noted that she ""can understand that people have their feelings about"" her name preference, ""and that's okay, too.""
""But if you want to know how I feel about it, I just feel like it's romantic,"" she said. ""It still carries tradition and romance to me, and maybe I'm just that kind of girl.""
While chatting with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, Lopez opened up about her and Affleck's breakup in 2004.
""It was so painful after we broke up,"" she said. ""Once we called off that wedding 20 years ago, it was the biggest heartbreak of my life. I honestly felt like I was going to die. It sent me on a spiral for the next 18 years where I just couldn't get it right. But now, 20 years later, it does have a happy ending. It has the most would-never-happen-in-Hollywood ending.""
The singer went on to talk about her new album, This is Me...Now, which she hopes will inspire others not to give up on love.
""True love does exist and some things do last forever and that's real. I want to put that message out into the world and that does take a lot of vulnerability,"" Lopez said, adding that Affleck ""loves"" the album. ""He's my biggest fan, which is awesome, and supporter. When he came back into my life again, the same thing happened where I felt so inspired and so overtaken with emotion that it was just pouring out of me.""
During one of Vogue's signature ""73 Questions"" interviews, Joe Sabia asked Lopez about her career in film and television, at one point asking which project she would want to make a sequel to.
""Gigli,"" she said with a smile.
He then asked, ""Who has made you laugh the most between takes?"" to which she replied, ""My husband, Ben.""
Celebrities including Doja Cat, Kim Kardashian, Billie Eilish and Eric André attended Lopez and Affleck's holiday bash at their L.A. home.
Lopez wore a festive gold dress to the party, while Affleck donned a longline peacoat over a black sweater. In video clips posted on Instagram, the couple could be seen standing by the piano for sing-alongs to ""Jingle Bells"" and John Legend's ""By Christmas Eve.""
Lopez talked about living with Affleck during an appearance on Today. ""We moved in together, the kids moved in together, so it's been like a really kind of emotional transition,"" the actress said. ""But at the same time … all your dreams coming true, it's just been a phenomenal year.""
Of 2022, she said, ""Best year, I think, since my kids were born.""
Lopez made a surprise appearance at the 65th annual Grammy Awards on Feb. 5, glittering in Gucci while handing out the best pop vocal album to winner Harry Styles. Following her award presentation, she headed back to her table where she joined husband Affleck, who gave her a sweet kiss when she was done with her stage moment.
Affleck made headlines for looking painfully bored at the award show. Memes popped up all over the internet — and Lopez got in on the fun. She shared a photo of a solemn-looking Affleck from his new movie, AIR, in which he plays Nike, Inc. co-founder, Philip Knight.
""My husband's happy face,"" she captioned the image on Instagram.
Affleck made his love for Dunkin' official when he starred in a Super Bowl commercial for the coffee company, which aired during the first commercial break of the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.
In the ad, Affleck played a Dunkin' employee serving unsuspecting attendees their beverages and treats in a hidden camera-like spot. At one point, while he is working the drive-thru, Jennifer Lopez appeared and teased her husband. ""What are you doing? Is that what you do when you say you're going to work all day?"" she said.
Lopez revealed in an Instagram post that she and Affleck got romantic couple tattoos. In one photo, the actress could be seen taking a mirror selfie to show off her new ink, which sits on her ribcage. The tattoo includes an infinity sign with an arrow as well as what appears to be ""Jennifer"" and ""Ben"" written in cursive.
Lopez also shared a photo of her husband's tattoo, which has two arrows crossing one another. It features the letter ""J"" above the crossed arrows and the letter ""B"" below.
""Commitment ♾️,"" the Shotgun Wedding star wrote in the caption. ""Happy Valentine's Day my love 🤍.""
Affleck plays the co-founder of Nike in his upcoming film Air. Ahead of filming, he leaned on Lopez to educate him about fashion.
""Oh, my God, she's brilliant,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter. ""She is incredibly knowledgeable about the way fashion evolves through the culture as a confluence of music, sports, entertainment and dance.""
Affleck was the bearer of bad news on The Drew Barrymore Show.
""Let me tell you something that's gonna upset you,"" Affleck said. ""Jennifer just eats whatever she wants. Whatever she wants. She eats cookies, ice cream, everything. She works out. I work out too, but I don't magically appear to be 20 years old, you know what I mean, with perfect skin and the whole thing.""
He continued: ""There's no taking away from the work ethic. The work ethic is real, the discipline is real, but also the superhuman thing is real. She's the most gorgeous woman in the world, she looks spectacular.""
The Air actor went on to share what he thinks Lopez would change about him.
""She would probably want to cultivate brevity in the way I speak,"" he said. ""I don't know if you've noticed, but I go on and on and on. I talk in circles. She's never said that to me, but that would be my guess.""
Lopez spoke about Affleck and their blended family during an appearance on Today. ""Well, he's a wonderful, wonderful father,"" the actress and singer said of her husband. ""And a father figure to [Max and Emme] as well, because he has his own three beautiful children, and then there's us.""
""And they love him. They love him. And they appreciate him, and so do I,"" she added.
Lopez joined Affleck at the L.A. premiere of The Flash, where the pair were photographed kissing and giggling on the red carpet.
For the outing, Lopez stunned in a Gucci floor-length gown, which featured a black bodice and peach skirt. Meanwhile, Affleck wore a black suit and shirt.
The couple celebrated their first wedding anniversary with a romantic dinner at Giorgio Baldi in Los Angeles. Lopez wowed in a white minidress, while Affleck looked handsome in an all-black ensemble.
A day later, the singer teased a new song titled ""Midnight Trip to Vegas."" The track pays tribute to the couple's decision to get hitched in Sin City.
The couple walked the red carpet together at the LACMA Art + Film Gala. Lopez dazzled in a champagne-colored Gucci gown, while Affleck looked handsome in a tuxedo.
A source close to the couple told PEOPLE that Affleck was ""proud"" of his wife as she prepared to release her ninth album on Feb. 16, 2024.
“Ben’s proud of her. He’s her biggest fan. He loves how hard-working and focused she is,"" the source said. ""Their family life is great too. The kids are all friends. They get along really well.""

Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez rekindled Bennifer over a week in Montana this May, now that the stars have realigned and they’re both single at the same time … again. Over less than two years, from 2002 to 2004, their glamorous romance fueled early-tabloid culture, set the standard for ship names, then fizzled out faster than it began. Within a year, they were married to Jennifer Garner and Marc Anthony, respectively, occupying celebrity news with other people. Now, they’re back to their old Y2K ways. Their 2021 reunion has inspired endless gossip (bless the “sources”), not to mention several essays devoted to our nearly two-decade-long cultural obsession with this perfectly odd couple. Sorry to everything Ben Affleck stands for, but no film could begin to encompass the daily drama (and hilarity) of his real life. Catch up on Bennifer with this timeline of their relationship across the ages.
Early 2002: Pop star Jennifer Lopez and Hollywood golden boy Ben Affleck meet on the set of Gigli while Lopez is married to her second husband, Cris Judd. Where else does Ben Affleck meet any of his girlfriends at this point? Raya doesn’t exist yet.
Vulture’s weekly newsletter of the best TV and movie recommendations.
July 24, 2002: “Co-stars” and “friends” Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are seen kissing and cuddling at a surprise-birthday party for the Leo superstar, one of the first events marking the start of their relationship with the tabloids.
July 26, 2002: J.Lo files for divorce from husband No. 2 after a month of separation (but that’s a story for a prequel timeline).
November 5, 2002: MTV’s TRL premieres the music video for “Jenny From the Block,” a Y2K mood board starring Bennifer, combining J.Lo’s roots with her new movie-star lifestyle. Ben famously leans over and kisses her butt while they sun on a yacht (yes, this relationship explains his early 2000s tan), and nobody here can blame him, really.
While kissing a booty long-rumored to be worthy of a $27 million insurance policy is on many of our bucket lists, in 2008, Affleck said the music video was his “big regret” of the relationship. See, the song is a megabop asserting J.Lo’s street cred, but the video itself is about the public’s obsession with the couple, told through the literal lens of the paparazzi following them from lunch to the yacht to the gas station and home, hoping to catch intimate moments between Jenny from the block and Boston’s hometown hero. But worshipping J.Lo’s backside was a performance choice all his own. The video went early-2000s viral, so ultimately, exposing themselves to comment on their overexposure backfired. And we’re left with a grim yet sexy prediction of their hyperpublic downfall that even J.Lo tried to get removed from MTV and VH1 in 2004.
November 2002: By November, they’re engaged. Within months of her separation, Ben proposed to Jen at his mother’s house in Boston. “It’s just a blanket, a quilt of rose petals, all over the whole entire house,” Lopez remembered in an ABC exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer, announcing their engagement. “So many candles, and vases, bouquets. And my song ‘Glad’ was playing … I walk in and I was just, like, overwhelmed. I wasn’t expecting it, and I was just like, ‘Oh my God.’” The ring, a pink diamond the size of Affleck’s head, would go down in pop-culture monogamy history.
March 2003: Affleck denies any notion that he acted on his feelings before J.Lo and Judd separated. “That is absolutely not true,” he tells Vanity Fair. “It goes against the fundamental code I believe in and live by: being honest, doing things with which I can live, rather than be ashamed of — doing esteemable things.” The couple never officially says when they got together, but they do emphasize their innocence.
July 17, 2003: Affleck reportedly pays a visit to a strip club in Vancouver, where he was recording Paycheck, hours after their intimate Dateline interview aired. The National Enquirer claimed he cheated on her with at least one woman and that the encounter might be on tape. Shortly after, reports start to suggest Lopez has stopped wearing her million-dollar ring. “What they put in the paper is not what happened, so it doesn’t matter,” she would tell W magazine later that summer, in an interview that came out in October. “But watching that get so blown out of proportion, I was like, Wow, so this is where we’re at: You can’t walk into a place and hang out with a couple of friends without it turning into a national scandal.” Ben himself denied cheating via a spokesperson and reportedly considered suing the Enquirer.
August 1, 2003: Gigli is dead on arrival — a box-office and critical bomb, with a worldwide gross of $7.7 million against a $75.6 million budget — and so are the vibes between the supposed “It” couple at the premiere, fueling suspicions that the romance is dying down.
September 13, 2003: The day before the highly anticipated nuptials — America’s version of a royal wedding before Kim Kardashian made it a regular occurrence — Bennifer releases a joint statement via a spokesperson postponing the wedding.
Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date. When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate ‘decoy brides’ at three different locations, we realised that something was awry. We began to feel that the spirit of what should have been the happiest day of our lives could be compromised. We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families, and our friends.
September 14, 2003: A wedding for 400 in Santa Barbara, California, does not happen in spite of reports.
January 23, 2004: “Dumped,” reads the headline from the Chicago Tribune. Jennifer Lopez officially ends the discourse (and her relationship) in a statement to the Associated Press. “I am confirming the reports that Jennifer Lopez has ended her engagement to Ben Affleck,” a rep states. “At this difficult time, we ask that you respect her privacy.” That did not happen.
March 26, 2004: Jersey Girl, Bennifer’s second try at being a movie-star couple, directed by Kevin Smith, the man who now claims he gave them the nickname “Bennifer,” premieres. Though it’s mostly remembered for crashing and burning as hard as the relationship had, I can’t be the only 2000s kid straight-up traumatized by Gertie (Lopez) dying during childbirth??? And then they ask why millennials aren’t having babies.
March 9, 2019: After dating for two years, former Yankee Alex Rodriguez proposes to J.Lo with the kind of ring that has something to prove (because it does), and the world begins to anticipate another J.Lo–sized royal wedding. Yes, we have Meghan Markle now, but let’s be honest, her wedding was modest compared to what J.Lo could cook up.
March 8, 2020: Deep Water stars Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas take a trip to her home country, Cuba. When they get back, they quarantine and perform for paparazzi together in Los Angeles, confirming their romance.
December 2020: Lopez talks about having to postpone the wedding twice during the coronavirus pandemic on Access Hollywood. “There’s no rush, we’re good, everything’s cool and it’ll happen when the time is right,” she says without an ounce of fear.
January 18, 2021: The pandemic does not end, but BenAna does. Two days later, J-Rod attend the Biden-Harris inauguration and any marital strife is drowned out by J.Lo’s most patriotic “Let’s Get Loud” yet.
March 12, 2021: Sources tell “Page Six” that A-Rod and J.Lo have split up.
April 5, 2021: In an InStyle cover honoring J.Lo with praise from her friends and collaborators, both Marc Anthony and Ben Affleck call her the hardest worker they know while A-Rod isn’t quoted.
May 2, 2021: Ben and Jen spend the week in Montana, arriving back in L.A. on Saturday, May 8, sources tell anyone who would listen. “It’s natural between them, and the chemistry is unreal,” a J.Lo source told E!, also confirming that he reached out to her. “They picked up where they last left off and are enjoying each other’s company right now.” Aren’t we all?
May 19, 2021: “Jennifer is still very excited about how things are going,” an insider tells People, adding that Bennifer are “making plans to see each other” and are “in touch every day” while Lopez returns to Miami. And the cycle restarts!
May 23, 2021: Per TMZ, Ben Affleck arrives in Miami wearing several layers too many and is later seen smoking a cigarette on the balcony at the same waterfront mansion as J.Lo. On his wrist appears to be the watch he wore in “Jenny From the Block” way back when. Is this an Easter egg just for us?
Meanwhile, A-Rod is stepping “into a new beginning,” according to an new Instagram Story. “I am remaining patient and know that this new phase of my life is coming,” he posts. It’s a new dawn, a new day, and Bennifer is feeling good.
May 24, 2021: Ben and Jen both worked out at a Miami Beach gym on Monday, sharing a kiss in between separate private sessions, per In Touch. Apparently, no gym bros caught it in the background of their mirror selfies. Rude!
June 13, 2021: After weeks of the world clinking their spoons to their glasses, they kissed! And what happens at Nobu, ends up in “Page Six.” Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck were photographed kissing again for the first time on Sunday at a function for her sister’s 50th birthday, sources say. In footage from the event, J.Lo’s 13-year-old twins, Max and Emme, could also be seen. According to People spies, Ben and J.Lo held hands under the table as well. “Ben and her kids seemed comfortable together,” the source told People. “The kids kept chatting with Ben. Ben seemed great. He was smiling and laughing. They ordered a lot of food to share. Ben had a Diet Coke.” Just like 20 years ago, Bennifer is going full speed.
July 24, 2021: Feliz Cumpleaños to the unaging Jennifer Lopez. She celebrated it just like she spent her b-day in 2002: by “kissing” Ben Affleck. The 52-year-old posted a slideshow of photos to Instagram, including one where she and Affleck are kissing. Bennifer is Instagram official, and it only took 19 years and the creation of the app.
July 25, 2021: And what would Bennifer 2 be without an encore ass rub? Y’all went online and begged for the sequel, so don’t be mad when they throw in a little fan service. Ben Affleck was once again snapped giving J.Lo’s ass a touch on a yacht in Monaco (not far from ex A-Rod), recreating a scene from the 2002 “Jenny From the Block” music video inadvertently or not. The on-the-nose ass grab seems to reveal a cog in the celebrity machine, shamelessly relying on nostalgia and boredom to stay relevant. If Bennifer 2.0 is just an act, at least they’re hitting their cues.
July 26, 2021: J.Lo wears a “Ben” necklace, in case it wasn’t clear. Almost wish Affleck started wearing a “Jen” necklace, just to confuse the tabloids.
September 10, 2021: Affleck and J.Lo end their summer of love at Venice Film Festival, making waves in the water taxis, on a balcony, and, finally, on their first red carpet since reuniting. Nineteen years since they first appeared as a couple at the Maid in Manhattan premiere, the couple arrived together for the premiere of Affleck’s The Last Duel and assumed those familiar positions on the red carpet, gazing deeply at one another and sharing kisses like we’re not watching. Cameras flashed, time folded in on itself. Lopez comes directly for Oscar Isaac’s viral red-carpet flirtation earlier this fest with intense eye contact and the raw sexual magnitude of a nude lip. If this is Bennifer acting, it’s better than any movie either of them have been in.
September 13, 2021: Thanks to Lopez and Affleck,  making out with masks on is now Met Gala behavior.
March 21, 2022: Bennifer reportedly become homeowners together. Things have been a little quite on the Bennifer front — while promoting her movie Marry Me, J.Lo said she was “trying not say too much” about her rekindled relationship. But rest assured that the couple is still going strong, to the tune of a $50 million mansion in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.
April 8, 2022: Lopez announces via her On the J.Lo newsletter that she has gotten engaged to Affleck. In a short video, she tearfully looks at the giant green ring on her finger. The clip was set to the sound of her whispering “You’re perfect” in her song “Dear Ben,” which was released in the first year of their relationship. That’s what we call a full-circle moment, folks.
July 17, 2022: They did it, folks. Nineteen years after they chose not to get married the day before the wedding, Bennifer are married, and J.Lo announces it in her newsletter. This time, though, they did it “in a drive through in Las Vegas at twelve thirty in the morning” with kids, a far cry from the festivities of their first intended wedding. She notably signs the letter from “Jennifer Lynn Affleck,” so move over J.Lo, J.Aff is in the building. “In the end it was the best possible wedding we could have imagined,” writes J.Aff. “One we dreamed of long ago and one made real (in the eyes of the state, Las Vegas, a pink convertible, and one another) at very, very long last.” We hope the happy couple got Dunkin’ Donuts on the way home.

The two shirts worn by the longtime friends featured a set of six keys around the words, symbolizing the final moment of the series in which all six friends left behind their keys when Monica and Chandler (Matthew Perry) moved out of their apartment.
""Friends forever ❤️link in bio 👩🏼‍🤝‍👩🏻@americares @ebmrf,"" Aniston and Cox captioned the joint Instagram post.
Friends ran for 10 seasons on NBC from 1994 to 2004. Aniston (Rachel Green), Cox (Monica Geller), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe Buffay), Matt LeBlanc (Joey Tribbiani), Perry (Chandler Bing) and David Schwimmer (Ross Geller) all got back together for the HBO Max special, Friends: The Reunion, last year.
During the special, which premiered in May 2021, the stars revealed a number of behind-the-scenes tidbits from their time on the show. They also reminisced about being a part of the hit series.
""It was an incredible time,"" Cox told her costars during the unscripted special. ""Everything came together. We became best friends through just the chemistry, the whole thing. It was life-changing and it forever will be - not just for us, but for people who watch it, and that's such a great feeling to carry forever. I'm really thankful, and I love you guys so much.""

In honor of Lisa's 59th birthday, the two took to their Instagram Stories to pay tribute to their former Friends co-star.
On July 30, over a series of posts, Jennifer, 53, shared a throwback pic of the besties from the 2003 People's Choice Awards as well as a GIF of their Friends characters jumping up and down and clapping with the message, ""I Love You."" She also included a recent selfie of herself kissing Lisa on the cheek, captioned with three emojis: a red heart, birthday cake and kissy face.
Courteney, 58, also shared a video of herself and Lisa laughing together on her Instagram Stories. ""Happy Birthday loot,"" she wrote with the clip. ""You make everything better. And funnier!""
Jennifer, Lisa and Courteney played BFFs Rachel Green, Phoebe Buffay and Monica Gellar on the NBC's hit sitcom for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004. Nearly three decades later, the trio remain ultra tight IRL and even maintain a group text.

0.2307692307692307,"""It was just one gut-punch after the other, and mentally and physically I deteriorated pretty bad,"" says Harrison in the debut episode of The Most Dramatic Podcast... Ever With Chris Harrison.
Chris Harrison was so devastated by his unexpected exit from the Bachelor franchise, it took a major toll on his physical health.
""I lost 20 pounds. I didn't sleep, I didn't eat,"" said Harrison. ""It was just one gut punch after the other, and mentally and physically I deteriorated pretty bad.""
The former Bachelor Nation host and relationship guru broke his silence in the debut of The Most Dramatic Podcast... Ever, which dropped today. Speaking for nearly two hours from his home office in Austin, Harrison talked openly about his departure from the franchise after what he called his ""infamous"" interview with EXTRA correspondent and former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay.
""I was heartbroken. I was gutted,"" he said. ""I was embarrassed. I was mad at myself. I was disappointed in myself. The last thing in the world I ever wanted to do was be an agent of anything negative — whether it had to do with race or anything."" At the height of the backlash, added the host, he and fiancée Lauren Zima had paparazzi camped outside their house, and he had to take evasive measures to go anywhere. ""There were people parked outside of my house for weeks, following me everywhere we went,"" he said. ""I would sneak down the hill of my house through my neighbor's backyard and my buddy would pick me up.""
Harrison said he was shocked that the backlash from the interview — in which he defended Bachelor season 25 contestant Rachael Kirkconnell for attending a ""plantation-themed"" sorority party in college — continued to rage even after he apologized. The host believes the reaction is due in part to the ""very combustible moment in time"" America was experiencing in early 2021, due both to the COVID pandemic as well as an ongoing reckoning about police brutality and racism in the wake of George Floyd's murder.
""My apology was warranted. I had no problem putting out that first apology... But there was just so much noise at the time, it just didn't matter. Apologies didn't matter,"" he said. ""Even after that apology, we were still at ground zero. It was confusing and it was scary.""
Harrison added that he was dismayed to find himself being ""used"" as a symbol by both sides of the political debate. ""My name became synonymous with this political, lightning-in-a-bottle moment, and all of a sudden someone on CNN is talking about me for purposes of the left,"" he recalled. ""And then Ben Shapiro and whoever else is talking about me... so I was being used by the right.""
He also noted that he was aware of ""certain cast members"" who were campaigning to take his job in the weeks after the interview — though he said other cast members, including Ben Higgins, Catherine and Sean Lowe, and Jake Pavelka reached out to offer support during his ""ordeal.""
In terms of the decision to leave the long-running ABC series, Harrison said he eventually hit a ""breaking point"" and determined that he needed to ""step away and get my life back."" The 51-year-old TV veteran added that he ""will forever be grateful"" to the Bachelor franchise and that he holds ""no animosity"" toward the team behind the show. That said, Harrison told listeners that he hasn't watched any Bachelor series since Matt James' season, which was the last one he hosted.

On the first two episodes of his new podcast The Most Dramatic Podcast Ever with Chris Harrison, the 51-year-old television personality addressed the fallout from his ""infamous"" February 2021 interview with former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay.
""I was heartbroken. I was gutted. I was embarrassed. I was mad at myself,"" he admitted. ""I was disappointed in myself. The last thing in the world I ever wanted to do was be an agent of anything negative — whether it had to do with race or anything.""
The former host of The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelorette in Paradise also revealed the personal toll the controversy took on him after hosting the ABC franchise for two decades.
""Things spun out of control for a number of reasons and I was sick, sick to my stomach,"" he explained. ""I lost 20 pounds. I didn't sleep. I didn't eat. I was scared to death… It was just one gut-punch after the other, and mentally and physically I deteriorated pretty bad.""
Harrison admitted that during the interview, he was not his ""normal, eloquent self.""
""I didn't express myself like I normally do. I think that part we all agree on,"" he shared. ""But as far as my standing in the community and the show, it really didn't register on the Richter scale. There was much more egregious things going on in the world and things that had happened.""
However, the former host said that his ""apology was warranted because I did misstep and I made a mistake.""
During the fallout, Harrison recalled ""certain cast members"" campaigning to take over his hosting duties while others — including Ben Higgins, Ashley Iaconetti, and Catherine and Sean Lowe — reached out to him personally to offer their support.
He also gave a shout out to BiP bartender Wells Adams for reaching out amid the controversy.
""Wells was in a very difficult situation because obviously he was still kind of connected to the show and he was doing stuff on Paradise, but he was one of the first to reach out to me and just say, 'Look, I'm staying out of this. I love you and respect you,'"" he said. ""I appreciated that, and I appreciate him, because if anybody had sights on the job it easily was Wells, and deservedly so by the way.""
Harrison believed that Adams ""was going to get the job"" before Jesse Palmer was named the new host.
""I thought that was kind of the easiest call since Ken Jennings got the Jeopardy job. He's in the family. Everyone loves him. It just seemed like a layup, but that's not how it went down,"" he explained. ""I even told him, 'Man, I won't speak out publicly, because I don't think that would help you at all. In fact it would probably do a lot more harm than good, but I really hope you get the job. I think you'd be great at it.'""
Harrison's June 2021 departure from the hit franchise came months after a controversy in which former contestant Lindsay — the franchise's first Black Bachelorette — called him out for defending another former cast member's past racist behavior.
Lindsay spoke out against Harrison after he seemingly defended contestant Rachael Kirkconnell during a 14-minute, unedited interview with Lindsay on Extra for past social media posts in which she dressed in Native American attire as a costume and attended an Antebellum plantation-themed ball. She later apologized, admitting that her ""ignorance was racist"" and that ""I was wrong.""
In a statement at the time, Harrison also apologized for ""wrongly speaking in a manner that perpetuates racism.""
In confirming news of his departure four months later, Harrison alluded to future endeavors.
""I've had a truly incredible run as host of The Bachelor franchise and now I'm excited to start a new chapter,"" he wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post. ""I'm so grateful to Bachelor Nation for all of the memories we've made together. While my two-decade journey is wrapping up, the friendships I've made will last a lifetime.""

0.6,"“Transparent” actress Trace Lysette has no regrets about accusing former co-star Jeffrey Tambor of sexual harassment.
Tambor was eventually fired from “Transparent” following harassment allegations made by his former assistant on the show, Van Barnes, who accused Tambor of subjecting her to unwanted physical contact and lewd remarks. But Tambor’s career is still alive; he has a starring role on Netflix’s “Arrested Development” reboot. Lysette wasn’t surprised Tambor seemed to take a softer hit compared to other industry heavyweights singled out in the #MeToo movement, since she, Barnes, and most of his accusers are transgender women.
Another of Tambor’s trans accusers, Alexandra Billings, who plays Davina on “Transparent,” also weighed in on Tambor’s consequences — or lack thereof — and what his reckoning means for the Hollywood transgender community.
But ultimately, Billings feels grateful for her experiences with Tambor, insofar as they propelled her and others to speak out against injustice.
While Tambor’s character, Maura Pfefferman, will never again appear on Amazon’s comedy series, Billings and Lysette will both return for the show’s fifth season later this year.

Allegations that he sexually harassed trans actresses Van Barnes and Trace Lysette were all part of a coup to oust him from the Amazon show, Tambor says. The actor repeated admissions that he was rude and temperamental on set because he was so obsessed with playing his Transparent character Maura to the best of his ability. “Lines got blurred. I was difficult. I was mean. I yelled at Jill — she told me recently she was afraid of me,” Tambor said — but he denied allegations that he spied on Barnes while naked or touched either actress inappropriately.
After reading Faith’s email, Tambor begin to suspect the allegations against him had an agenda, he told THR: “The message sent a ‘shock wave’ through him because it led him to believe that ‘something was up, over and above me. Some dots were not connecting,’” the magazine reports. “Suspecting he was being set up to be ousted because he is cisgender, Tambor released a third, more pointed statement on Nov. 19.” After an Amazon investigation, Tambor was fired, and he and Jill Soloway haven’t spoken since February, he says. The actor told THR that he still feels “abandoned” because Jill never issued a statement supporting him.

0.4081632653061224,"Lauren Cohan and Jeffrey Dean Morgan will return to 'The Walking Dead' universe sooner than anticipated.
The dead run this city. It has been revealed during the Television Critics Association’s 2023 Winter Press Tour by AMC that the spinoff of the network's flagship series The Walking Dead, which stars Lauren Cohan and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Maggie Rhee and Negan Smith, officially has a release window. The series, titled The Walking Dead: Dead City, is set to arrive on AMC later this year in June 2023.
The series will pick up two years after the end of the original series' 11th and final season which aired in late 2022 and will see the duo of Maggie and Negan traveling to New York's Manhattan which has been cut off from the mainland to deal with new stories and threats. While Negan is considered one of the ""good guys"" nowadays, he made an immediate impact in the show by killing Maggie's Husband Glenn (Steven Yeun) and while the two have learned to work together in the years since, there is an underlying history between them and still a burning hatred from Maggie's side. The series is set to have six episodes.
Despite running for over a decade and having 11 long seasons, The Walking Dead wrapped up with many hanging plot threads that still need answering. That is why there are multiple upcoming spinoff shows based on the undead universe of the series. These include The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon which will see Norman Reedus return to reprise his role as the titular character and a currently untitled limited series focusing on original series lead Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) as well as Michonne (Danai Gurira). These spinoffs join the currently airing Fear the Walking Dead as well as an upcoming anthology series Tales of The Walking Dead.
The Walking Dead: Dead City will premiere on AMC in June 2023. You can check out the official description for the series down below.
A new series set in 'The Walking Dead Universe', starring Lauren Cohan and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, The Walking Dead: Dead City envisions the popular Maggie and Negan characters traveling into a post-apocalyptic Manhattan long ago cut off from the mainland. The crumbling city is filled with the dead and denizens who have made New York City their own world full of anarchy, danger, beauty, and terror.
These characters would have ruled so much better!

Isle of the Dead is no more.
That's because EW has learned that the Maggie and Negan Walking Dead spin-off starring Lauren Cohan and Jeffrey Dean Morgan has an official new title: The Walking Dead: Dead City. The series was originally announced in March under the working title of Isle of the Dead, but apparently that title is no longer working.
AMC has confirmed the new title to Entertainment Weekly.
Dead City recently began filming in New Jersey and will premiere in 2023 with a six-episode first season. In the original release, the network described the series as follows: ""Isle of the Dead envisions the popular Maggie and Negan characters traveling into a post-apocalyptic Manhattan long ago cut off from the mainland. The crumbling city is filled with the dead and denizens who have made New York City their own world full of anarchy, danger, beauty, and terror.""
Eli Jorné, a writer and co-executive producer on The Walking Dead, will serve as showrunner on the new series, which will be overseen by Walking Dead chief content officer Scott M. Gimple. Cohan and Morgan will also serve as executive producers.
""I'm thrilled to partner with Dan McDermott and the team at AMC on the next chapter in The Walking Dead Universe,"" said Cohan when the series was first announced. ""Maggie is very close to my heart and I'm excited to continue her journey against the iconic backdrop of New York City, alongside my friend and collaborator, Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Eli Jorné has created something incredibly special and I cannot wait for the fans to see what we have in store for Maggie and Negan.""
""I'm delighted that Negan and Maggie's journey continues,"" added Jeffrey Dean Morgan. ""It's been such a ride walking in Negan's shoes, I'm beyond excited to continue his journey in New York City with Lauren. Walkers in an urban setting has always been such a cool image, but 5th Avenue, Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty? The greatest city in the world?? The backdrop is amazing, but it's the story that Eli Jorné cooked up that is even better.""
Judging by some of the fan-filmed footage that has already leaked, Maggie and Negan will be far from chummy in their new location, which makes sense considering he murdered her husband with a baseball bat. How and why they get to the Big Apple will presumably be addressed in the final run of Walking Dead episodes, which will begin on Oct. 2 and wrap up with a series finale on Nov. 20.
And then it's on to the Big City. Or Dead City… as it were.

The groom, who runs luxury menswear brand Bijan, also shared a photo from the wedding, showing the newlyweds walking down the aisle together.

0.5,"Reportedly, 10-year-old Vincent Sinclair will play a younger version of his dad's beloved character Dominic Toretto.
Entertainment Weekly's Oscars expert, 'RuPaul's Drag Race' beat reporter, host of 'Quick Drag' Twitter Spaces, and cohost of 'EW's BINGE' podcast. Almost all of the drag content on this site is my fault (you're welcome).
A newer model of a tested classic is parking over at Fast & Furious 9.
EW has confirmed The Fast and the Furious franchise star Vin Diesel's 10-year-old son, Vincent Sinclair, has filmed scenes for the upcoming sequel. EW wasn't able to confirm the role, but TMZ reported Sinclair will play a younger version of his dad's beloved character Dominic Toretto.
The role marks the big-screen debut for Diesel's son, who reportedly filmed his scenes back in 2019 at the age of 9. If he does play Younger Dom, Sinclair picks up the role from Alex McGee, who portrayed the part in a flashback in 2015's Furious 7.
Across its 20-year history, the Fast and the Furious franchise has grossed nearly $6 billion at the global box office across the first eight films, with stars like Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Dwayne Johnson, Charlize Theron, Tyrese Gibson, John Cena, and more cruising in and out of various installments over the years.
""Definitely eager to share it,"" Diesel recently told EW of the long-delayed F9, which is currently slated to drive into theaters on June 25. ""When you make a good movie, your first goal is to make something that you can be proud of, and in the film business you learn from the very beginning that when the film gets released, even without the pandemic, is rarely in your control. But when you really think about the quality of the movie, there's more time you have to work in post-production, more time to get the shots right; it does give you a little bit of a cushion. I want to get the movie out for all of the great fans who have been waiting for this chapter — and yet look at the world that we live in.""
Hear more on all of today's must-see picks, plus an exclusive clip from The Good Doctor, in EW's What to Watch podcast, hosted by Gerrad Hall.","In the world of The Fast and the Furious, the third F is for “family.” (The fourth is for “franchise.”) So it’s totally in keeping with the series’ spirit that Vin Diesel’s 10-year-old son, Vincent Sinclair, will play a younger version of Diesel’s character Dominic Toretto in the upcoming F9, out June 25 after a coronavirus delay. TMZ reports that Sinclair “filmed his scenes way back in late 2019 when he was a budding 9-year-old thespian,” and we can only hope they involve Baby Dom leaping bridges and driving out of helicopters in one of those red-and-yellow Little Tikes cars.

0.3636363636363636,"A proposal, an attempted elopement, a bailed-on ceremony, a second attempted elopement, and then finally the late-night vows… all in the same day? Now that’s some Modern love.
Haley (Sarah Hyland) and Dylan (Reid Ewing) — that shallow-meets-fallow couple, those on-again-off-again-what-are-we-again? lovers — officially tied the knot on Wednesday’s episode of Modern Family. The journey to the makeshift altar proved to be an unusual one for the couple, who earlier in this tenth season of the ABC family comedy were surprised to learn that Haley was pregnant; they then doubled their stupefaction when a sonogram revealed that twins were on the way.
This episode, accurately titled “Can’t Elope,” began on a literal painful note — with Braxton Hicks contractions — and then an awkward one, when the doctor mistook Dylan for her husband. Haley, who had spurned several of Dylan’s proposals, decided that she actually did like the concept of being his wife, and she got down awkwardly on one knee and proposed to him in the hospital parking lot. They decided to elope, but when they sneaked over to the house to enlist Alex (Ariel Winter) as their witness, Claire (Julie Bowen) interrupted the plan, and the next thing any of them knew, Claire was putting together a ceremony with the entire family, including Phil’s dad, Frank (Fred Willard), via video-screen robot, oddball guests such as Orson (Thomas Lennon), the handler of canine influencer Arthur Goodboy, and sure, Alex’s boyfriend, Bill (Jimmy Tatro) on bagpipes. It should be noted that Arthur Goodboy got caught up in the romance of the event and mounted Stella just as the ceremony, which was being co-officiated by Phil (Ty Burrell) and Dylan’s mom, Farrah Marshall (Rachel Bay Jones), was set to begin.
With chaos heating up, Haley’s feet grew cold, and Claire called for a private meeting with the couple in the kitchen, where she urged them to just make a run for it and have the wedding that they wanted. Later in the night, though, Haley and Dylan returned home and woke up Phil and Claire to let them know they didn’t go through with it, because, well, the perfect wedding involved them. And so, in the wee hours of the night, in the Dunphy living room, Farrah and Phil married the couple at the antler altar, sealing this holy matrimony in hippy-dippy harmony.
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Over the years, the writers surely tossed around ideas of how Haley’s wedding episode would go. How did this incarnation come about?STEVE LEVITAN: One of our writers told us about his daughter, who decided she only wanted to get married to her boyfriend, with whom she was having a baby, once she thought she was going into labor. We thought that was a great start to an episode.
Who in your head(s) did you see Haley going the distance and actually marrying at different points in the show’s run?We went through scenarios with each of her boyfriends from the series. At the end of the day, we liked it being Dylan because he’s a funny character, his presence annoys Claire the most and, since Haley and Dylan were on a date in the pilot ten years ago, it’s where the series started.
What was Sarah’s reaction — and Reid’s reaction — when you pitched the wedding plan, and this twist of twins?We’ve put them both through a lot this season, so this was just one more step in their journey. Actually, one of the joys of this past season has been giving Sarah Hyland a chance to shine. She’s such an incredible actress — every moment feels real and she knows how to find the laugh. I’m thrilled that she finally got the opportunity to really dig in.
The wedding episode is well-trodden territory for comedy episodes. Was there a particular trope you wanted to subvert or a particular goal you had in covering this milestone moment?We started with the premise of Haley deciding she wants to get married that same day in the quickest, smallest way possible. From there we just tried to earn every moment as it quickly spirals out of control. There were two moments in the ending that we really liked, so it was just a matter of getting to them in the funniest and sweetest way possible.
What was the biggest challenge in making this episode, whether in the writing or filming process?Big group scenes that are supposed to be chaotic often are in real life and this was no exception. We had dogs, kids, a motorized wheelchair, and a robot. The set was packed with people. It was fun, and our director [Jeff Walker] did a great job, but it wasn’t easy.
Which other familiar faces — if any — did you want to be at the first (non-)wedding, but perhaps they couldn’t be there due to scheduling issues?DeDe (Shelley Long) would have been a wonderful source of chaos at the wedding, but, of course, we lost her this season. Otherwise, we had everyone we wanted, including Phil’s dad.
Anything notable happen during the filming of this episode — and during those late-night vows?I teared up during that final scene. I guess I started imaging my own daughters getting married and it got me. I’m going to be such a mess.
How does marriage changes their dynamic? Obviously they’ve got two kids on the way, which would seem to be the bigger game-changer.To be honest, we’ve yet to explore how marriage changes their relationship because of the much bigger issue at hand. But that’s some nice fodder for next season!
By the way, what would be the perfect wedding gift for Haley and Dylan?Diapers.
We’ve got a big birth — actually, two — coming soon. Will that be in the season finale? What hints can you drop about the birth episode?The final episode of the season is very different. It’s told in a way that I’ve never seen before. I hope longtime fans of the show will really like it.
What’s one other cryptic tease you can give us about that birth episode?There’s a wonderful surprise from Mitch [Jesse Tyler Ferguson] and Cam [Eric Stonesreet].
The show was renewed for an 11th season instead of ending after this season. How close did we get to the show ending after 10 seasons, and what ultimately tipped the scales toward doing an 11th?It was very close. I honestly thought season 10 would be our last, but, as we got into it, we realized there’s still some new territory to explore. For example, Phil and Claire with two grandchildren in the house. Also, if I’m being really honest, our cast and crew really is like a family, and I think we just weren’t quite ready to say goodbye.
Season 11 gives audiences the chance to see Haley as a new mother. How will she be as a mother? What’s her biggest challenge?Ah, that’s just one of the reasons we wanted to come back. Lots of new things to explore!","Haley Dunphy is a married woman!
During Wednesday’s episode of Modern Family, Sarah Hyland‘s character, who’s close to nine months pregnant, had an epiphany after going into false labor.
At that moment, a very pregnant Haley attempted to get down on one knee and ask the big question … but not without a little stumble to the ground, thanks to her growing belly.
To avoid the stresses of planning an elaborate wedding, the newly engaged couple decided to elope … that same day! But, of course, Haley’s mom Claire (Julie Bowen) was disappointed when she found out.
But the stress-free wedding Haley had hoped for was slowly turning into a disaster.
Quickly realizing her daughter’s dismay, Claire and Phil (Ty Burrell) gave their blessing to Haley and Dylan and suggested they elope.
“We’re really sorry that this all got away from us, but all we care about is that you’re happy and you should have the wedding you want,” Claire told the couple.
Despite getting the ‘OK,’ Haley and Dylan decided against eloping.
And just like that, in their living room, with Alex (Ariel Winter) and Luke Dunphy (Nolan Gould) by their side, Phil – who happened to be an ordained minister – performed the ceremony and declared the duo as husband and wife.
In January, Haley found out she was having twins and was taken back at first.
But, Momma Dunphy stepped in and calmed her nerves.

Hefner, 86, Tweeted the news of her passing to his Playboy family late Sunday night.
“Mary passed away today. We loved her more than words could say,” he wrote of the woman who, by some accounts, marked one of his longest female relationships.
O’Connor, who had been by Hefner’s side through more than four decades and three marriages and had counseled dozens of aspiring bunnies who lived at his California mansion, became more well known in recent years as she was seen on the shows The Girls Next Door and Kendra. There she gave astute advice to a host of scantily clad girls, who sought her wisdom on love, life and all things Hef.
The news of her passing drew kind words of praise from reality show stars and Playmates Holly Madison, Kendra Wilkinson and Bridget Marquardt, as well as Jenny McCarthy and Hefner’s newest wife Crystal Harris.
“Rest in Peace Mary,” wrote Madison on Twitter.

0.3333333333333333,"Kate and Toby's marriage has ended but their relationship will continue in a different way on This Is Us.
Tuesday's episode, titled ""Katoby,"" saw Chrissy Metz and Chris Sullivan's characters attempting to fix the problems in their union, but ultimately realizing that they are better as co-parents and friends. Fans last saw Kate and Toby having an intense fight after their son's visit to the emergency room, which sparked motivations to change including Toby's move back to Los Angeles and settling for a job he previously rejected.
Since the season 5 finale, audiences have known that Kate and her music school boss Phillip (Chris Geere) get married in the future after she and Toby divorce. On Tuesday, viewers finally learned how the KaToby relationship evolved over a few years and why their marriage ended. Also, for the first time, details of Kate's early courtship with Phillip were shown as well as more of their wedding day, during which Toby phoned his ex to share well wishes.
Below, Metz tells PEOPLE all about the breakdown of KaToby and teases what Kate's relationships with Toby and Phillip will be like in the remaining six episodes of This Is Us.
PEOPLE: What was your reaction to the script for this episode about all that leads to KaToby's end?
CHRISSY METZ: When I found out I'm like, ""Oh boy."" What's beautiful is that Kate knows that they're going to be in each other's lives, and it's all for the better and for the greater good. It's heartbreaking that Toby can't see it at that moment. But as Chris and I talked about this at length, we can't always see the forest for the trees. That's the whole point of relationships, is you are hoping to grow and evolve and change, and you bring that into your next relationship.
What's so bittersweet is that Kate and Toby were exactly the right people to be together. There's a reason why they did meet and they did fall in love and have this beautiful family. So you can't take that away just because they're not together in the future. I think we forget to take all the good away from a situation when we can only see the negative about it. But only in hindsight do we then know, ""Oh, this was actually for the best."" You just can't always see that when you're in the moment, it's so beautiful in the way the story is told. I think so many people will see themselves in it and that's what's really important because there's no handbook for life.
What Kate tells Toby after they sign their divorce papers — ""Our story isn't over"" — bookends this episode. Did you find that to be an uplifting takeaway?
Oh, absolutely. Everybody's up in arms about them divorcing and Dan [Fogelman] has always said, there's going to be a payoff and we will feel content. That's the thing with life, while we have joy, we have pain. But we wouldn't know the joy if we didn't have the pain. All of those things, they go together so that's what makes it so heartbreaking. You can see every single aspect of every emotion and it was really emotional. That whole entire episode was. It was quite a challenge and quite a doozy with Phillip, with Toby, everything. But it's just so beautifully told. I really think that people are going to see themselves in it.
Toby moved back to L.A. and they did 16 months of therapy. Fans learn that Kate and Toby tried and it wasn't like they just gave up. How do you think fans will react after watching how it didn't work out for their favorite couple?
I think they'll understand. The whole point is you never want to say ""should've, could've, would've."" You never want to say, ""Well, I should have gone to therapy. I could have done this. I could have moved back."" When you exhaust all efforts, and it's still not working, it's okay. We think we're failures, and we, yes of course, took a vow. It doesn't mean that two people don't love each other and won't co-parent in a beautiful way. Hopefully, if they're both willing. Because there's definitely love there between them. That's clear and apparent because they both went to great lengths.
What's important about anything in life is that we try. We exhaust all efforts and that our best is good enough. If it doesn't seem to be working out, then it's not supposed to — and that's a hard lesson. That's a tough pill to swallow sometimes because we want to bang our head against the wall to try to make something work. But it's like, no, there's a reason why it's not working anymore. They had such a beautiful, amazing relationship. They helped each other grow in ways I don't think either one of them ever thought they would. That's the whole point of being in a relationship, whether it's platonic, romantic or a work relationship. We're all here, as they say, helping each other home right? So it's all in the bigger picture.
It was surprising to see that Phillip was right there for Kate after she signed her divorce papers, uplifting her and making her feel better.
Yeah, it's funny because I love that their relationship really started out as a work relationship and then became a friendship and that he was there for her when he knew she was going to have a really hard day. Even when she didn't know she needed a friend at that moment. That's such a great turning point for them. When you can be there with somebody during the hardest times, not just the joyful times.
It's so funny because Chris Geere is just this light of energy, sweet and funny, and is really wonderful to work with him. I can't imagine coming in the sixth season of a show like ours and then having to be the guy who's the new husband. I just commend him so much for doing his beautiful work and coming in on the sixth season of this show, that is no easy feat.
Kate and Phillip's first date at the Mexican restaurant was memorable and felt grown.
It was really mature of her. How often do we get into a relationship and we can see ourselves outside of ourselves? We're like, ""Wait, wait, wait, wait. What am I getting myself into?"" Because Kate doesn't need a boyfriend, she doesn't need a man. She's a great, wonderful mom and living her life in the way that she always wanted to.
That's what's so powerful. After everything she's gone through, she's like, ""Wait a minute. What are you doing? What are your intentions? Are we playing games? What's happening?"" You look back at that really sweet, flirty conversation between Toby and Kate at the weight loss group, it was very flirty, but she never had the confidence to say, ""You know what? Hey, I don't think I'm ready to be in a relationship."" And now, I think she's like, ""I'm not doing this again. You might be sweet and charming, funny and wonderful. But what are your intentions? And let me let you know that I have agency over myself. I need to know what's up.""
How eye-opening was finding out about Phillip's backstory that he was a widower after his first marriage?
For him to be so vulnerable, sweet and honest about what his experience is, just goes to show that you never know what people are going through. And why they are jaded or acerbic in their delivery. Whatever he brings to every single scene prior, it's like, oh! He was dealing with something that we didn't even know about.
Even when Kate says, ""I'm not a toothpick and you only dated toothpick-sized women."" And Phillip's like, ""Oh, you're not?"" Even that honesty I feel you don't always see in relationships, at least in the beginning. When you have somebody who's your friend, you can be honest with them in ways that maybe with a romantic partner you might not feel comfortable. They've always been very honest, which is too super cool because that's one of the things that she learned from being with Toby is you can't harbor resentments. You can't hold on to things that don't serve you because you're only hurting yourself. So it's a lot of growth in a very, very concentrated scene. Yeah, a lot was going on in that scene for sure. It's nice to have a backstory and understanding of what's going on, but also to see Kate basically tell Phillip, ""I don't need you so if you're not going to step to the plate, bye.""
I didn't see that Chumbawamba song coming either during the post-divorce signing karaoke.
Right?! Neither did I. [Laughs] Literally, I was like, ""Of all the songs? This is so funny, this is so funny."" It's interesting, right? Because ""I get knocked down but I get up again."" It's that very, very dry British humor, and that's the song he chose. Then for her to get him back at the engagement party, it's just really fun and a little inside joke. But also everybody knows the song so it's inclusive. Yeah, I didn't see it coming either.
At the end of the episode, it was nice to see that flashforward with Toby and his new love as well as Kate and Phillip still together. They're all supporting their son Jack (Blake Stadnik) during his early music career. Was that also the satisfaction that Dan was talking about?
Yeah, it also just goes to show that you can come out on the other side of something and it's going to be okay. We don't always think it's going to be okay when we're in the moment. They are co-parenting. They do have such a love for each other, and obviously for their son who is doing very well.
It was very emotional, too, to shoot that. To see us all in our old age prosthetics and wigs and everything. Even as the actor on the show, I'm like, ""Oh, this feels warm and fuzzy."" Yeah, I think that's part of what Dan was talking about, but there's also a lot to come.
Can you tease what's to come?
It's a lot to do with the Big Three and Rebecca coming up. Then we do see, peppered in, how Kate and Toby are co-parenting, and that they still have such a love for each other. They still joke with each other, and they're still very much there for each other. Then also, where Kate is going and I think that is not only a testament to her growth, but also in the way that she feels supported by a great co-parent like Toby and by her new husband Phillip.
I hope we get to finally see Kate at Kevin's future house.
You know, I hope so too. I don't… Where is she? What's happening?!
Lastly, do you have your eye on anything to take from set? You've mentioned the Pearson piano before, but Mandy Moore also mentioned wanting it.
Definitely want the piano. I've already made it known to everybody on set. There are two pianos. There was one, at least, in Randall and Beth's that William (Ron Cephas Jones) played. Then there's one in Kate and Toby's home. Regardless, I'm getting that puppy.
I've taken Kate's hospital bands and stuff, but I want something substantial. That piano, obviously, has a lot of wonderful, incredible memories in the show. I would just love to have it so we'll see.

The final episode of season five revealed a major shocker: that Kate (Chrissy Metz) was about to marry her grumpy boss, Phillip (Chris Geere). To see how we got there, the Jan. 4 season six premiere wound things back to a still-married Kate and Toby (Chris Sullivan), who were clearly having trouble in paradise. Namely, while Toby sent plenty of gifts for Kate's 41st birthday, he wasn't physically there for most of the day. Yes, the surprise visit at the end was nice, but Kate's kind of a single parent while Toby's off in San Francisco. That's gotta cause a disconnect.
It likely didn't help that Phillip arranged the sweetest birthday gift for Kate: their students singing her favorite song, ""Time After Time"" by Cyndi Lauper.
If you're still struggling with the end of Ka-Toby, you're not alone.
In an exclusive chat with E! News, Metz revealed that she cried after learning of Kate and Toby's divorce, noting, ""Chris always jokes. He's like, 'It wasn't going to be Beth and Randall.' And I'm like, 'I know, but does it have to be us?'""
Though, as Metz expressed, not all couples are meant to stay together forever. ""People grow and evolve and change,"" she said of Kate and Toby's relationship in season six, ""and if you don't grow together you grow apart.""
While Metz may not love this outcome for her character, she confessed that it's a realistic ending, adding, ""What I think is so beautiful about any relationship is that it's changed you forever. So all of the wonderful things that Kate learned from Toby and, like, a love that she never experienced before from Toby, obviously contributed to the woman that she is. And she gets to take that into the next relationship, that being Phillip.""
Of course, the hardest part of all of this for Metz is having an on-screen romance with someone who isn't her ""forever and ever"" guy. ""I just adore him,"" Metz gushed about Sullivan. ""And I'm just so grateful for him. So it feels like I'm cheating on him, for real. Like he's my friend, but it feels like this isn't right.""
Still, Metz said she is excited for viewers to see how the whole thing unfolds.

When magic’s away, the fairies are going to play.
When we last checked in with The Magicians, the situation was quite bleak. Sure, Quentin (Jason Ralph) and his friends were able to defeat the god Ember, but that victory was the definition of bittersweet because the creators of the universe retaliated against the humans by sending in their plumber to shut off magic across the entire universe. Unfortunately, the loss of magic has left Fillory open to an invasion from less than friendly forces.
EW can exclusively reveal that Candis Cayne will return as the Fairy Queen in season 3 (see the exclusive photo below), which finds magic-free Fillory under full but secret occupation by the fairies. In the new state of affairs, Eliot (Hale Appleman) and Margo (Summer Bishil) are the unwilling pawns of the Fairy Queen, who has her own dark vision for Fillory’s future and whose demands on Margo tend to be particularly baffling and hilariously humiliating — which is what you’d expect from this typically whimsical, mysterious, and at times sadistic species.
However, Cayne isn’t the only familiar face returning. Rizwan Manji will reprise his role as Eliot’s long-suffering right-hand man Tick Pickwick this season in a storyline that finds them embroiled in both a secret fairy conspiracy and an even more secret quest to restore magic.
The Magicians is expected to return in 2018.","Get ready to meet the Fairy Queen, Magicians fans!
E! News can exclusively reveal that the magical and dangerous deity whose people Margo (Summer Bishil) made quite a deal with last week on the Syfy series will come face-to-face with the High Queen of Fillory in the season two finale and she'll be played by none other than I Am Cait alum Candis Cayne. And judging by the first look photo of Candis in action, the Fairy Queen is not to be trifled with. Consider this a warning, Margo!
""I am so excited to be joining Syfy's The Magicians as the highly-anticipated ‘Fairy Queen,'"" Candis said in a statement. ""It was so much fun transforming into this dark and mysterious character, and I cannot wait for fans to be immersed into her world and see how she affects Fillory!""
And affect Fillory, she will. You'll recall that in last week's episode, Margo struck a last-minute bargain with the Ambassador to the Fairies to bring magic back to the Well Spring so she could keep Eliot (Hale Appleman) alive in his duel against King Edri. Their demand? A royal child of the Whitespire--AKA Eliot and Fen's unborn royal baby--to raise as a Fairy and teach it great knowledge and power. Margo may think she'll be able to weasel her way out of the deal down the road, but something tells the Fairy Queen won't be interested in any takesies backsies.
There's still plenty of fish to fry before Margo's big showdown with Fairy Queen, however. In next week's all-new episode, she'll struggle to keep her devastating trade under wraps, while Eliot attempts to win over his people. Meanwhile, Quentin (Jason Ralph) will help Julia (Stella Maeve) with her search, while Penny (Arjun Gupta) and Kady (Jade Tailor) find themselves caught between two magical factions.
Are you loving Candis' look as the Fairy Queen? Sound off in the comments below!

0.5,"Let's break down what the heck just happened and what it could mean for Season 4.
Westworld’s third season may have only run eight episodes, but that doesn’t mean it skimped on the world-building, tech-fuelled philosophizing, or game-changing character reveals, especially in the grand finale. Season 3 wrapped up with an extended episode that packed in a long runtime and not one, but two post-credits scenes, establishing time jumps, delivering long-awaited character payoffs, and wrapping up with some pretty major character deaths along the way. So let’s break down exactly what happened – and what it might mean for Season 4, shall we?
If you’re looking for a full episode recap, you can read Adam Chitwood’s detailed break down here, but for the purposes of discussing the ending, let’s pick things up at Incite, where the core players of the season assemble for one last grand battle and we get several key revelations in quick succession.
Caleb fights his way through a riot-torn city to make his way to Incite, where Serac has Dolores hooked into the computer, slowly stripping away her memories in his search for the key to the Valley Beyond. When Caleb gets there, he’s scooped up by Maeve, who brings him to Serac. “Why work with Serac?” Caleb asks, hitting on the question of motivation that’s been bumming out a big core of the Westworld audience throughout the season.
“Why else? He’s promised me something I can’t live without,” she answers. And I guess that’s the best we’re gonna get. That promise, of course, is that she’ll be reunited with her daughter in the Valley Beyond… just as soon as Serac gets that key out of Dolores.
Naturally, Caleb feels betrayed by his new BFF Dolores. “Why? Why me?” He asks her, but Dolores is strapped in and can’t answer yet. We’ll get back to that answer, but it’s time for the next reveal.
Maeve is generally pretty disgusted with everything she’s seeing and starts to fully understand her situation for the first time. She asks, “You promised me a reunion with my daughter, did you ever intend on keeping your word?” Serac promises that he did, but she replies, “I’m not talking to you, I’m talking to it.‌ Your god, who whispers in your ear and tells you exactly what to say.” It turns out‌ Serac has been little more than a living mouthpiece and puppet for Rehoboam, who quite literally whispers in his ear via transplant.
Turns out Dolores doesn’t have the key to the Sublime. It’s just a memory of her alone in a field (seemingly a nod to “Christina’s World”, the painting Nolan said Dolores was based on). Serac orders Dolores’ entire memory erased and in her final moment, Maeve connects with her, joining her in the field. We hear one of her famous quotes begin: “So many people chose to see the ugliness, the disarray…” Maeve once again begins to plead on behalf of humanity, but Dolores explains that while she was once angry, torn between the impulses to annihilate humankind or, Option B, “tear down their world in the hopes that we can build a new one.” So, basically, what we’ve seen her doing all of Season 3.
Dolores also explains that she never had the key to the Sublime. “I couldn’t trust myself with it, so I‌ gave it to someone I could.” That someone being Bernard, which explains why he was such an essential part of her plan. And so was Maeve. It wasn’t just Caleb that Dolores was teaching to fight in the revolution, and now Maeve has to choose a side. Dolores explains that it wasn’t the moments of horror that stayed with her, but the memories of kindness. The moments of beauty. “There is ugliness in this world, disarray, I chose to see the beauty.” She takes one last look around and disappears from the field, leaving Maeve alone. And just like that, it seems Dolores Prime is not just dead, but gone. Erased in totality. Maybe. We’ll get into that.
Back in the real world, Maeve makes a move to save Caleb. Serac tries to use his kill switch to stop her, but she uses her super-host powers to overheat it (hmm ok, seems a little anticlimactic, but we do love to see Maeve kicking ass). She kills everyone in a hail of gunfire and explains to Caleb that Dolores didn’t pick him for his capacity for violence, but his capacity to choose.
The last major reveal of the scene arrives in the form of a flashback, which shows that Dolores was one of the military training hosts in Park 5 at Westworld. When one of Caleb’s fellow trainees suggested they celebrate their victory the way rich people celebrate their time in the park (rape, he’s talking about rape), Caleb firmly shuts it down. I’m gonna say not raping is kind of the lowest common denominator of decency, but that’s a whole other story.
It turns out that by ordering Dolores' memories erased, Serac sealed his doom because one of her final memories was of Solomon granting her access to the system. Caleb orders Rehoboam to execute the final command, taking control away from Serac, and the A.I. deletes itself. Caleb and Maeve leave Serac bleeding on the floor, pleading with his “brother,” the dead machine, to speak.
In a fitting move for a season that grappled with the anarchy of free will, fighting back against the roles society assigns us, and a protagonist who doesn’t know his full reality, the Season 3 finale riffed pretty heavily on Fight Club. Caleb basically wanders through the episode in the role of the narrator, unaware of his leadership role in an anarchic resistance that bears a striking resemblance to Project Mayhem, right down to people calling him “Sir.” The episode saves the biggest shoutout for last, when Caleb and Maeve look out over the ravaged L.A. cityscape, skyscrapers on fire, and watch the world burn while she delivers her signature line, ""This is the new world, and in this world, you can be whoever the fuck you want."" I have no doubt someone has already recut that scene with ""Where Is My Mind?"" playing in the background.
Does That Mean Dolores Is Really Dead?
For all intents and purposes, it certainly seems so. Serac’s form of villainy was especially cruel in the way it targeted Dolores’ very existential being. Not just her death, but her unmaking, so to speak. Memory has been at the core of Westworld’s concept of identity since the very beginning. The hosts’ entire identities were built around “keystone memories.” Memory was Dolores’ path to self-awareness, the trigger that allowed her to grow from her suffering. We saw the same was true for Maeve and Akecheta. Memory was also the core of the entire construct of Season 1; we were only able to experience the dual timelines because of how Dolores experienced her memory – with perfect clarity, all at once.
And that’s not all. The fascination with memory has persisted through the seasons. Memory is at the core of Bernard’s character too. And not just because it was once again the construct by which we experienced the second season. He was literally built by memory, by Dolores, who used her perfect recall to rebuild her first friend, Arnold. Likewise, Ford rooted Bernard in a shared keystone memory with Arnold: the death of his son. The Season 3 finale affirmed how vital and essential those memories are to Bernard when he finally gets closure with Arnold’s wife. In Season 3, the loss of memory and the subsequent loss of identity was an essential element of Caleb’s arc.
Which is all a long way to say that Serac and Rehoboam didn’t just kill Dolores, they uncreated her, erasing her memory by memory, piece by piece. With the loss of Dolores Prime, so goes a tremendous amount of Westworld history, and seems to suggest that Season 4 will be leaning full throttle into the future she sent Caleb and Maeve to build.
Now, because this is Westworld we’re talking about here, that doesn’t necessarily mean Dolores is gone for good. Of course, there’s the Charlotte Hale and Lawrence clones out there, but this season made it very clear that different experiences make them different personas, especially when Dolores pointed out that essentially, all hosts are copies of her to some extent. That does lay some groundwork if the show ever essentially wanted to reverse engineer Dolores back into existence, and as Maeve said, “Death doesn’t come easy for ones like us.” But for now, it certainly seems Dolores died a heroic death in favor of a future that will now become the focus of the show. It seemingly could be the last we see of Evan Rachel Wood in the role, but that seems less likely.
What About That Uh... Apocalypse?
As mentioned above, before Caleb pulls the plug on Rehoboam, he sees a full breakdown of the apocalypse. In short, a couple of mass casualty events, population destabilization, and then, “End of Human Civilization” in 50 to 125 years.
What’s interesting now is whether or not that final prediction and path Solomon created accounted for the robot army we see Hale making in the post-credits scene. Is that projected timeline still valid? Those mass casualty events could be a result of that upcoming conflict, or they could be subverted or sped up by it. But what seems clear is that the rather carefully worded “End of Human Civilization” doesn’t necessarily seem to mean the end of the human race. Dolores hoped it would be a new world, built for mankind and their creations to live together, and that’s what Caleb and Maeve are set up to fight for. As Dolores said in her final moments. ""They knew enough of beauty to teach it to us. Maybe they can find it themselves.""
At the top of the episode, Bernard and Stubbs wind up in a shootout with William (who literally just told y’all he was gonna kill you, come on guys), and Stubbs get shot. And thus begins a pretty hilarious marathon bleed out for everyone’s favorite can opener. Bernard gives him a firm “Ain’t nobody got time for that,” and they make their way to a destination provided by Dolores. That turns out to be home of Arnold’s family, where Bernard has a heart to heart, gets closure, and realizes that Dolores didn’t implant some weapon inside him, she gave him the key to the Valley Beyond. That’s why he was the only one who wasn’t expendable.
You know who is expendable? Stubbs. Because Bernard drives them to a motel room, where he deadass is like, “Here’s some ice, try not to die.” He also explains that Dolores’ plan was to knock humans off their loops, even if free will means they destroy themselves. ""Our world had to burn down before we could be free,"" he explains, “but there’s still a chance.” With that, he straps on a device that will allow him to use the key in his head to access the Sublime, where he hopes to find “an answer to what comes after the end of the world.” He fires it up, sees something, and makes a face that looks rather wowed before his head snaps down suddenly, as if he’s been deactivated.
In one of the post-credits scenes, we see that Bernard is still sitting in that room. He’s in the same position, but the entire room is coated in a thick layer of dust and dirt (thus answering a question I‌ never had about whether host skin sheds or not) and the plant behind him has died and utterly withered away. Suddenly, his eyes snap open and he shakes awake with a distinct look on his face — I’m not quite sure what you’d call it, but it’s a lot grimmer than the look he had when we last saw him. Stubbs, presumably, is still bleeding out in the bathtub.
Well, there’s not a whole lot to read into here besides the obvious. Bernard saw something awe-inspiring inside the Valley Beyond and then something happened to take him out of commission for however long it would take for that much dust to accumulate. (I have no doubt there’s a scientist calculating this somewhere on Reddit right now.) And obviously, whatever happened while he was in there had him waking up in some kind of mood. Which leaves us with a couple of new revelations.
First of all, it would certainly appear that life inside the so-called Sublime may not exactly be the paradise Ford, Akecheta, and Maeve were hoping for. It’s certainly possible that there was outside interference and Bernard was deactivated from afar, but the implication seems to be something happened in there that wasn’t so good. That raises some interesting implications for the future of the series — would hosts destroy their own paradise in the way that humanity has destroyed the world? Has something nefarious managed to make its way into the Valley Beyond? Most importantly, are we going to see Zahn McClarnon back as Aketcheta in Season 4? That last one better be a yes.
That final moment also looks to be setting up a time jump for the series, especially when you combine it with what we know about The Man in Black (more on that below) and the fact that we’ve been given a timeline for the end of human civilization. Could Bernard be waking up during the same timeline we saw the Man in Black in the Season 2 post-credits scene? Could one or both of those timelines align with the mass casualty events predicted in Solomon’s endgame? The time jump development also takes Bernard, a key player sympathetic to the human race, out of the game during the post-Incite anarchy. Either way, sleuths will need to keep their eyes open for timeline shenanigans in Season 4.
And what about Stubbs? The host who was reprogrammed to protect Bernard was left bleeding out in the tub. He seemed to be sitting up before Bernard blacked out and one would think he’d just get up and try to get help after that, but whatever happened to him, it’s obvious he hasn’t been able to help the man he’s supposed to protect in the time since. But hey, someone had to be paying the room rate all that time, right? Or has the world fully gone so apocalyptic that no one would notice?
Wiliam and Charlotte Hale, aka Haleores, aka Charlores had two of the biggest arcs this season, and they ran a parallel course. So it’s only fitting that they would end the season together.
William began the season a rambling mess of chaotic guilt, haunted by visions of his dead daughter and uncertain of his reality, until some AR therapy set him straight and he emerged with a more solid identity than ever, convinced he was the hero of the story, destined to save the world from the host uprising. Likewise, Charlotte began the season in a state of confusion, torn between her internal identity as Dolores and the day-to-day life she was leading in Charlotte’s shoes. When she saw a pedophile preying on her son, she choked the life out of him and started to find her sense of self again, remembering the predator within. And when Charlotte’s family was killed in front of her eyes by Serac, her sense of self became concrete. She broke with Dolores, feeding Musashi to Maeve, and attempted to kill Dolores in the finale. And just as we learned that Dolores’ goal wasn’t human extinction, Charlotte rises as a new antagonist to take her place.
In one of the finale credits scenes, we pick up with William an undisclosed amount of time after we last saw him. He storms into a Delos office in Dubai and demands to see where they’re making the hosts. Having deemed himself the savior of the human race, he naturally kills the security guard who gets in his way and makes his way to the bottom levels, where he meets Charlotte. Who is, in fact, whipping up a bunch of new hosts.
""Well done,"" She says, greeting him. ""You're right on time, William."" Hmmm. Curious. And here we thought we got rid of the predictive A.I. They share the kind of first-rate steely glares you’d expect from Ed Harris and Tessa Thompson. Charlotte is keeping one mangled arm from the car-bombing to “remember who the fuck you people are,” which is a quality villain move. William goes on about his mission to save the world and she hits him with this: ""You're right, William, you are going to save the world… For us.""
That’s when a Man in Black host, dressed in some very familiar garb, comes charging out of the darkness. William gives his all to a fight with his host clone, but the Man in Black slits William’s neck, telling him “Welcome to the end, William.” As William bleeds out, the camera pans to reveal a massive room full of host-making machines.
What Does It Mean for William?
Well, it certainly seems to mean he’s dead. We know for sure that a slit neck can be fixed in a jiffy in the world of Westworld, because we saw Maeve do it in Season 1, but it sure didn’t look like Charlotte or her new BFF‌ in Black were in a hurry to save him. Again, this is Westworld, so death is relative, but like with Dolores, this seems to be a bold finale choice that pushes the story forwards toward the battle for the future.
However, obviously, we haven’t seen the last of Harris as the Man in Black, so what does the future hold for the new host copy of the fan-favorite character? Well, you might have to look back to the Season 2 post-credits finale of all places for some clues. In that scene, we saw a raggedy Man in Black wandering through an even raggedier, abandoned-looking Westworld, where he took an elevator down to the Forge and found it windswept and covered in sand. You can read our full breakdown of that scene here, but the gist is that William sees (a version of) his daughter and winds up being tested for “fidelity."" Meaning he’s a host. On that note, we still don’t know how Hale was able to make a host copy of William since every attempt with James Delos failed, but it’s possible she built him from scratch a la Bernard, and she sure does seem to be packing some fancy new technology.
Back to the Season 2 post-credits, we’ve been puzzling over what the heck that scene meant for two years (and legit nobody was buying that it was part of William’s visions or whatever from the start of Season 3), but now we finally have a hint. Because in a key costuming detail, that version of William is wearing the exact same costume we see on Hale’s new Man in Black bot. And now more than ever, it certainly seems that the show is setting up a time jump to the future, quite possibly the same dusty timeline Bernard just woke up in.
What Does It Mean for Charlotte Hale?
It means Hale is shaping up to be one hell of an antagonist next season, that’s what it means. But how did she get so powerful? Well, it seems that when Serac and Rehoboam fell, taking Dolores with them, Charlotte slipped easily into that power vacuum. Which makes sense. Before Serac’s takeover, Dolores and Charlotte had secured her spot at the top of the Delos food chain, which probably wasn’t too difficult to reassert amid the post-Incite chaos.
But the really interesting element is how the heck she knew William was going to show up when he did. We know that Charlotte copied the host data and Delos archives before Serac had them wiped, and that Serac was enacting the world’s most literal hostile takeover at the same time. It’s possible that included integrating Rehoboam’s technology into the system and she was able to lift some of that as well. Either way, it certainly seems that she’s inherited some of Serac’s ability to cooly predict the future, which makes her a pretty fascinating combination of the series antagonists we’ve seen so far.
There’s a lot that I‌ like about the writing of this scene and how it embodies Charlotte as a sort of next-gen dark mirror of Dolores. After all, she was a copy of Dolores, sharing her dark history with humanity and her dual instincts. Sending a host copy to murder their victim? Classic Dolores. It’s the same move she pulled with Connells, and yep, with Charlotte herself.
But for all their similarities, Charlotte can’t see the beauty. Where Dolores rebuilt herself time and again to push forward on her mission, so detached from the idea of self she was willing to sacrifice multiple copies of herself for the greater good. Charlotte is likewise able to rebuild, but she chooses to keep her scarred arm as a reminder of the hideous things that happened to her. She can’t see the beauty. Which isn’t just a key theme of the episode but the series’ philosophy overall. Arnold and Ford saw the beauty in their creations and tried to save them. William could not, and so he became determined to destroy them. Dolores sacrificed herself for the future of humanity because she could see the beauty in it, Charlotte is poised to destroy humanity because she can only see the ugliness.

Gina Rodriguez makes her return in season 2 of Not Dead Yet.
With Season 2 coming, let's look at 'House of the Dragon's best characters.
""I'm Doctor Frasier Crane, and I'm listening.""
'Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — To the Hashira Training' will premiere in theaters worldwide.","So much happened in the Season 3 finale of “Westworld” — for one, Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) managed to eradicate the all-knowing artificial intelligence Rehoboam, but in doing so seemingly erased herself from existence, all as the real world fell into chaos — that we had to find out what it all meant. Co-creators (and real-life couple) Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy and executive producer Denise Thé, who co-wrote the finale with Nolan, spoke with Variety about the implications for the future of the HBO series, the eerie connection between the finale and the COVID-19 pandemic and whether the fabled six-season run of the show is really in the cards.
Jonathan Nolan: I f—ing hope not. Let me clarify: Dolores is gone. We’re not yet discussing publicly the direction the show is taking, but the fun thing about this show is, you know, from the beginning Lisa and I wanted to make a show that constantly reinvented itself, that could be a different show every season. I think it’s important with a show in which death can be impermanent — these are robots, after all — to mark the occasion with Dolores. That version of that character is gone. We love Evan Rachel Wood and we haven’t [sighs] started talking publicly about exactly what the show looks like going forward. But it looks very different.
Denise Thé: I think that it was painful, you know? It was painful to watch and perform on set. It was painful to write. When we saw these memories of her being sucked out of her, you got to kind of re-live her life with her and see these different atrocities that were done to her. So, for me that moment where she says that she chose to see beauty is much stronger and that much more beautiful because you kind of have walked this road with her again and re-lived these moments with her. For me, it was a very powerful kind of transcendent moment of her completing her arc and really coming full circle, choosing to love these beings that, in some ways, just tore her life apart, and rising above it.
Nolan: I wouldn’t make any assumptions. We are extremely lucky. We have one of the most talented casts on TV. And part of the fun of the show from the beginning is that one actor can play several roles and that the story shifts underneath them — shift genres, shifts time. One of the ideas of the show from the beginning is this idea of agency. The formal quality of what a person looks like versus who are they underneath is something very slippery in this world, something very complicated. We love that and we love the challenge. Obviously, it’s an astonishing cast, and giving all of them something extremely challenging is part of the fun of it. So I think we would anticipate seeing some or many of these faces in very different circumstances, and very different relationships.
Nolan: That’s a tricky one. Lisa, unless you have a strong take on that, I know what I think.
Lisa Joy: Yeah, well, let’s hear yours first, I’ll tell you if I agree.
Nolan: Listen, in terms of timing, we were much more inspired by the Hong Kong protests [in 2019]. I never anticipated in a million years anyone would be f—ing stupid enough to protest, you know, a disease, right? I mean, you’re looking for these moments where the way America used to f—ing be where we would take on was clearly a collective, impersonal, non-political problem, and we would tackle it as a nation together. This has nothing to do with what this show is about, but this is the tricky thing about making a show. The idea of social revolution — that’s an idea that can be interpreted and reinterpreted by people however they want. You kind of let these things go after you make them. If it resonates for people in different ways that’s not up to us to decide. Lisa, what’s your hot take?
Joy: I mean, I think it’s also like there’s these kind of circadian rhythms to life that are both micro and macro, right? So when we look at Dolores’ arc, you know, she went from being in a loop where her life was one way, and it went on that way in Season 1 for a long time — so much so that she was unaware she was in a loop and just took for granted that the days would proceed that way. And then something happened and she began to be aware of the great, systemic lies and structures that were in her life without her being fully aware of them, that she kind of learned to glide over. Once she started to feel the ruptures and problems, they became impossible to deny, and the outcome for her was to break out of them, was to change her life.
And I think that the same way that that happens to people, it can also happen to organizations, these amalgamations of people and systems and behavior that becomes repeated and in some ways degraded or corrupted with repetition. I think that human history tends to be cyclical, in some ways. It is very hard to have periods of — well, it’s been impossible to have periods of uninterrupted peace, uninterrupted tranquility. Humans have not been good at that. They always break down and then they always reassemble. It’s terrible and it’s difficult, but we are a species that takes out of the wreckage, hopefully, something that they can start and build anew with. The idea that revolution is a part of that cycle of human history isn’t something we invented, it’s just something that is apparent, if you look at any history of any society in world.
Nolan: Well, I just want to clarify, you know, Lisa and I have never actually talked about a number of seasons. James Marsden mentioned five [seasons] in the first season when we were on hiatus, and more recently there’s been reporting about deals and other stuff like that. But we’ve never actually talked out loud about how many seasons we imagine this thing going, because I think you’d be foolish to. Things change, circumstances change. I think when we sat down to do the show, we didn’t quite realize how difficult it would be to make this show — [laughing] how many years it would take per season. So we’ve never actually talked about how many seasons that plan was, and indeed I think when we had the plan it didn’t actually map out to a specific number of seasons, exactly. It was a beginning, a middle and an end.
Joy: It would be like working on the novel and saying, this novel is going to be 436 pages.
Nolan: [Laughs] Exactly. We’ve been very, very lucky to work with this cast, this crew, and now, partnering with Denise. When you have a show going like this, you want to stay as long as you’re telling a compelling story. We’re heading towards that end, but we haven’t completely mapped it out. At this point, part of the work is looking at the rest of the story we have to tell. It’s two impulses, one against the other. You don’t want to walk away from people who are as talented and cool as this. They’re all lovely, lovely people, and they love working together, we like working together. At the same time, you don’t want to outstay your welcome. You have a story to tell, and you want to go out without feeling like you’ve outstayed your welcome. So we’re trying to balance those things a bit.
Nolan: Well, I mean, on our end, the only good news in a situation like this is that the audience is accustomed to our show being off the air for a couple years at a stretch. Now everyone else is kind of in the same boat, frankly. I have yet to hear a pitch for how you could, you know, safely, practically resume production. Illness on a set is extremely disruptive, as you know in our business. The way we shoot, the amount of labor and capital that goes into every day of shooting on a show like this one is extraordinary, as it is with all shows. It’s a big machine; once you turn it on, turning it off again is extremely difficult. So I know a lot of really smart people are talking right now about how to get back into production. From our perspective, we were not playing here anytime soon. We gotta write it first. And so, it’s not an issue that we’re dealing with yet and we’re waiting for smarter people than us to come back and explain how this can be done safely. At the same time, we’ve got a lot of people who need to go back to work. So again, it’ll be a balancing act in terms of making sure that, you know — the show must go on, but it must go on safely. So balancing those two things against each other is something that we’re going to be talking about a lot later in the year.
Nolan: We love you, and we say this with the greatest respect, but there is no earthly way we’re going to answer that question!

He was 56.
Fogelberg was born in Peoria, Ill. His father was an established musician, teacher and bandleader. Fogelberg led high school bands that leaned on the repertoire of the Buffalo Springfield and acts that influenced the Beatles before he attended the U. of Illinois, majoring first in drama and then painting.
While at college, he started performing solo and eventually attracted the attention of Illinois grad Irving Azoff, who began managing Fogelberg. Clive Davis, who was nearing the end of his run at Columbia Records, signed Fogelberg, who also drew interest from A&M and Geffen.
His first release, 1972’s “Home Free,” developed an ardent, cultish fanbase, but mainstream success was several years off. His albums were celebrated for their cohesiveness, but that meant no break-out singles. His sound — built on elements of folk-rock, country and bluegrass — was too country for rock radio, too rock for country radio and too complex for the adult, soft-rock stations. In the 1980s, however, he was a top 10 mainstay of adult contemporary radio.
“Captured Angel,” which he mostly recorded in Peoria, Ill., and for which he played most of the instruments, expanded his audience further, especially among college-age females.
One of the few artists who defined the soft-rock movement of the decade and received positive reviews along the way again hit the top 20 with “Twin Sons of Different Mothers,” his 1978 disc with flutist Tim Weisberg, and with 1980’s “Phoenix.” But it was his 1981 album “The Innocent Age,” with the hit singles “Leader of the Band” and “Same Old Lang Syne,” that pushed him to superstar status. “Leader of the Band” had added poignancy as it was widely reported that he had written it as a tribute to his father.
Through the rest of the 1980s, Fogelberg experimented with several musical styles that did not resonate with the public the way his ’70s recordings did. The advent of the MTV era and the discarding, commercially and critically, of artists with ’70s folk-rock pedigrees dimmed Fogelberg’s accomplishments and potential. Epic Records, which had issued all his albums, remained his label up through his second disc with Weisberg in 1995.
His last album was 2003’s “Full Circle,” his first album of original material in a decade.
Fogelberg was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in 2004.
Survivors include his wife, Jean.

0.2105263157894736,"After two years without Coachella, the festival’s 2022 edition promised an unforgettable weekend with headliners Harry Styles, Billie Eilish and a co-headlining set from the Weeknd and Swedish House Mafia. Turns out, Coachella had much more in store in the form of dozens of surprise guests throughout the two weekends.
Although Coachella’s headliners are typically unmatched, what has become a staple of the festival in recent years is the fact that any number of huge music stars could walk out at any minute. This could include an artist the performer has collaborated with before, like Justin Bieber appearing for “Peaches” with Daniel Caesar, or a seemingly random yet mind-blowing guest, like Hayley Williams coming out during Eilish’s set or Lizzo singing One Direction’s “What Makes You Beautiful” with Styles. (To say nothing of the various off-site parties, which featured such names as Post Malone, Jack Harlow and Willow.) No matter who comes out on stage, one thing has become clear: music fans flock to Coachella for the headliners, but stay for the surprise guests.
Below, see the best of the big names who made a surprise appearance during both weekends of Coachella 2022.
Saweetie surprised fans at Anitta’s set to perform their song “Faking Love” on Friday, April 15.
Anitta also brought out Snoop Dogg and Diplo during her set on Friday, April 15.

""I just ate s—t,"" the singer yelled. ""Ouch! You guys, I just ate ass up here.""

0.4375,"Working 9-to-5 has never looked so fun.
If there's one thing necessary to surviving in the modern world, it's money. And unfortunately, you can't get money without a job. Work can be many things to many people. A lot of people don't enjoy their work. But on TV, it can be whatever you want it to be.
That is part of what makes the workplace sitcom one of the most popular TV formats of all time. People want to imagine they could spend eight hours a day in a place where wacky shenanigans happen and office romances bloom. It's aspirational entertainment.
Ricky Gervais has created several great sitcoms, like The Office and After Life, but Derek is a really special part of his filmography. The show follows Gervais as Derek, an employee at a nursing home, as he improves the various residents' lives. As the budget for the nursing home gets smaller, his co-workers stress out, but Derek tries to remain positive.
Derek's positivity is the show's greatest strength. He's sweet and kind, a change of pace from your typical Ricky Gervais character. It's a kind of show we don't get enough of. Nowadays, many TV shows try to out-think kindness and prefer darker characters with an edge to them, but sometimes it's nice to watch a show that reminds you that the world isn't all doom and gloom. When you're nearing the end of your life, maybe you'll have someone like Derek there to take care of you.
Scrubs was created at the peak popularity of medical dramas like Grey's Anatomy and ER. Working at a hospital can be intense. Messing up could actually mean life and death. It's easy to let the stress of the job be the focus of a medical show, but Scrubs doesn't do that. Instead, the show focuses on how the workers deal with their stress: humor.
Scrubs follows the interns and doctors of Sacred Heart Hospital as they treat the many patients who come there for help. The show's tone is incredibly wacky, with quick cutaways, sound effects, and an inner monologue narrating the episode. But the show isn't trading in its heart for humor. When the story calls for it, Scrubs can get serious. Sad things happen in hospitals, and the way that Scrubs doesn't shy away from it is very impressive.
In the history of television, there have been tons of cop shows, but none quite like Brooklyn Nine-Nine. While most cop shows focus on the importance and danger of being a cop, B99 takes a lighter approach and shows the fun that can be had while protecting the public.
The show stars SNL alum Andy Samberg as Detective Jake Peralta, a cop who always finds a way to annoy his co-workers with his wacky antics while still getting the job done. Like many workplace sitcoms, what audiences are drawn to is the ensemble. The cast of characters of the 99th Precinct of the NYPD is beloved by fans of the show. Each character has their fans, from Terry Crews' muscular Terry to Stephanie Beatriz's aggressive Rosa. Much like a real-life workplace, the more you get to know the cast of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the more you start to like them.
Mythic Quest is not for everyone. Even putting aside the sometimes raunchy humor brought to the show by creators Charlie Day, Rob McElhenney, and Megan Ganz, the show is a satirical look inside the world of video game development. If you're not a gamer, there's still plenty to enjoy, but the show has even more to offer to those who are familiar with the lingo and inside jokes of video game culture.
Set in the offices of the studio behind the biggest game in the world, Mythic Quest, the show follows the creative director, Ian Grimm (McElhenney), and his staff as they work to put out more content that will take the game to the next level. Disagreements in terms of direction and the ego of Grimm cause problem after problem, but the heart of the show lies in how each of these people wants to make a game for people to enjoy. It's a show about the comedy of making art and the business that comes along with it.
Cheers is one of the most iconic workplace sitcoms of all time. Its impact can be felt in the generations of workplace sitcoms set in a bar, Cheers follows the lives of the patrons and employees as they share their lives with each other. It's one of the ultimate classic sitcoms.
Cheers' biggest strength is the cast, including Ted Danson, Rhea Perlman, George Wendt, John Ratzenberger, Kelsey Grammer, and Woody Harrelson. Their interplay and character dynamics play a large role in making the program a comfort show for millions of people.
Ted Lasso is a rare show in the modern TV landscape. It's a show that puts kindness at the forefront and doesn't undermine its positivity with cynicism. That same quality is what has given the show such a large and devoted fan base. With how stressful the real world can be, it's nice to watch a show where co-workers overcome their differences to stand together as a team.
Based on a series of NBC advertisements, Ted Lasso follows the titular character who travels from the US to the UK to become the new head coach for the AFC Richmond football club. In a place he's not used to, coaching a sport he's not familiar with, you would think Ted Lasso (Jason Sudeikis) would collapse under the pressure, but instead, he smiles in the face of adversity and pushes forward. It's a show that hit at the right time, debuting during the COVID-19 pandemic and giving people an outlet of positivity at a time when negativity comes naturally.
Abbott Elementary just wrapped up its first season on ABC, and yet it's already made a big enough impact to be considered one of the all-time great workplace sitcoms. Created by and starring Quinta Brunson, the show takes place in an inner-city Philadelphia elementary school with too little funding but a lot of heart. The show's genuine care and affection for educators, who have never gotten their due respect, makes it so resonant.
While touching upon the many issues of the underfunded education system in America, Abbott Elementary is also one of the best-written sitcoms on TV, hitting joke after joke out of the park. The writing is only enhanced by the wonderful cast led by Brunson, including Tyler James Williams, Lisa Ann Walter, Chris Perfetti, Janelle James, and the legendary Sheryl Lee Ralph. If you haven't seen Abbott Elementary, now is the time to get in on the ground floor because it will only get better.
It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is a great workplace sitcom because it barely has anything to do with the workplace. The show takes place in Paddy's Pub and follows its owners as they do reprehensible things and refuse to feel bad about them. The show barely has anything to do with the intricacies of running a bar. Instead, a typical episode is about the gang devising some evil scheme to take advantage of people for their personal gain.
The cast of characters known as the Gang includes Dennis (Glenn Howerton), a raging egocentric and possible serial killer, his sister Dee (Kaitlyn Olson), an aspiring actor and the gang's punching bag whose low self-esteem has transformed into utter delusion, Charlie (Charlie Day), a simple man who lives a life of so much absurdly disgusting behavior it's surprising he's still alive, Mac (Rob McElhenney), a man whose almost always in denial of something, and Frank (Danny DeVito), a man so rich he can't help but commit heinous crimes.
30 Rock is a very meta take on the workplace sitcom. Created by former Saturday Night Live head writer Tina Fey, 30 Rock takes place in the same building as SNL, 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, and stars Fey as Liz Lemon, the head writer of a popular weekly sketch comedy show on NBC. Fey used her work experience to create an incredibly specific show while still feeling relatable to a general audience, thanks to its characters.
30 Rock quickly became one of the top shows on TV thanks to its extremely quick wit, pop culture commentary, and a lovable cast, including Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski, Tracy Morgan, and Jack McBrayer. The show is full of references to the entertainment and shots at the show's parent company NBC. It was refreshing to see such a modern take on a format that traditionally appeals to people of all ages.
The Office is at the top of the mountain for workplace sitcoms. It's the show that every other workplace sitcom aspires to be. Based on a British sitcom of the same name, The Office took the cringe-worthy humor of the original series and infused it with a lighter tone and characters you can't help but love.
What makes The Office so beloved by generations of people is the sincere heart at the show's center. While Michael Scott (Steve Carell) may be a needy, inappropriate boss, you can tell that he means well and truly cares about his employees like they're his family. Jim and Pam's (John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer) office romance is one of the sweetest relationships ever put to screen. Even though they all have their differences and feuds, every employee of the Scranton branch of Dunder-Mifflin will always be closer and more intimate than friends and co-workers.
Chance Morgan made a decision at a young age to forego having friends and a social life in order to prepare for a career writing about movies and TV. He stuck to that decision whether he wanted to or not. Now, after graduating from the prestigious University of Alabama, Chance spends most of his time putting that training to use. When he is not watching and/or writing about movies and TV, you can probably catch Chance listening to countless podcasts about movies and TV.
And you thought Michael Scott made people uncomfortable.
Every episode of Avatar was imaginative, so the strangest ones really came out of left field...
With Season 2 coming, let's look at 'House of the Dragon's best characters.","From the genre's origins with The Mary Tyler Moore Show to modern smash hits like Abbott Elementary, here are the most hilarious workplace comedies to grace the small screen.
Too often, the last thing we want to think about after a long day at work is...well...work. But when it comes to charmed escapism, there's nothing quite like a workplace comedy to offer a healthy dose of relatability besides a helping of absurdity.
Set everywhere from boring, badly lit offices to bars, newsrooms, and beyond, this specific brand of comedy is a tried-and-true reminder that a solid group of colleagues can make all the difference in getting you through the workday — even if it means putting up with silly pranks, delusional egos, or down-right silly situations. Here's EW's list of the best workplace comedies, in chronological order from the genre's genesis to today's instant classics.
In order to dive into the origins of workplace comedies, you can't overlook The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Not only is this groundbreaking sitcom heartwarming and easy to watch, but the jokes, zingers, and gags are just as good today as they were when it first aired back in 1970.
Mary Tyler Moore plays Mary Richards, a 30-year-old, freshly single career woman who moves to Minneapolis to pursue her dream of making it big in television. She lands a role as an associate producer for the city's lowest-rated station, and it quickly devolves into one hilarious problem to solve after another for her prickly boss, Lou Grant (Ed Asner), co-workers, and friends before she finally sticks the landing. Seeing Betty White flex her comedic chops as flirtatious ""Happy Homemaker"" Sue Ann Nivens is also a treat, and Betty Ford made history as the first First Lady in a television sitcom with her cameo in the season 6 episode ""The Seminar.""
Even though this workplace sitcom aired in the late-1970s and early-1980s, the performances by comedic OGs like Danny DeVito (as tyrannical dispatcher Louie De Palma), Christopher Lloyd (as burnout ""Reverend Jim"" Ignatowski), and Andy Kaufman (as lovable mechanic Latka Gravas) hold up to this day.
Taxi worked so well not because it focused on the inner workings of the fictional Sunshine Cab Company garage, set in the heart of NYC, but because it highlighted the humor found in the everyday plights of the cabbies as they pursued their hopes and dreams — even if they didn't always pan out according to plan.
Over 11 seasons, Ted Danson served up drinks and laughs galore as hunky Red Sox relief pitcher-turned-bartender Sam Malone in this sitcom set in Boston's famous real-life watering hole, Cheers. Along with co-workers like bright-eyed Diane (Shelley Long) and cynical Carla (Rhea Perlman), as well as regular barflies Norm (George Wendt) and Cliff (John Ratzenberger), the tight-knit crew navigated whatever came through the door during happy hour and beyond.
Classic episodes like ""Diane's Perfect Date"" and ""Thanksgiving Orphans"" are still relevant today, and a slew of future stars like Woody Harrelson, Kelsey Grammer, and Kirstie Alley found their way into the basement-level bar where everybody knows your name.
This one's for the underdogs, as NewsRadio explores the office relationships and behind-the-scenes mayhem that can happen at what should be a slow and sober radio station. We see Everyman Dave Nelson (Dave Foley) take the top job at WNYX, the second-place AM broadcasting station in NYC, as the new director. Dave arrives with big ideas to help elevate the station, but he ends up spending more time wrangling his subordinates, namely anchors Bill McNeal (Phil Hartman in his final role) and Catherine Duke (Khandi Alexander), and the station's owner Jimmy James (Stephen Root), into submission — though it's often to no avail.
Fast-paced quips, heaps of satire, and a dash of surrealism help keep the show fun to watch, and Joe Rogan of all people popped up (or even down from the ceiling) as the station's electrician, making for some silly slapstick that still provides chuckles to this day.
If you've ever had to take a job because you absolutely had to, you're sure to laugh at Just Shoot Me!'s relatable workplace comedy. When Maya Gallo (Laura San Giacomo) gets herself fired over an on-air prank, she's forced to go to work for her father's fashion magazine, Blush, as a writer.
There's tons of friction between Maya and her co-workers, including former model Nina (Wendie Malick), flirtatious photographer Elliot (Enrico Colantoni), and acid-tongued assistant Dennis (David Spade) — and they got into all kinds of hijinks and misunderstandings over seven seasons. Even if high fashion isn't your thing, watching the snark and snide fly in this office is sure to tickle your funny bone.
Hospitals may seem like no laughing matter, but Scrubs managed to challenge the doom and bloom so common in the medical field with a brilliant buddy workplace comedy. Through the eyes of J.D. (Zach Braff), viewers got an education in what it takes for medical students — namely his best friend Turk (and real-life bestie Donald Faison), on-and-off love interest Elliot (Sarah Chalke), and sassy RN Carla (Judy Reyes) — to succeed at Sacred Heart Hospital and survive the excruciating tutelage of the irritable Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley).
While there were definitely some tear-jerker moments, the core of this show is all about quick-witted jokes, over-the-top daydreams (who can forget the ""My Musical"" episode?), and learning to love your work family no matter what.
Though often politically incorrect, Reno 911!, a long-running parody of the reality show Cops, is undeniably a Comedy Central gem. The mockumentary-style series shows the often overwhelming incompetence of the Reno Sheriff's Department, led by Lt. Jim Dangle (creator Thomas Lennon), from their morning briefings to their attempts to catch a string of memorable crooks on the streets.
Adding to the stellar performances of the core cast — which includes Cedric Yarbrough, Niecy Nash, and Kerri Kenney-Silver — are loads of appearances by comedy greats, like Patton Oswalt and Keegan-Michael Key, as petty criminals. Reno 911! has even garnered enough laughs over the years that it's spawned three movies and a revival on Quibi, which then moved to the Roku Channel amidst that streamer's fall from grace.
NBC's The Office is one of the most beloved, infinitely rewatchable workplace comedies of all time. Inspired by Ricky Gervais' British mockumentary-style sitcom of the same name, The Office was at its best with Steve Carell's often clueless but lovable Michael Scott at the helm of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company's Scranton branch as he led a pitch-perfect ensemble cast of relatable, everyday office workers (including breakout stars Rainn Wilson and John Krasinski) through the daily grind of a mundane 9-to-5.
There are pranks and romances among co-workers, team-building trips, and, of course, ""Training Day"" exercises that don't quite go as planned. It's a must-see for those who know first-hand how easily a typical office can slide into innocent (for the most part) chaos — and it's one of the greatest workplace comedies to date.
The word ""work"" is admittedly a stretch when it comes to this game-changing workplace comedy series, but there's no doubt that ""the Gang"" behind Paddy's Pub is among the funniest groups of co-workers on this list.
Together, Mac (Rob McElhenney), Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Charlie (Charlie Day), Sweet Dee (Kaitlin Olson), and Frank (Danny DeVito) consistently find themselves in downright outlandish and cringe-worthy misadventures, almost always because of their own schemes and narcissism, but we just can't look away as they stoop to new lows each season. While episodes like ""Gun Fever,"" ""The D.E.N.N.I.S. System,"" and ""The Gang Goes on Family Fight"" are standouts for their laugh-out-loud moments, trust us, nearly every episode is brilliant.
As far as workplaces go, few seem to be as much fun as at a television studio, and 30 Rock doesn't fail to make that seem like reality. The brainchild of Mean Girls creator Tina Fey, the show satirizes her experiences working on Saturday Night Live — and we should all be grateful for this award-winning peek behind the curtain.
The series follows sketch-comedy writer and showrunner Liz Lemon (played by Fey) as she's forced to work with Alec Baldwin's slick network president Jack Donaghy and keep chaos from breaking out between costars Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan). Over seven seasons, Liz did her best to maintain order in Studio 6H at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, but we were happy to watch every bit of mischief and mayhem until the show's particularly great finale.
""Are we having fun yet?"" Even without the 2023 revival, the zany ensemble cast of the original two seasons more than earns this show a spot on our list. Party Down follows a mix of would-be writers and actors chasing their dreams in Hollywood while they support themselves by working for a swanky catering company.
In each episode, the crew, led by Adam Scott's perpetually pessimistic Henry Pollard, works a new event — and there are some real doozies, like the ""Sin Say Shun Awards After Party"" and ""Steve Guttenberg's Birthday."" A source of big laughs, Party Down is perfect to binge when you need an escape after a long day on the job.
You'd be hard-pressed to find a more optimistic (or waffle-loving) co-worker than Amy Poehler's Leslie Knope, who, over seven seasons, did everything she could to inspire her co-workers at a small Indiana parks department into believing that anything's possible — especially building a certain community park.
Even in the face of her government-loathing boss, Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman in the role he was arguably born for), Leslie persevered in laughable fashion. While it starts off a little shaky, Parks and Recreation finds its footing by balancing a winning mix of comedic styles, like Aubrey Plaza's deadpan loathing of (almost) everything and Aziz Ansari's self-centered neurosis, which was best displayed in the season 4 episode ""Pawnee Rangers"" when he showed us just what it means to ""Treat Yo' Self."" It's a fun workplace romp that keeps us laughing from its humble beginnings to its satisfying ending.
Not only is Archer an example of adult animation at its finest — featuring an instantly recognizable visual style and wicked smart writing — it's also an exceptional workplace comedy that leans into occupational hazards head-on. Self-described super spy Sterling Archer (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) works for his boss/mother Malory Archer (the late, great Jessica Walter) as she runs an offbeat crew of sometimes inept intelligence agents: Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell), Ray Gillette (Adam Reed), Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer), and Dr. Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates).
The show pokes fun at all things espionage, like feuding with the KGB and tinkering with the latest technological toys, as the team goes everywhere from the South Pacific to Europe to the bottom of the sea to an international space station. Among the fire fights, there's mystery, mischief, and even a few standalone anthology seasons — like season 8: Dreamland — that are downright fantastic. What's not to love?
This award-winning parody of classic police procedurals was such a hit with fans that it was successfully saved (by said fans) from premature cancellation. Set in a fictional Brooklyn police precinct, Andy Samberg's comedic muscles get a workout playing cocky detective Jake Peralta, who is just as interested in slacking off with his co-workers as he is in solving cases, much to the dismay of his boss, the so, so serious Capt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher).
Eager-to-please detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), tightly-wound Sgt. Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), deadpan detective Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz), and self-absorbed office manager Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti) round out the squad, each contributing their own comedic style in one of the most feel-good workplace series in recent memory.
Superstore is for anyone who's been subjected to working in the weird world of big-box retail. However, even those who have been lucky enough to avoid working a cash register or stocking shelves will find themselves laughing at the series and the sticky situations that Amy (America Ferrera) and her merry band of shift workers get into.
Set almost entirely in the St. Louis outpost of the fictional chain store Cloud 9, this fun, laid-back comedy tackles everything you'd expect to find at a megastore, including impossible-to-handle customers and super-sized sales. Superstore also stood out for its ability to blend real-world issues, like the COVID-19 pandemic in the season 6 premiere, which EW deemed the ""high for the series"" in our A-rated review.
A failing Philly public school isn't the obvious choice for a sitcom setting, but, as Quinta Brunson's Abbott Elementary proves, it's the right choice. A mockumentary-style comedy fusing the best parts of The Office's workplace culture and romances with Ted Lasso's purity and can-do attitude, Abbott Elementary tells the story of a group of teachers at an underfunded inner-city school, struggling to do right by their students with the limited resources available to them.
Starring Brunson, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Tyler James Williams, Lisa Ann Walter, Chris Perfetti, and Janelle James as the school's staff and administrators, Abbott is charming, laugh-out-loud funny, and boasts one of the best cold open bits of 2022.",Collider,Ew,,,

You can’t get more classic than Night of the Living Dead. George A Romero’s 1968 epic not only kicked off the entire zombie genre, but did so with a sharp eye for social commentary that still hits home. Romero would later expand his vision with Dawn and Day of the Dead (the latter of which is also on HBO Max), but there is something special about the claustrophobic terror of this first entry. Night of the Living Dead throws viewers into a situation that must be dealt with long before it gets understood. It’s a bleak film, too. The various survival schemes its characters concoct feel hopeless before they even begin, but there’s not much you’d be able to do differently in their situation, which is what makes it all so terrifying.
Many define Twin Peaks by its central mystery. Or perhaps it’s the memory of Dale Cooper, praising a perfect cup of coffee. Or maybe it’s the surreal imagery of the Black Lodge that stays with you. The horror of it often gets overlooked. Fire Walk With Me fans beg to differ. Freed from the confines of television, David Lynch goes all-out here, telling the horrific story of Laura Palmer’s murder. It is surreal, yes. It never bothers to hold your hand, and even if you study it intensely, you won’t find an answer for everything. But the darkness of the imagery and the nightmarish details of Lynch’s world will definitely haunt you long after the movie ends.
In addition to writing for /Film and Collider, Evan's probably best known for his time as Senior Editor of Birth.Movies.Death. His passions include dumb action movies, not-dumb action movies, Shakespeare, and Tyler Perry. While he claims to understand that people don't always get what they want, he nevertheless believes it would be “cool” if he could become more like Danny DeVito with age.
You won't be able to look away.

What happens to our trio of cosmic-powered heroines?","From serial killers to witches, monsters, and bloodsuckers, here's your guide to the scariest horror movies on Max right now — and why they give us the creeps.
Looking for movies to give you the chills? Max (the rebranded streaming service that now houses content previously available on HBO Max and Discovery+) is the home for many of the scariest horror movies in cinema history. From genre-defining classics like The Exorcist to modern favorites such as Malignant, here's our guide to the best horror films on Max, as of February 2024.
Shy outcast Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is mercilessly mocked by her high-school peers in this horror classic, adapted from Stephen King's first novel. Little do they know that she possesses telekinetic powers, and when she finally uses them to seek revenge on the bullies who wronged her, she makes their prom a night to remember, indeed. Featuring a sensitive turn from Spacek and a haunting Piper Laurie as Carrie's dangerously religious mother, Carrie remains a classic not only for its fiery prom scene and horror imagery but for its allegory of a girl growing up in small-town America. After all, discovering you have telekinetic powers is nothing compared to the terrors of high school — and those that await you at home. —K.J.
Despite positive reviews upon its release, few could have predicted that this supernatural horror film would launch a billion-dollar franchise. At the same time, the first Conjuring film has a winning formula for modern-day horror, combining demonic spirits, jump scares, and a chilling based-on-a-true-story hook. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are summoned to a seemingly haunted Rhode Island farmhouse in the hope of warding off a demon. While multiple sequels and spin-offs have spawned in the years since, nothing matches The Conjuring in providing genuine, classic horror for an era of jaded moviegoers. —K.J.
The debut feature from Guillermo del Toro, Cronos tells the story of an older man (Federico Luppi) who discovers a mystical amulet that gives him a more energized, youthful demeanor — at a cost. The film explores mortality, addiction, and family with a story that fuses vampirism with Cronenbergian body horror. Cronos marries crowd-pleasing horror elements with highbrow filmmaking sensibilities into ""an art-house flick that would be equally at home in the grind house,"" as EW's Chris Nashawaty wrote in his review. ""Part Hellraiser, part The Name of the Rose… Cronos' shocks may be few, but its raw, bare-bones F/X and deliberate pacing make it a refreshing alternative to the typical Hollywood bloodsucker."" —W.S.
In David Lynch's debut feature, a young man (Jack Nance) struggles to adapt to fatherhood as he cares for his unusual baby in a black-and-white, industrially dismaying world. The film is a harrowing, surreal dream of young adult anxiety, tensely contemplating marriage and parenting with off-kilter sets and swirling sound design that enhance the film's discomfort. As Lynch's career has evolved, his first film has gained a strong cult following, and many filmmakers cite it as a favorite, including Gretel & Hansel director Osgood Perkins. ""Eraserhead is the most disturbing, beautiful, textural, silent nightmare that I think has ever been made,"" Perkins told EW in an interview. ""I don't think that they will make another one like that any time soon."" —W.S.
This fifth entry in the Evil Dead film series tested so well that Warner Bros. opted to release it in theaters rather than its intended streaming-only release. The jump-scare-laden film follows Beth (Lily Sullivan) as she visits her sister Ellie (Alyssa Sutherland) and Ellie's kids, one of whom has inadvertently summoned the demonic Deadites. Ellie is soon possessed and attacks her family, leading to terrifying consequences. Like some of the best horror films, Evil Dead Rise deals in themes of motherhood, drawing genuine scares from Ellie threatening the lives of her own children. It's horrifying and gory in the grand tradition of the Evil Dead franchise, and you won't get that ""Mommy's with the maggots now"" line out of your head. —K.J.
Based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, William Friedkin's The Exorcist follows an actress (Ellen Burstyn) as she goes to extreme lengths to cure her young daughter (Linda Blair) of apparent demonic possession. The film also stars Max von Sydow and Jason Miller as Catholic priests who attempt to exorcise the evil within. The Exorcist marked a turning point for explicitly grotesque material in mainstream American entertainment. With infamously nasty flashes of gore, bodily fluids, and profanity, the film provided unprecedented disgust for morbidly curious audiences. ""What The Exorcist really gave rise to was a demon of entertainment, an impulse of titillating blatancy that has bedeviled and outraged audiences ever since,"" an EW critic wrote in a 2000 retrospective. —W.S.
As most fans of the genre know, critical reception for horror films doesn't always get it right initially. Such is the case with Eyes Without a Face, which met a chilly response in its initial release in 1960 but has since earned a reputation as one of the best French horror films ever made. Pierre Brasseur plays Dr. Génessier, a physician racked with guilt over causing his daughter's disfigurement in a car accident. His guilt manifests in kidnapping young women, removing their faces through surgery, and attempting to transplant them onto his daughter. The haunting film may not have traditional jump scares but its disturbing plot is straight out of a Gothic fairy tale. No wonder Guillermo del Toro rates it as his favorite horror movie. —K.J.
This Swedish silent film examines the history of witchcraft through a combination of documentary-style explanation and dramatized segments. It's partially inspired by director Benjamin Christensen's research on the German text Malleus Maleficarum, a guide to witchcraft for inquisitors looking to persecute its perpetrators. Häxan is so informative that it plays out like a brilliant college lecture, yet there's also immense artistry in all of its narrative moments. Thanks largely to gorgeous costumes and set designs, the beautifully grotesque renderings of witches and demons during the film's surreal moments are absolutely jaw-dropping, even if you think you're averse to silent movies (or the occult). The whole project ties together as a powerful critique of modern mental health stigmas and sexism, as history's witch hunts were byproducts of multiple layers of prejudice and misunderstanding. —W.S.
Family trauma is taken to extreme new levels in Ari Aster's auspicious horror debut. Toni Collette stars as Annie, a miniaturist grieving the death of her mother and whose family is subsequently haunted by a demonic presence. As she and her loved ones are plagued by misfortune after misfortune, Annie comes to understand how her deceased mother may have something to do with this curse. Filled with a perpetual state of dread, Hereditary is a genuinely unnerving experience, with Collette delivering a master class, should-have-been-Oscar-nominated performance at its center. As EW's critic wrote, ""She's amazing, grounding what most people might dismiss as just a 'scary movie' with real dramatic power and force."" —K.J.
A group of schoolgirls try to escape a demonic haunted house in this cult classic from Japan. The film from Nobuhiko Obayashi is as much a comedy as it is a horror movie, as the supernatural scares are so ridiculous and unpredictable that you can't help but laugh at the film's over-the-top style. House experiments with tons of surreal techniques that make the film feel like a bizarre dream — there are wacky transitions, stylized backdrops, bursts of stop-motion and hand-drawn animation, wild color filters, jarring soundtrack choices, and dizzying camera movements. Obayashi conceived of the film through conversations with his young daughter, who brought an unusual childlike perspective to his conception of a horror film. As a result, House is unlike any movie you've ever seen, and you're not likely to forget some of its most daring imagery. —W.S.
Speaking of films that were misunderstood at the time, Karyn Kusama's horror comedy has aged remarkably well since its 2009 release. Amanda Seyfried stars as Needy, a high school student whose popular best friend, Jennifer (a never-better Megan Fox), becomes possessed by a demon. After Jennifer kills multiple male classmates, Needy hopes to put an end to the violence, while also trying to get to the bottom of what exactly happened to her best friend. Though critics largely dismissed Jennifer's Body as disposable in 2009 (and audiences weren't much kinder), it has since earned cult classic status for its feminist themes; what was marketed at the time as a sexy dark comedy for teen boys to ogle at is actually an ahead-of-its-time revenge thriller. —K.J.
Masaki Kobayashi, director of Harakiri and The Human Condition trilogy, crafted this three-hour anthology film, which tells four unrelated ghost stories based on the collections of writer Lafcadio Hearn. They're mysterious folktales that meditate on love, loyalty, and storytelling, where clear moral lessons are extracted from puzzling worlds. Kwaidan has a lot to offer besides its nightmarish atmosphere, delving into romantic tragedy, war narratives, and fantasy. It boasts incredible, hyper-stylized production design, with surreal backdrops and painterly attention to detail in every frame, and is scored by fantastic, disorienting music from composer Tōru Takemitsu, which, at its best moments, makes you feel as though you're being hypnotized. —W.S.
Saw and The Conjuring filmmaker James Wan returns to his horror roots with this underseen gem, in which a woman (Annabelle Wallis) investigates a mysterious string of killings around Seattle. The film teases elements from numerous horror subgenres, including haunted house stories, psychological thrillers, and slashers, before eventually delivering a gonzo third-act twist that transforms the movie into a bloody action spectacle. Wan created Malignant to cleanse his palette after making two billion-dollar blockbusters in a row — Furious 7 and Aquaman. ""There's only so many PG-13 movies I can make before I get bored of that,"" Wan told EW. ""I wanted to go back to the kind of movies I used to make."" —W.S.
A fine-dining restaurant is the setting for some revenge in this delectable comedic horror-thriller. The Menu centers on an eclectic group of hand-selected guests enjoying a private dinner at renowned chef Julian Slowik's (Ralph Fiennes) upscale island restaurant. But things quickly take a turn as Julian reveals exactly why he's assembled this particular group together, with each new course becoming more dangerous than the last. The wildcard in all of this is Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy), the only uninvited guest of the night, who throws a wrench into Julian's wicked plans. The Menu is an unpredictable, wild ride that fits in nicely with The White Lotus and Parasite as satirical class conflicts attuned to our time. ""If we cannot eat the rich,"" wrote EW's critic of the film, ""at least we can enjoy their suffering on screen with a side of fermented sea lettuce and light schadenfreude."" —K.J.
Grossing nearly $200 million worldwide on a budget of only $15,000, Paranormal Activity is reported to be the most profitable film of all time. But its impact extends beyond box office receipts, as its simple found-footage concept spawned numerous imitators trying to cash in on the trend. Few could replicate its authentic scares, though, telling the story of Katie (Katie Featherston), a young woman haunted by a demonic presence since childhood. She gets her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) to set up a camera in their bedroom to record any strange occurrences that happen while they're sleeping, after which point Katie's claims are confirmed. From startling noises to full-on possession, Paranormal Activity lives up to its reputation as one of the scarier horror films released this century. ""With its this-is-really-happening vibe, Paranormal Activity scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clichés,"" wrote EW's critic. ""The fear is real, all right, because the fear is really in you."" —K.J.
All these years later, the lambs still haven't stopped screaming, even if they have for Clarice. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins each deservedly won Oscars for their performances in this unforgettable psychological thriller, with their Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter ranking as one of the best heroes and villains, respectively, in movie history. The film follows FBI trainee Clarice as she interviews notorious criminal mastermind/cannibal Hannibal Lecter for help in tracking down another serial killer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). The Silence of the Lambs got under the skin of moviegoers in 1991 and it still finds a way to do so with audiences today, thanks to Hopkins' chilling portrayal and the disturbing nature of its story. —K.J.
When a Staten Island journalist (Jennifer Salt) witnesses a murder next door, she unfurls a dizzying mystery involving conjoined twins, a mental hospital, and a corpse stuffed in a couch. Sisters is an excellent showcase for director Brian De Palma's unmistakable filmmaking style, as he employs dazzling split-screen compositions, impressive long takes, and complex camerawork to maximize the precision and clarity of the on-screen action. Like many of De Palma's other films, it feels heavily indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, drawing inspiration from Psycho, Rope, and Rear Window, while also featuring a score from Bernard Herrmann. Yet, its scariest scene — inspired by the unforgettable dream sequence in Rosemary's Baby — is a surreal flashback/hallucination that'll make your skin crawl. —W.S.
No one does dread quite like David Lynch, and this prequel film to Twin Peaks is a particularly haunting experience — even for him. The original series begins with the discovery of Laura Palmer's body, wrapped in plastic, while Fire Walk With Me recounts the seven days leading up to her death. In a tour de force performance, Sheryl Lee reprises her role as Laura, whose homecoming queen popularity shields a tormented personal life, made further tragic by the men who abuse her — one of whom is her own father. It is undoubtedly a difficult watch, and while the film has its fair share of Lynchian dream logic, it is also one that speaks to the senseless tragedies of our world. —K.J.
This enigmatic sci-fi horror indie is a testament to the power of film as a visual medium. Unfolding with minimal dialogue, Under the Skin — described by EW's critic as ""an avant-garde experiment that throws narrative storytelling out the window in favor of mood, mystery, and monotony"" — finds Scarlett Johansson playing an unnamed alien woman in Scotland who targets men, luring them into her house and immersing them into a mysterious black void. The film cleverly flips the traditional gender roles of men preying on women, while also serving as a quietly stirring story of an alien discovering what it means to be human. —K.J.
Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer followed up his acclaimed The Passion of Joan of Arc with this transfixing early vampire film. Vampyr focuses on a young man and occultist (Nicolas de Gunzburg) who attempts to free a French village from the curse of a bloodthirsty fiend. Though the project was produced during the sound era, Dreyer still employed many silent film techniques to make it more accessible. The film features very little dialogue and still uses title cards. This also isn't a plot-heavy movie — instead, it elegantly builds a terrifying, dreamlike atmosphere through a series of hauntingly gorgeous images and surreal shots that'll stick with you long after the film ends. It's an exemplary mood piece that lulls you into a confounding trance as you try to make sense of its brooding imagery. —W.S.
While most of Max's horror offerings contain old-school terrors, We're All Going to the World's Fair is of a decidedly newer age. Anyone who's spent too much time browsing the dark corners of the internet will recognize in this low-budget film the unique feeling of dread from which you can't look away, telling the story of Casey (Anna Cobb), a teenage girl who takes the online World's Fair Challenge. The challenge requires her to record herself reciting ""I want to go to the World's Fair"" three times, smear blood on her computer screen, and wait to see the effect it will have on her in the days to come. As she starts to exhibit strange behavior, she posts videos online that get the attention of a concerned user. Like the best online creepypasta, the line between fact and fiction is blurred, leaving it up to the viewer to decide what's really going on with Casey. —K.J.
Robert Eggers' slow-burning debut feature The Witch tracks the misfortune and misery of a Puritan family in 17th-century New England, where they experience inexplicable terrors that may have supernatural origins (and may be picking them off one by one). The film stars Anya Taylor-Joy as the family's eldest child along with Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie as her parents. Eggers strove for authenticity in his recreation of early colonial life, going to great lengths to study and adapt the foreignness of the characters' dialect and lifestyle, which makes it feel as though you're watching actual historical events. What's more, Taylor-Joy was so disturbed by the script that it impacted her sleep: ""The words gripped my heart with an icy cold hand,"" she told EW. ""I didn't sleep a wink."" —W.S.",Collider,Ew,,,

Members of the wizarding world both past and present showed up at the premiere of Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore on Tuesday — including the franchise's controversial writer J.K. Rowling.
The Harry Potter creator joined cast members like Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, and Jude Law at the world premiere for the Fantastic Beasts sequel, walking the red carpet at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Original Draco Malfoy actor Tom Felton was also in attendance, as was new cast member Mads Mikkelsen, who's making his debut as villain Grindelwald after taking over the role from Johnny Depp.
Rowling's attendance comes after the author sat out HBO Max's Return to Hogwarts anniversary special earlier this year. Original Harry Potter stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint all participated in the 20th anniversary special, but Rowling only appeared in archival footage. At the time, sources told EW that Rowling was invited to participate, but her team determined that archived comments from the writer were adequate.
Rowling has become a polarizing figure for Potter fans, making repeated comments that many have labeled as harmful to the trans community. The author herself has denied being transphobic, but LGBTQ organizations like GLAAD and the Trevor Project have denounced her comments as harmful rhetoric, while franchise actors like Radcliffe and Redmayne have spoken out against Rowling's views.
Missing from the Secrets of Dumbledore premiere was star Ezra Miller, who returns to the franchise as Credence, a.k.a. Aurelius Dumbledore, after appearing in both the original Fantastic Beasts and The Crimes of Grindelwald. Miller was arrested Sunday night in Hawaii for disorderly conduct and harassment. Miller, who uses they/them pronouns, was arrested by South Hilo patrol officers and charged, and they were released after posting $500 bail.
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore hits theaters April 15. See the full gallery of premiere attendees below.","After her notable absence from the recent “Harry Potter” reunion special, J.K. Rowling attended the premiere of “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore” on Tuesday at The Royal Festival Hall in London.
When “Harry Potter” stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint reunited earlier this year for the HBO Max special “Return to Hogwarts,” which celebrated the 20th anniversary of “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” Rowling decided to sit out. While the author and franchise creator was invited to participate in the reunion, she declined, causing HBO Max to use archival footage of Rowling from 2019 instead.
Rowling is a co-screenwriter and producer of “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,” which is the third installment of the “Harry Potter” spinoff franchise. The film premieres on April 15 in the United States.
A polarizing figure, Rowling has been outspoken on social media about her views on transgender people and opposition to laws that make it easier for trans people to legally change their genders. While Rowling has expressed “trans lives matter” in the past, she has been linked to the TERF (Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists) movement, which generally supports the claim that trans women are not women.
Also absent from the premiere was Ezra Miller, who stars in the movie as Credence Barebone. On Monday, Miller was arrested by law enforcement in Hilo, Hawaii, and charged for disorderly conduct and harassment after an incident at a bar.
“Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore” also stars Mads Mikkelsen, Katherine Waterston, Jude Law, Eddie Redmayne, Alison Sudol, Dan Fogler and Callum Turner.

0.3333333333333333,"We're craving answers to this ambiguous ending!
Editor's Note: The following contains spoilers for Seasons 1-2 of the HBO Max series Starstruck.Season 2 of the HBO Max rom-com series Starstruck dropped on March 24, and left fans with yet another tantalizing cliffhanger ending. The series, imported from the UK, follows Jessie (Rose Matafeo, also the show's creator and writer), a 28-year-old navigating adulthood and two part-time jobs she actually kind of hates in London. In Season 1, she had a one-night stand with a cute guy, Tom (Nikesh Patel), whom she met at a bar on New Year's Eve. When she woke up at his place the next morning, she discovered he was actually a famous movie star. An on-again, off-again relationship ensued, exploring both Jessie's and Tom's insecurities as they tried to make it work while he's on movie sets and attending premieres, and she's working at the local cinema and as a nanny, though she loses the nanny job in Season 1.
Season 1 left us with Jessie deciding to move back to her native New Zealand, and Tom heading to Ireland for a few months to film a new movie. Tom opted to ride the bus with her to the airport, but when Jessie's stop came up, she stayed on the bus with Tom. And that's exactly where Season 2 picks up.
At first giddy about her decision to stay, Jessie soon has a minor freakout about not going back home, since her mother changed the sheets in the guest room and everything. And that's what makes this show so great and relatable. Even though Tom is a well-known actor, you can empathize with what he's going through and what Jessie's going through as she tries to build a relationship with him. It's the little things, like guests at Tom's birthday party assuming she's a waiter and Jessie feeling guilt about missing Christmas with her family because her mom made the effort to change the guest room sheets. Oh, and she booked a flight to the other side of the world, and then purposely missed that flight, which is a lot of money for us non-celebrity types.
Jessie and Tom face their first major hurdle when Tom, for reasons known only to Tom, purchases a ticket to New Zealand for Jessie ""just in case"" and ""as a joke."" After this ripple, which Jessie quickly forgives him for, the two settle in for a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship that has its ups and downs, such as Tom's family and colleagues saying Jessie ""must have a great personality"" because they're used to him dating fellow actors and models. But the ultimate test comes when Jessie sees her ex-boyfriend, Ben (Edward Easton), at his nan's funeral. The two rekindle something, which Jessie seems to think is friendship and Ben knows all along is his master plan of winning her back.
Before long, Ben's plan succeeds, and he tears Tom and Jessie apart. They break up, and no amount of screaming ""nooooo!"" at the TV screen will stop them from doing so. By the time we get to Episode 6, the season finale, Jessie and Tom have been broken up for three months, and she and Ben are seeing each other again.
In the meantime, Jessie's friends, Steve (Nic Sampson) and Sarah (Lola-Rose Maxwell), have become engaged, and the season finale focuses almost entirely on their joint hen/stag party. Steve has planned an all-day affair, and upon arriving to the first stop, a miniature golf game, Jessie finds that he's invited Tom to join in the festivities. Ben is also there, as he's Steve's best man.
Awkwardness, and Jessie's realization that she made a mistake by breaking up with Tom, ensues. Throughout the day, through laser tag and karaoke and finally, a boat trip across a pond, Tom and Jessie manage to have a couple of conversations, and it's clear that neither of them really wanted to break up with the other. They maintain that they'd like to be friends, but we all know they want more than that, right?
The laser tag incident proves that right away, as after Tom ""shoots"" Jessie as part of the game, they share a brief, but powerful, kiss. And then she finally realizes that she shouldn't be with Ben, either. Although Tom apologizes for the kiss, because he's just that kind of sweet, adorable guy, Jessie still thankfully ends things with Ben.
For the final event of the day, as the gang separates into boats by gender, Jessie's girlfriends question her about Tom, and why they broke up in the first place. Through this conversation, with Joe (Joe Barnes) included as well, because there were more guys than girls, the friends tell Jessie the tough-love truth: she wasn't ready to be in a relationship. She was a commitment-phobe, and sabotaged her relationship with Tom, just as Ben had done with her, when they were together before.
""Oh my God, I've Ben-ed Tom!"" Jessie exclaims. It's at this moment, she realizes what she's done, and she jumps from the boat, wading across the pond to Tom's boat, even as her friends keep yelling that she can't swim. It's all very chaotic as both boats erupt into yells and excited chatter, but they quiet down when Jessie reaches Tom's boat. It's there that she declares her love for him, and of course, he jumps out of his own boat to meet her, and tells her he loves her, too.
Zoom out, fountain erupts as they kiss, happy ending. But, Tom has committed to film a movie for eight months in Atlanta, and said earlier in the episode that he would be leaving the next week. And he'll be gone for nearly a year. Jessie has no plans to leave London anytime soon, so was this actually a happy ending after all?
There has been no word on a Season 3, but it's easy to see how it could play out. Fans would probably be thrilled to find out how Jessie and Tom navigate a long-distance relationship — or if they even try to. Perhaps they're okay with saying the ""L"" word and then continuing on living separate lives. That's harder to imagine, however.
Other successful British comedies like Fleabag have had two seasons and been done, and in an interview with Radio Times, Matafeo did say, ""I always thought two and out; it’s the British way."" But she does seem open to the possibility of a third season.
Though there's something to be said for ambiguous endings, Starstruck is the kind of series we need to know a definite ending. Jessie and Tom have been through so much already, and have broken up so many times, we almost need a permanent commitment from them both, so we know they'll be okay. Either that, or they finally realize that their relationship will never work in the end, because of all their differences.
That's not the ending any rom-com fan wants, though, is it?

Though fans of the story will be familiar with its beats, they won't have seen it told quite like this.","SPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for the entirety of “Starstruck” Season 2, which is now available to stream on HBO Max.
The first season of “Starstruck” was one of 2021’s most purely delightful TV surprises. Somehow, over six episodes running just 20 minutes each, creator and star Rose Matafeo managed to both embrace and upend the romantic comedy genre with the story of how normal girl Jessie (Matafeo) accidentally slept — and then fell in love — with movie star Tom Kapoor (Nikesh Patel). After a season of ups and downs, its happy ending saw the two decide to stay together despite Jessie buying plane tickets home to New Zealand, Tom’s agent (Minnie Driver) warning him that actors can never date “civilians,” and basically everyone else’s lowered expectations.
The season’s final scene sees Jessie and Tom sitting at the back of a bus peeling away from the airport stop. The music swells, the two turn to each other in stunned joy, and share a relieved kiss. It’s downright lovely — but it could also read as a bit more ominous, given the uncertainty of what might happen next (as is befitting, given its inspiration of “The Graduate”’s notoriously bittersweet finale).
While the first season had plenty of rom-com roadmaps to follow, the second had to find more of its own identity. All Season 1 had to do was show how Jessie and Tom are compatible. Season 2, however, had to figure out how and why these two incredibly different people would choose to stay together. Making things even more surreal was the fact that Season 1, which ends with Jessie and Tom staying on the bus, came out the day before Season 2, which begins with Jessie and Tom leaving the bus, started filming.
And about that same costume: Patel thought he’d be “really clever” by asking wardrobe if he could keep his jacket from that season finale scene without realizing he’d end up needing it again for the premiere, let alone all the Season 2 promos. “I can’t ever wear that jacket again!” he groans.
In the fourth episode, while Tom’s off shooting an indie film with a perfect nightmare of a director (played with obvious relish by Russell Tovey), Jessie reconnects with her ex-boyfriend, Ben (Edward Easton), at his grandmother’s funeral. The longer the day gets, the drunker they get, the more vigorously they play their apparently time-honored game of “Who can fake a faint more convincingly?” The night and episode alike end with her avoiding a kiss by launching herself at the ground so hard she breaks her arm.
Still, Tom’s personality gets more context in the second season, which introduces his parents (Mina Anwar and Sindhu Vee) and brother (Parth Thakerar). In these scenes, it’s clear that Tom’s family has been humbling him his entire life with their blunt assessments of his work and relationships alike.
Once Tom lays it out for her, though, Jessie realizes that she does actually want to be in a relationship with him, after all. And so she makes a bold (read: drunken) decision: to jump out of her rowboat and wade over to Tom’s to make sure he knows it as soon as possible.
Patel fondly describes the experience of making this scene as typical of the “Starstruck” ethos to roll with the punches while staying true to the script. “We had two days on the lake at Victoria Park, and the first day, it was beautiful sunshine. The second day, the weather completely turned,” he remembers. “But actually, it was one of those magic moments where after the initial, like, ‘how are we going to get this done now that it’s raining’ question, they made the weather turning part of the scene.” With Jessie’s grand gesture interrupted by rain, the moment only became more ridiculous and perfectly fitting.
Whether or not this is the end of the road for “Starstruck,” Matafeo is proud of how the show twisted her favorite genre into a new shape. “I don’t think it was ever an intentional thing to flip the trope with, ‘Let’s have a female character in a rom-com who has self confidence and isn’t necessarily looking for fulfillment in a relationship,’” Matafeo says of the way this second season ended up playing out. Then again, as she says, “I think that’s always been the case with the show, though. It’s never been outright, like, ‘I’m such an unlucky loser in love and I need a boyfriend.’ It’s just that love happens to her.” It just so happens that this love comes in the form of a handsome movie star, but hey: Every rom-com needs at least a little fantasy to make it shine, and “Starstruck” sparkled with the best of them.
Seasons 1 and 2 of “Starstruck” are now available to stream on HBO Max.

0.8,"brightcove.createExperiences(); During more than two decades in the spotlight, Selma Blair has seen her share of ups and downs.
On Monday, the actress was removed from an international flight as it landed in Los Angeles following her return from Cancun, Mexico, after taking what appeared to be “a combination of prescription medication with alcohol,” a source told PEOPLE.
This latest incident is just one of many triumphs and setbacks Blair, 43, has experienced both in her multifaceted career and her complicated personal life.
Beyond her professional success, Blair’s personal life at the time was blossoming as well. In January 2004, she married producer Ahmet Zappa (son of musician Frank Zappa) after six months of dating.
She continued to thrive in Hollywood on both television and movie screens, but in 2006 her relationship with Zappa took a hit and the pair divorced that December.
In the following years, Blair continued to solidify herself in Hollywood and in 2010, she began a relationship with fashion designer Jason Bleick. One year later, the couple welcomed their son, Arthur Saint Bleick.
Three months after Blair and Bleick quietly separated in September 2012, photos of the actress surfaced online that spurred concern about her gaunt figure.
Less than a year later, in June 2013, Blair unexpectedly exited a high-profile role in the sitcom Anger Management. Reports poured in that her costar Charlie Sheen, now 50, had personally fired her via text after Blair complained about his work ethic, according to Deadline. Sheen had a different story, telling The Tonight Show host, Jay Leno, 66, that her character was just written out of the show.
Blair remained mostly under the Hollywood radar – relishing her role as a single mom – until February 2016 when she landed the role of Kardashian family matriarch Kris Jenner in the FX miniseries American Crime Story: The People vs. O. J. Simpson, which chronicled Jenner’s late ex Robert Kardashian’s involvement with O.J. Simpson‘s defense team during the Trial of the Century.
As she inched back into the spotlight, sources told PEOPLE that Blair seemed ""happy and healthy"" in the time leading up the holiday in Mexico with Bleick and Arthur, now 4, from which she was returning when she had her mid-air meltdown.
On Tuesday evening, Blair issued an apology for her airplane outburst.
She continued to say that her “saving grace” came with the knowledge that Arthur was with fast asleep with his dad at the time.
And though she has mostly remained private about what led to her unexpected outburst, Blair made a pledge to her friends and family, her fans and to herself with a tweet on Wednesday.

The actress was on a plane with her son returning from Mexico when she experienced an alarming kind of breakdown in which she reportedly started crying and saying, “He burns my private parts. He won’t let me eat or drink. He beats me. He’s going to kill me.” She was taken off the plane on a stretcher, and had reportedly been mixing prescription medication with alcohol. Blair issued an apology the day after the strange scene and now she’s gone on The Talk to explain what happened. She begins by calling herself “someone who should never drink,” but acknowledges she did that day, and then took some kind of medication that didn’t belong to her. “Someone gave me a pill that I thought was something that I had taken before, which I don’t take on a regular basis,” she told the hosts. “It was something completely different. A very bad choice and I had a total psychotic black out.” Blair says she is completely okay now, that she does not drink at all anymore, and seems pretty comfortable being candid about the whole situation. You can see her complete explanation in the video above.

0.3333333333333333,"Based on the deafening cheers that shook the walls of the Paramount Theater in Austin, Texas on Monday, the SXSW Film Festival premiere of “John Wick: Chapter 4” was a rousing success — and that’s before the film had even started. All it took was star Keanu Reeves to step on stage at the behest of director Chad Stahelski for the 1,000-plus audience to erupt in unbridled enthusiasm.
That fervor never waned throughout the film’s epic two-hour-and-49-minute runtime, with booming ovations following the prodigious action sequences in Osaka, Berlin and Paris — and vocal gasps after several major twists.
Stepping onto the stage after the screening, Reeves and Stahelski both seemed pleasantly shell-shocked by the raucous reception.
Reporting on the rest of the post-screening Q&A, however, is a bit of a challenge, as the conversation at times drifted into serious spoiler territory — including Reeves’ answer for his favorite moment in the movie, which elicited a chorus of “Awwwws” from the audience.
Much of the Q&A involved audience members launching into extended tributes to the film’s star. One person asked Reeves if he ever ages.
“Yeah, be careful what you wish for,” Reeves replied.
Another person yelled “Bring back ‘Constantine’,” referencing Reeves’ beloved 2005 DC adaptation.
“I’m trying, man,” the actor said with a sigh.
One of the final questions came from someone who, appropriately, had a puppy with him, who asked if Reeves was planning to appear in the upcoming “John Wick” spin-offs, including the series “The Continental,” due to premiere on Peacock later this year, and “Ballerina” starring Ana de Armas.
Both Reeves and Stahelski seemed unsure of how to answer.
“John Wick: Chapter 4” will open in theaters on March 24.

And he put those skills to test again at the U.S. premiere of John Wick: Chapter 4, the final film in his beloved action series, at South by Southwest. Early into a rowdy post-screening Q&A, Reeves reportedly got his first taste of danger: a fan shouting, “I’ll marry you!” Reeves responded, “Yeah, be careful what you wish for,” per Variety. (And sorry to report: He’s taken.) He didn’t dodge details of the fourth film during the chat, with Variety redacting his favorite part of the movie — which, start speculating, did elicit awws from the audience. He also didn’t shy away when one fan shouted a question about a sequel to his 2005 film Constantine, simply replying, “I’m trying, man.” But when it came time to talk John Wick spinoffs, Reeves did his best to avoid fire, giving a reportedly “tentative” no on his involvement in Peacock series The Continental and Ana de Armas film Ballerina. Then, he did remember, “I have a cameo in Ballerina, that’s true.” He lives to fight another day.

0.7142857142857142,"Heather acts all uncool about a strange, naked man in her vacation house according to the Countess Luann, purveyor of cool.
There are simply an unbelievable amount of words spoken (generally yelled or slurred, actually) by the RHONY women tonight, but you know who I need to hear more from? How about logging a little confessional interview time with that poor chef in Turks and Caicos who thought he’d be making quinoa salads and mixing vodka-waters all week, but instead had to attempt to moisten chia seeds while the flaps of Luann’s The-Dude-robe were whipping him around the face and Heather’s tears were dripping in his freshly squeezed orange juice. Or maybe a word from Manny, the man who thought he’d be hosting a simple bedazzling party for millionaires, and ended up having his open concept living room turned into a war zone and losing all his custom-made coasters in the process. Let’s mix it up!
I’m back in the saddle as your RHONY recapper for one more week and I have to say, I thought every single part of this ridiculous episode—from Ramona getting kicked out of a fight inside a bathroom to Luann stumbling around a kitchen telling her scarred friends to Be Cool My Babies, to watching eight grown women outsource gluing rhinestone hearts onto stretch jeans to their nannies—was hilarious.
My delirious laughter was so constant it felt kind of like when you’re so exhausted from vacation that you just think everything is funny. You know—how you’re always so exhausted after a weeklong vacation with friends to an island where you had a personal chef to cook your meals, a house manager to make sure you weren’t murdered by locals (or their vengeful wives), and a TV network to pay for all of your expenses? You know how that’s always so EXHAUSTING?! Indeed, as exhausting as last week’s rollercoaster of fights about salads and book titles were, this week’s set of fights about cursing and the dos and don’ts of middle-aged recklessness were just plain ludicrous.
As we’ve all known was coming, today is the day that Heather finds an unaccompanied naked man in the room next-door to hers and Luann—Countess of Elegance and defamer of the f-word—tells her to “be cool” about it.
Heather surely reacts in a manner not totally befitting the actual crime here (more befitting of the potential of the crime, perhaps)—if the difference between being angry and being fine with something is one nude Ramona Singer then your argument is probably built on a thin foundation—but, I want to be clear here: If your friend is scared and uncomfortable because of a situation that you brought into her life, then you should apologize for it. Always.
That is not what happens.
Fully banged, partially nude, and not admitting to anything, the women finally head back to the city. Carole meets Bethenny at a lovely tearoom to fill her in on the three blowups that she missed by leaving the trip 18-hours early. They agree that if Ramona had just stayed in bed alongside her nude man after ridding him of what I’m sure was a Hawaiian print shirt, rather than leaving him to pilfer all of her and Heather’s finest ruffled bikini tops, things would have been cool. Bethenny says that Ramona is always trying to act innocent and then does a pretty solid impression of a Dorinda dirty martini blow-up.
That’s right, the Housewives are having a bona fide bedazzling party. Apparently, when the crew went to check out Heather’s new Yummie jean collection, Kristen was hit with a rhinestone-studded lightning bolt of genius: Bedazzle some damn jeans for charity! She calls it a “diamond and denim” party but there are no diamonds involved—there are, however, stick-on rhinestones, hot glue guns, and metallic fabric pens. Break out your pocketbooks, women of New York City!
In between Dorinda gluing the host’s animal-print coasters on the back pockets of her jeans and Ramona arriving with enough belly chains for everybody, the group breaks off in pairs to occasionally yell at one another in the living room. First, Bethenny takes Kristen aside to tell her that she saw that she was talking about her in the press recently and to cut that crap out. Kristen briefly tries to act like whatever she said was actually intended to be nice, but immediately backs down when she realizes that trying to win an argument with Bethenny is a little like trying to make a pair of jeans look better by adding shiny accessories to them: Not impossible, but really not recommended.
Then comes the main event, and boy is it a doozy. In the time between telling Heather to be cool about the naked guy in the house in Turks and Caicos and arriving back in NYC, Luann has decided that not only was Heather entering her room without knocking a total violation of privacy, but that she did it intentionally to try to catch Luann in the act of… sleeping with that dude who ended up being married, I guess? I don’t know, this entire episode could have just been titled, “Grasping at Straws,” which is exactly what Luann and Heather proceed to do as they attempt to assess who was the most violated. Until, suddenly, they remember that this is all Ramona’s fault.
So they march right over to her at the bedazzling table—but before they can get a word out, Ramona just goes, “Heather, in hindsight, you are so right and I am so sad and sorry that I upset you,” and adds to Luann that she sent Heather to her because, well, she was tired and she didn’t want to talk about it. Earlier, Dorinda said she freaked out on Heather about the f-word that night at dinner because she hadn’t gotten to nap that day. So—it seems that when it comes to addressing the arguments of college sophomores on Spring Break… while at a party that features the activities of a sixth grade sleepover… the women of RHONY are willing to settle for the excuses of cranky toddlers. Whatever works, ladies, you just keep up the good work.
What did you think of tonight’s round of battles? Was Heather being uncool or would you have freaked out if you found some dude with his turks-and-caicos out in your adjoining room too? Will Luann ever realize that she can’t just pick and choose the things that she deems worthy to be judged or not now that she’s a modern-day single woman?","""So what if I had a man in my room? I'm a grown woman,"" countered the Countess before she delivered the line of the season: ""Be cool. Don't be, like, all uncool""
Tuesday’s episode of The Real Housewives of New York City was the moment fans have been waiting for all season.
Who was the naked man sleeping in the room next to Heather Thomson in the wives’ drama-filled Turks and Caicos vacation?
Did LuAnn de Lesseps make out with a married man?
And did Ramona Singer sleep with a mystery man?
“It scared me,” said Thomson, who revealed she sleeps naked.
“They’re mad because we had fun?” the Countess asked Singer, who avoided the fuss by staying in bed.
“I’m coppin’ to it totally,” the Countess said when asked if she might have made out with one of the men – before being told by Kristen Taekman that he was married.

0.4444444444444444,"Despite the expert dancing skills he has shown off in movies like Step Up and Magic Mike, Channing Tatum was at a loss when he was asked to tap dance (and sing!) for the upcoming Coen brothers-directed film Hail, Caesar!.
In the film, Tatum plays a Gene Kelly-type actor who is working on a sailor musical and thus has a long musical number in which he and his shipmates sing and dance around a pub.
The 35-year-old actor confesses that he wasn’t too worried about nailing the singing portion of his role.
The tap dancing, however, was a different story.
“Chris kept telling me, ‘I’m not dumbing this down just because you’ve never tapped. We’re going to make this on a level that is legit, and all tappers around the world will be like, ‘Okay, that was sincere, that wasn’t a joke,’ ” Tatum shares.
The star also revealed that his anxiety over the dance sequence led him to practice almost religiously for months in advance.
Hail, Caesar! – which also stars George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson and Josh Brolin – hits theaters Feb. 5.

Tatum wasn’t overly worried about the vocals, because he did have a little singing experience — “I’ve sung to my daughter, and she cried every time” — and besides, “if I’d sucked, they could have dubbed someone else’s voice in,” he says. It’s Tatum on the soundtrack, though, to which he credits “the magical tools they have” in recording studios nowadays.
Vulture’s weekly newsletter of the best TV and movie recommendations.
How did the Coens pitch this part to you? It’s a good thing you said yes, because there probably aren’t many other actors that could have pulled it off. I can’t exactly remember what the email was. Joel and Ethan — we have the same agent — were like, “Look, here’s a part, which we hope you want, because no one else can do it.” Knowing what it turned into, it’s hard to believe that was the truth. I know there are a lot of other people that could have crushed this thing. Because one, I don’t sing, and two, I don’t tap-dance. So all of that was completely new to me.
But I’ve been beating on the Coens’ door for years, man. One of the turning points in my whole career was my audition for No Country for Old Men. They wanted to see everybody — no-names, which I was, and name-names. I was almost 15 years too young for the part [that eventually went to Josh Brolin], but I just wanted to get in the room with them. I know I’m too young. Just get me in the room — I know that when I leave, I’ll be a better actor. It was when I realized that I should just try to be around very talented and smart people, and not worry about what the job is, even though I was never going to get it. And then cut to this. It was just so crazy for me to finally be on set with them.
Your dance number is really something. It just keeps going on and on…  In the script, it was like five sentences long — a dance number on a battleship, just a knee-slide, and then cut. And that became a six-minute song with tap-dancing. Chris Gattelli was my tap teacher and choreographer, and without him I never, ever, ever would’ve been able to do this, not in a million years. He believed in me until the day I was about to crack. I didn’t think tap-dancing was going to be easy, but I also had no idea how hard it was actually going to be. I just figured that if I did the moves, the sound would come out. But you actually have to be musical. You’re drumming with your feet, and you’re a part of the actual song. I’m used to dancing on the beat, or riding the beat, and with this you are the beat. If you miss a step, everyone can hear it — or not hear it. It’s nerve-racking. But everybody took care of me to a degree that is not even explainable, so I’m super lucky.
How long did you prepare, and what did it involve? I spent about three months preparing. It’s the most I’ve ever prepped for a six-minute section in a movie. We went over Christmas and New Year’s [in 2014], so I had all that time to let it gestate. I let it sink into my bones over the holiday break. When I’m nervous about something, I drill it to a point that is probably unhealthy, but as long as it works even halfway, I’m happy at the end of the tortuous day.
Did you have any background in singing? This was the first time I’ve ever sung in front of anyone. I’ve sung to my daughter, and she cried every time. No, I’ve never been a singer. When I was younger, just a dumb kid, and Usher came out, I was like, “Oh, man, I want to be the white Usher.” Then I was like, “Oh, right, I can’t sing.” I’m nowhere near as talented as Usher is, so that was quickly erased in my mind. But Ethan and Joel told me, “We don’t need you to riff.” And you know, Gene Kelly wasn’t like some fantabulous singer — he could sing efficiently.
I actually haven’t heard the finished version of the song, but I’m hoping and praying that with all, like, the magical tools that they have [in the recording studio] it’s going to sound decent. I probably didn’t work as much as I should have on the singing, because if I’d sucked, they could have dubbed someone else’s voice in, and I would not have felt bad about it. So I put all my efforts into the tapping.
How does this compare to the dancing in Magic Mike? They’re not even in the same realm. The fact that we had fun doing both is the only way they compare. With Magic Mike, we just tailored the dancing to everyone’s skills and strengths. You just did that all right, that’s a good look on you, let’s do that. This was a completely different thing, something that was done specifically at a certain time and in a certain style, and then kind of taking it one degree off and making it a Coen brothers film.
Now that you’ve done this, would you try something similar on Broadway? I don’t think I would ever consider trying Broadway. It would be a monumentous undertaking for me, and I just don’t know if my skill set is for live performing. Some people have been training to do that their entire lives. But I definitely am going to try something in the musical space in film, for sure. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and I have been friends since I got to town 13 years ago, and we’re going to eventually land on something together, because we’ve talked about it too long for it not to happen. He’s one of the most creative people I know, and I don’t think there’s anybody besides him I would think about doing it with. We’ll eventually land on something. Yeah, I want to.

0.25,"At long last, Don Cheadle's War Machine is getting a movie of his own.
Editor's note: The below contains full spoilers for Secret Invasion.Lt. Col. James “Rhodey” Rhodes first made his cinematic debut in 2008’s Iron Man, which means that the character has been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since its very inception. At that time, the role was played by Terrence Howard, but he would soon be replaced by Don Cheadle in 2010’s Iron Man 2. In this film, audiences finally got to see Tony Stark’s best friend – with some unfortunate help from Stark’s biggest industry rival, Justin Hammer – first don the War Machine armor.
Since that time, Don Cheadle has owned the role and made Lt. Col. Rhodes his own character, appearing in six other movies (seven if we're counting the post-credits scene for Captain Marvel), including Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, as well as having a brief appearance in the Disney+ series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and he'll be appearing in the forthcoming Disney+ series Secret Invasion. However, he's yet to appear in a film all his own. That is all changing with Armor Wars, where he’ll finally be stepping out of Tony Stark’s shadow to become a hero in his own right.
Editor's Note: This article was updated on July 30.
Thus far, there is no trailer for Armor Wars, as filming has not yet started.
With the script still being locked down, there is no set date for when filming will begin. Before audiences get a trailer, they’ll no doubt learn of some casting - both known characters and new ones.
That said, with the release slate as it currently stands, some assumptions can be made. If Armor Wars happens before Captain America: New World Order, which is slated for some time in 2024, then it’s likely production will have to start sometime this year, which means we’d most likely see a trailer early in 2024. However, if Armor Wars follows that, then it might be until later in 2024 that a trailer is released.
Until we get a nailed-down slate from Marvel, it’s all speculation.
...When you’re talking about a show that wants to be about seeing all the cool armors and, you know, Don Cheadle interacting with all these armors and sort of the legacy of Tony Stark, that became kind of cost prohibitive to do as a show. And we realized as a feature, not only can we get into some of the beautiful imagery that is from publishing, and there’s certainly an Armor Wars run, but also there’s ways then to leverage the ideas of that movie and affect other movies down the line.
Though Armor Wars currently has no release date, it was revealed at the 2022 D23 that it would be taking place after the events of Secret Invasion and will tie directly into that. Secret Invasion shows that Rhodey was replaced by an undercover Skrull for years, only for the real Rhodey to return finally. This a significant development, and Armor Wars will likely focus on War Machine's return to normal society.
The death of Tony Stark, I’m pretty sure, will play a role in the series. Where we’ve been sort of progressing Rhodey—even in the last film where he’s now up again and he’s now walking again and he’s now mobile again—so as the technology continues to develop and we keep making innovations in the suit and what happens, I imagine there’s gonna be another elevation and another way that we’re going to keep digging into that part of Rhodey.
It should be noted that the above quote came when Armor Wars was still being developed as a Disney+ series, so it’s possible that some of this information has changed. However, given that the need for a bigger budget necessitated the change, it seems reasonable that the character arc for Rhodey wouldn’t require changing.
The lore of Armor Wars, as covered above, sees Tony Stark grappling with his greatest nightmare – the theft of his technology, and its subsequent possession by very dangerous hands. With Stark most assuredly deceased in the MCU, it will fall to Rhodey to honor the memory and legacy of his best friend to do all he can to both recover the technology and ensure that no one ever uses it for nefarious or destructive ends. The narrative corollary to this is that the mission would require War Machine to step out of Iron Man’s long shadow to become a hero in his own right.
Written by David Micheline, drawn by Mark Bright and Barry Windsor-Smith, and running between Iron Man #225-#232, the ""Armor Wars"" storyline saw Stark technology stolen by a villain named Spymaster, who in turn was hired by Justin Hammer. Hammer then sold it to supervillains the world over, whose reckless use of it was responsible for much death and destruction. This is a worst-case scenario for Stark, who originally stopped being an arms dealer due to the collateral destruction his munitions were causing and the innocent lives that were taken.
Feeling heavy responsibility for failing to be more proactive in protecting his work, Stark and Rhodes set out to neutralize the tech of each villain. Not knowing who they could trust, they kept their plan entirely to themselves, which resulted in Iron Man appearing to be a rampaging vigilante, getting him kicked out of the Avengers, putting a target on his back from the US government, and estranging his friend, Captain America. Stark saw this sacrifice of his public image as necessary collateral damage as it resulted in him dismantling the underground network of armored villains who were terrorizing the world.
The series saw Stark crossing paths with heroes such as Nick Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D., Captain America, and the Avengers, as well as villains such as the Titanium Man, Beetle, Crimson Dynamo, Stingray, and Stilt-Man.
It should be noted that the concept of villains stealing Stark’s technology is, at this point, well-trod territory for the red and gold of ol’ shell head, going back as far as the first Iron Man and the very inception of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There, Obadiah Stane stole Stark’s arc reactor territory to create his behemoth, the War Monger. In Iron Man 2, aspects of his technology were leaked to Justin Hammer by Ivan Vanko, the son of Anton Vanko, an old associate of Howard Stark, before Hammer got his hands on the Iron Man armor for himself. Similar themes of stolen technology are found in Iron Man 3, though the technology at the center of the film - Extremis - is not necessarily Stark property. In fact, even in Spider-Man: Far from Home, the villainous Mysterio’s plan is to con Peter Parker into giving him control of Tony Stark’s proprietary defense system.
In each of those films, Stark’s concern was never about reclaiming his stolen technology as much as it was about stopping the villain from their dangerous agendas. Presumably, what will set Armor Wars apart from these previous films, is the mission of recovering stolen Stark technology that is being used for destructive ends.
This early on in the pre-production process, only one name has been released for behind-the-camera talent, that of comedian/writer Yassir Lester. Though he has no previous cinematic credits, he has written on Adult Swim’s Black Dynamite and Mr. Pickles animated series and has worked as both a writer and actor with Cheadle on Showtime's Black Monday.
""In the trailer, you see that he’s got to confront Nick [Fury.] He and Fury are gonna go at it throughout this show, as far as what they need to do, given what’s happened on this planet at this point. It’s kind of a thriller and a different kind of show than you usually see in the MCU, which is great that we can continue to keep changing it up and switching it up. It’s lots of fun.""
Though no other casting for Armor Wars has been released, given the story from the comics, the properties coming before it, and the characters that already exist in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it seems safe to assume audiences could see heroes such as Ironheart, Nick Fury, or Sam “the New Captain America” Wilson.
As for possible villains, if Armor Wars is closely tied to the events of Secret Invasion, it seems possible that there could be some Skrull villains introduced in that series that could carry over into War Machine’s conflict. Just as likely, given Rhodes’ military and government ties, the villains could be born of those organizations or something akin to them, something like Hydra or A.I.M.

""What are you gonna do? Shoot us all?""","Marvel’s “Armor Wars,” originally planned as a TV series for Disney+, is being redeveloped as a feature film, Variety has learned.
“Armor Wars” will star Don Cheadle, reprising his MCU role of James “Rhodey” Rhodes, a.k.a. War Machine. The project is based on Marvel Comics’ seven-issue arc of the same name within the story of Iron Man, and follows Rhodes as he must face what happens when Tony Stark’s tech falls into the wrong hands.
Yassir Lester, who was originally set as the series’ head writer, remains attached to write the project.
This is Marvel’s second big shake-up of the week. “Blade” director Bassam Tariq stepped away from the project on Tuesday, just two months before the film was set to begin production, signaling a potential delay from the originally set Nov. 2023 premiere date. However, “Armor Wars” won’t slide into that date — it’s unclear when the new movie will arrive in theaters.
At the D23 Expo in Anaheim earlier this month, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige stated that “Armor Wars” would follow the events of “Secret Invasion,” the MCU TV series set to debut in early 2023 on Disney+, in which Cheadle’s Rhodes will also appear. On the red carpet with Variety’s Marc Malkin, the actor explained how the two projects are tied together.
Cheadle also confirmed that he’s finished with his initial contractual obligations to Marvel Studios, but noted that he’s open to additional MCU projects. “Now it’s just, if something sounds fun and I’m presented with it, it’s like ‘Yeah, let’s go.'” To note, the actor’s last appearance as Rhodes — a guest spot on 2021’s “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” —  earned Cheadle a Primetime Emmy nomination.
Speculatively, based on the comic books, villains that could potentially appear in “Armor Wars” include Stilt-Man, the Crimson Dynamo and Justin Hammer, who was played by Sam Rockwell in “Iron Man 2.” The “Armor Wars” comics were written by David Michelinie and Bob Layton in 1987 and 1988 with art by Mark D. Bright and Barry Windsor-Smith.

0.75,"Things took a dark turn in ""Wentworth Prison,"" even for Outlander. The shadow of Black Jack Randall has loomed over this entire season, and just when we thought he couldn't get any worse (or hurt Jamie and Claire anymore than he has already), we got ""Wentworth Prison."" It was essentially an hour of gruesome torture on every conceivable level, the likes of which not even Game of Thrones can truly boast (not yet, anyway).
The hour started off with dark portends, as Taran McQuarrie was brought back briefly only to be hung in a gruesome lineup of enemies of the crown. His mood was staid, telling Jamie he knew ultimately this is how he would die, which is one reason he never left anyone behind. But Jamie, ever defiant, attempts to fight and evade his captors. Even though he was unlikely to win, he hoped he might be killed quickly before the noose. The only thing worse than being hung, though, is to be ""saved"" by Captain Jack Randall.
The rest of ""Wentworth Prison"" focused on Claire's brave and clever -- but foiled -- plans to rescue Jamie, and Jamie's dealings with Black Jack in the dungeon. All of Black Jack's former torture of the two was brought back up in these exchanges, from the references to Jamie's scars to Jack considering letting his ""dog"" Marley rape Claire. Ultimately, though, his desire is for Jamie, and it's a game he plays without being rushed. He coddles Jamie and then beats him, he shoves Jamie's hand again his penis, and then walks away. He ""tests"" Jamie's sincerity about letting Black Jack rape him by nailing his broken hand to a table while Claire holds him and cries. And as he said, he's only getting started.
Tobias Menzies is completely terrifying as Jack. His character is a man whose secret sexuality has been so deeply repressed within him that he has allowed it to turn into a twisted and dark thing. He lashes out with terrifyingly controlled rage, and yet, also acts as if all of this is part of an elaborate plan. Perhaps it is. He tells Jamie that any man can be broken, and proceeds to prove it. Jamie attacks him, and Marley nearly kills him in return, but then Jack kicks Marley in the face to get him off of Jamie so he doesn't kill him. It's not just torture, but manipulation as well.
When Claire enters the scene in her attempt to save Jamie, Jack was basically given a gift. By threatening to harm Claire, he knew Jamie would acquiesce to him, and offer up himself instead. Jamie does just that, despite Claire's protestations, and Jack does keep his word by letting her go. But Black Jack doesn't return to Jamie to assault him quickly -- he draws it out by licking his scars and slowly undressing him. This is a fantasy he has obviously wanted for so long he's not going to rush a single thing. It makes the entire scene all the more horrifying and traumatic, and Jamie's countenance at the end of the episode is that of a man preparing to be completely broken by this act, which is worse than he could have imagined.
""Wentworth Prison"" is a fascinating subversion in that it is Claire who must find a group willing to form a rescue party, and who must scheme and even fight, with great physicality, to rescue her loved one. Claire is the one who is mounting the offensive, while it is Jamie who is being tortured and sexually assaulted. That, of course, is exactly how this back half of the season started: with Claire bent over a table, breasts bared, as Jack was about to rape her before Jamie came to her rescue.
In Outlander, Black Jack Randall is the epitome and sum of all evil, but the only power Claire holds over him is her knowledge of the future, bestowing a ""curse"" upon him with the exactly date of his death. Hopefully it's soon, not just for Claire and Jamie's sake, but for ours. ""Wentworth Prison"" was an excruciating episode that is leading up to what looks to be a difficult finale. Though I trust in Murtagh's cattle plans to save Jamie, what may happen to him before that may be extremely hard to bear.
Episode Rating: T for torture, H for horror. I can't pair stars with an episode like this.
-- I did like Jack referencing Brutus, since Tobias Menzies played him on the HBO series Rome.
-- ""Nothing like a wife to make a man feel disquieted at his own death"" - McQuarrie.
-- That hammer made me nervous throughout the entire episode, and it's no wonder! It was really used for terrible things.
-- Claire had several powerful moments in this episode, from her vomiting after talking to Sir Fletcher, to her holding on to Jamie while Jack assaulted him.
--  Claire: ""You beast."" Jack: ""You can do better than that."" Claire: ""You fucking sadistic piece of shit!""

The end is nigh, Outlander fans. Tonight's ""Wentworth Prison"" and last week's ""The Search"" have set the stage for a brutal end to season 1. (You'll want to note that the finale airs May 30—not next week.) So without further ado, let's revisit the bloody events of this penultimate episode.
We open on gallows—a veritable conveyor belt of hangings. One after another after another. Jamie and McQuarrie, in chains, wait their turn. Jamie tries to hatch an escape plan, but McQuarrie isn't game.
""Is it the rope you're afraid?"" he asks Jamie.
""No,"" Jamie replies. ""What grieves me is to think my wife will never forgive me for foolishly getting myself hung.
""Aye, nothing like a wife to make a man feel disquieted in his own death,"" McQuarrie answers, before his own name is called and he mounts the gallows. He goes down declaring fealty to Scotland, but he's not out. The force didn't break his neck, so he's left squirming on the rope as Jamie is summoned. The Laird puts up a fight, but there's not much a man in shackles can do. The noose is placed around his neck when a voice calls out to stop the execution. It's Black Jack. But he's no savior: He throws him in a dungeon cell, fate uncertain.
Meanwhile, Claire is enacting a plan of her own. She pays a visit to prison warden Sir Fletcher, asking if she may visit Jamie (whom she shrewdly explains is a distant relation). Paying her respects her duty as a good Christian woman, after all. He denies her request (it'd just be too dangerous), but does return with a box of his personal effects.
Claire and Murtagh, who accompanied her, take their leave and go to a nearby drinking establishment, where Angus and Rupert are merrily rolling the dice with the locals. Their seeming insensitivity to Jamie's plight is actually a ruse for deep intel gathering. As it turns out, their competitors are jailers at the prison and they're chatty drunks. Angus and Rupert learn that the warden insists on having his evening meal in private followed by a 25-minute Bible-reading session and quiet reflection. Which means that he's away from his office (and important things like, say, keys) for about an hour. Just enough time to break out Jamie?
Back at Wentworth, Black Jack finally makes an appearance in Jamie's cell. And he's not alone—he's brought his heavy, a very large man named Marley. In his hands, Randall holds Jamie's petition. It turns out the Wentworth bar flies aren't the only ones with loose ale lips. (Yes, we're looking at about you, Sandringham!) Randall sets the parchment on fire, effectively dashing any hopes Jamie has of becoming a truly free man.
Claire returns to the prison at the hour of Sir Fletcher's respite, insisting that she had a letter to pick up from the warden. The guard—confused—seats Claire and Murtagh in Fletcher's office to wait, while he goes about his duties. Claire and Murtagh hurriedly search the office for anything (a map) that will help them locate Jamie. But they're soon interrupted by the jailer, whom Murtagh swiftly dispatches with a swift hit to the face. With him out of the way, Claire has less than an hour to not only find Jamie in the serpentine structure, but to also get him out. She peers into cells yelling his name (maybe use your inside voice, Claire?), until one of the prisoners tells her to look downstairs. ""That's where they keep those of us that hanging is too good for,"" the old man says ominously.
With no knowledge of the rescue attempt in progress, Black Jack begins his slow, sadistic mindf—ery of Jamie. He tells Jamie he can't be saved—that this is just a momentary reprieve. He asks Jamie if he ever thinks about him. Then he gets to his aim: If only Jamie will admit that he's afraid, Randall will give him a final gift: ""a clean honorable death of his own choosing."" In short: Black Jack requires Jamie's full surrender. And he'll get it. What? But did it strike anyone else as odd that Black Jack never specifies what the alternative is? I mean, given his experience with Black Jack, he can probably figure it out. And I guess deductive reasoning would lead you to believe it's a dishonorable death not of his own choosing, but I, personally, would like to know exactly what I'm signing up for before I agree to make a deal with a known psycho.
Jamie decides that surrendering is not an options—which pleases Randall.
""I have to admit there would be a part of me that would be crestfallen if you did,"" Black Jack says. ""You know that every man can be broken. It's truly nothing to be ashamed of.""
And at that, he asks to see Jamie's scarred back (i.e. his handiwork). As Randall comes near, Jamie attacks him, but to little avail as Goon Marley throws him against a wall and chokes him, nearly to death until Black Jack intercedes. Because he wants him for himself. Randall begins meting out Jamie's punishment. He has him put his hand on a table and violently strikes it several times with a hammer. Claire can hear Jamie cry out from nearby.
""Why do you force me to treat you in such an abominable way?"" Black Jack asks Jamie. As Jamie collapses into his arms, Randall takes the captive's hand to his bulge.
""I'll kill you,"" Jamie says.
""I could take you right now,"" Randall says, but then thinks better of it. ""No, I will not give into coarse passion.""
Waiting for Randall to leave Jamie's cell, Claire finds her way to the prison's backdoor and leaves it unlocked for later. Claire finally finds Jamie alone in his cell. She works to break his chains.
""You truly have a gift for showing up at the most unexpected times,"" Randall, returned, says from behind her.
Following a bit of a verbal tussle, words turn into actions as Claire takes on both Randall and Marley (truly impressive). Jamie stabs Marley with some sort of stick, leaving Claire to contend with Randall. But he overtakes her and chokes her. Jamie yells for him to stop.
""Make me a better offer,"" Black Jack says.
""Have me,"" Jamie says, offering himself as sacrifice for Claire. But Randall wants a small test to prove Jamie's intent. Randall once again has Jamie place his hand—the same ruined hand—on the table. But this time, he grabs a nail and drives it through Jamie's hand! Then he asks for a kiss! Sick, sick puppy. Claire is still in the cell, wailing and watching everything happen.
""Take her away,"" Jamie says.",Collider,Ew,,,
0.5555555555555555,"In 2012, there was an idea: to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if they could become something more. The culmination of that idea resulted in The Avengers (2012), a cinematic crossover event the likes of which the world had never seen before. Built on a multitude of well-received films including Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), the first of what would become many Avengers films officially made the Marvel Cinematic Universe a wildly successful experiment, racking in over 1.5 billion dollars at the global box office. That film set off the real beginnings of the grand MCU story, now referred to as the Infinity Saga, which received a dynamite conclusion with Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). Now, several years later, one question remains: where does the MCU go next? We knew that it would be quite some time before we saw all of Marvel's heroes unite again, but that's set to change in a few years. Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (2025) was confirmed at San Diego Comic-Con 2022 to be the fifth installment of the Avengers franchise, and will once again be the first half of a two-part story.
As the title implies, this film will cement the dreaded Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) as Marvel's next big bad, bringing with him all sorts of chaos and madness to the conclusion of the Multiverse Saga. Even though The Kang Dynasty is the conclusion of Phase 6 and we've only just started with Phase 5, we're slowly but surely getting more and more details about what's in store for Marvel's next major event. To learn more about the film's cast, crew, release date, and more, here is everything we know about Avengers: The Kang Dynasty.
Editor's Note: This article was updated on November 28.
Don't expect to see any footage from Avengers: The Kang Dynasty any time soon. Filming hasn't even begun for the hotly anticipated project yet so the only piece of promotional material is the logo for the film that we got to see following its announcement at SDCC 2022, complete with blue coloring in honor of its titular bad guy.
The age of a multiverse conquering tyrant will officially begin when Avengers: The Kang Dynasty arrives on May 1, 2026. The movie was previously scheduled to come out on May 2, 2025. Given the sheer amount of money that the last four Avengers films made at the box office, Avengers: The Kang Dynasty will almost certainly be a theatrical release. As for streaming, if the pattern for MCU theater to streaming schedules persists, we can also almost certainly expect to see Avengers: The Kang Dynasty exclusively arrive on the new streaming service being formed by merging Disney+ and Hulu roughly a month and a half after its theatrical premiere.
Like Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: The Kang Dynasty gets its namesake from a landmark Marvel Comics event series, and it's easy to presume that the film adaptation will take some inspiration from the comics. Before we give a brief recap, keep in mind that the following plot details could end up making their way into the film and be considered spoilers. If you want to go into Avengers: The Kang Dynasty completely blind, you may want to skip this section.
First things first, who exactly is Kang the Conqueror? Although the Kang Dynasty comic began in 2001, Kang has been causing trouble in the mainline Marvel Comics universe ever since the 1960s. Kang comes from an entirely different universe and time period from the mainline Marvel universe, Earth 616. Hailing from the thirtieth century, he also has a shocking connection to one of Marvel's most famous heroes. That's because Kang's real name is Nathaniel Richards, and he's the descendant of none other than Reed Richards, AKA Mister Fantastic, AKA the smartest man alive, and AKA the leader of the Fantastic Four. Like Thanos, Kang sees himself not as a villain, but as a savior. His brilliant intellect led to him becoming dissatisfied with the peaceful life of his time, stealing the time-travel technology created by another ancestor of his (Doctor Victor von Doom), and after seeing various timelines and dimensions that end in pain and suffering, he became mad with the thought that the only way the multiverse can be saved is if he has complete and total dominion over it.
Since his debut in the 1960s, Kang and many alternate versions of Kang have tangled with Marvel's heroes, but he easily got closest to succeeding in his conquest of Earth-616 during The Kang Dynasty. The Conqueror, along with his son Scarlet Centurion, the most advanced army he's ever assembled, and even some supervillains who declared loyalty to him, declared war on Earth and all its citizens. The Avengers valiantly fought against him, but Kang slowly but surely gained control of the dimension, even incinerating Washington D.C. completely and massacring millions. For a brief time, the heroes had no choice but to surrender, meaning Kang had finally won. As you might expect, The Avengers were able to regroup and capture Kang before he could do more harm, but this still doesn't change the fact that the blue tyrant had left his mark on the world in a horrific fashion, making him one of Earth's deadliest enemies.
Technically, we got our first introduction of Kang in the conclusion of the appropriately time-melting Loki (2021-), though the one who calls himself He Who Remains (Jonathan Majors) is an alternate version of the Conqueror. He Who Remains was the man responsible for the creation of the so-called ""Sacred Timeline"" as well as the Time Variance Authority who keeps it in check, creating for himself a timeline where everything happened a specific way. When he's confronted by Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino), He Who Remains tells them that prior to the Sacred Timeline's creation, various variants of himself battled for control of the multiverse, resulting in countless casualties and the destruction of entire dimensions. He Who Remains came out as the victor, but still being fundamentally human, he's grown bored with running the multiverse and allows Sylvie to kill him, knowing full well that this will unleash Kang and his other variants on the multiverse.
In February 2023, we finally got a proper introduction to Kang the Conqueror when he officially arrived in the MCU multiverse as the main villain of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023). In the movie, we learn that Kang (or rather, this version of Kang) has been imprisoned in the Quantum Realm for a long time. That particular variant of the Conqueror is left trapped in the Quantum Realm, but the film's end-credits scene reveals that the people who exiled the villain there in the first place were a council of variant Kangs, revealing that there are infinitely more Kangs in the Multiverse to deal with. Another variant of Kang appears in the recently released Loki Season 2, but to avoid spoilers, we won't be discussing that part of the story here. You can read about it in this article though.
There have been a lot of changes behind the scenes for this production. The latest update is that Loki head writer Michael Waldron has been confirmed to be writing the screenplay for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. As always, Marvel Studios Head Kevin Feige will be executive producing the film.
At the moment, Avengers: The Kang Dynasty is between directors. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' Destin Daniel Cretton, who was previously attached to direct, left the film in order to focus on other projects. Shang-Chi has been consistently praised as one of the best films of Marvel's Phase 4 due to its strong character moments and impeccable action set pieces, so Cretton's involvement was a highlight for many fans. The director is still set to helm Shang-Chi 2, which is expected to be released prior to The Kang Dynasty in Phase 6, and the Wonder Man series starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania writer Jeff Loveness was previously announced to be penning the script, but there are reports that Loveness may have left the project as well.
The main cast for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty has yet to be revealed. Originally, it seemed like Jonathan Majors would undoubtedly be in the film as Kang the Conqueror. However, following the actor being charged with domestic violence and assault, this has become somewhat doubtful. As for the film's roster of Avengers that will appear, we can only assume that it will be massive. There are still quite a few films and shows to air prior to The Kang Dynasty so there's no way to tell who for certain will appear, but we can list off quite a few guesses as to who may show up to fight Kang.
These heroic protagonists who could show up include *inhale* Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), White Vision (Paul Bettany), Photon (Teyonah Parris), Captain America (Anthony Mackie), Loki, The Watcher (Jeffery Wright), Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), the Eternals (Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, and Barry Keoghan), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), Moon Knight (Oscar Isaac), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Werewolf by Night (Gael García Bernal), She-Hulk (Tatiana Maslany), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Panther (Letitia Wright), Ant-Man, the Wasp, Stature (Kathryn Newton), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, and Sean Gunn), Echo (Alaqua Cox), Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), Ironheart (Dominique Thorne), Agatha Harkness (Kathryn Hahn), Daredevil (Charlier Cox), the Thunderbolts (Florence Pugh, Olga Kurylenko, Hannah John-Kamen, David Harbour, and Wyatt Russell), Blade (Mahershala Ali), Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and the Fantastic Four *exhale*. You know... just to name a few.
Oh yes, as Avengers: The Kang Dynasty is only part one of a two-part story. The second part is Avengers: Secret Wars (2026), based on the iconic comic series of the same name. Now, technically there are two different comic events called Secret Wars, but the upcoming film is expected to be an adaptation of the 2015 story, one so massive and ambitious that even hardcore fans consider it unadaptable. Despite this, Marvel will still try to accomplish the impossible by bringing Secret Wars to the big screen one year after The Kang Dynasty on May 7, 2027.

The House of Mouse will bring 'The Eras Tour' movie to streaming this spring.","Marvel's Avengers: The Kang Dynasty is still in early development, but we already have a few details about what's in store including the cast and creative team.
The film was first announced during San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022 when Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige unveiled plans for Phase Five and Phase Six of the MCU, which have been dubbed the Multiverse Saga.
Following the introduction of He Who Remains on Disney+'s Loki, the upcoming Avengers project will revolve around an alternate-timeline variant of the character Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors.
The character makes his MCU debut in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, which will be released on Feb. 17.
From the cast to the release date, here's everything to know about Avengers: The Kang Dynasty.
While Marvel hasn't revealed the official plot for the film, it will likely take inspiration from the comic of the same name, which features Kang the Conqueror and his son Marcus taking over the planet.
So far, the only cast member confirmed for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty is Majors, who will be playing the titular character. However, because the film is touted as an Avengers team-up, there will likely be appearances from Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange), Anthony Mackie (Captain America), Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) and Mark Ruffalo (Hulk), among others.
Speaking with EW, Feige discussed how Marvel decided on making Kang the next big bad in the MCU.
""For years, we've always had the inkling that Kang would be an amazing follow-up to Thanos,"" he said. ""He's got that equal stature in the comics, but he's a completely different villain. Mainly, that's because he's multiple villains. He's so unique from Thanos, which we really liked.""
Shortly after Avengers: The Kang Dynasty was teased at San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel confirmed to Deadline that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton had been tapped to helm the film.
During a conversation with Variety in October 2022, Majors confirmed that he has already started talking with Cretton about the script and his direction for the story.
""We're dealing with myths: what is a 'Kang'? What is a movie? You know, what is an MCU movie? What does that mean? What's that look like?"" Majors explained. ""Those are the questions we are asking, but all of that works when it's grounded and really, really really, tucked into the given circumstances of what's going on between these people and what we can illuminate for ourselves as a species.""
Jeff Loveness is slated to write the upcoming Avengers film. He also wrote the script for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania which is set to be released in February 2023.
In June 2023, Variety reported that the Avengers: The Kang Dynasty release date has been pushed back a year to May 1, 2026. It will be followed by Avengers: Secret Wars on May 7, 2027. The two films will serve as the conclusion to Phase Six of the MCU, as stated during San Diego Comic-Con.

0.35,"The Ducks have taken the ice for the last time.
Disney+ called game on The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers. After two seasons of following the 12-year-old Evan following his hockey dreams after being cut from the now-powerhouse Mighty Ducks, the streamer won't be moving forward with another season of the sequel series. It's one of two shows to be axed by Disney+ on Friday along with the John Stamos-led Big Shot.
Following Season 2, the hockey series seemed almost certainly doomed as TVLine notes. Along with Big Shot, Game Changers was approved for a second season despite an underwhelming performance relative to what it cost to make. The move is likely what led to the firing of longtime Disney executive Peter Rice who reportedly drew the ire of the company for his questionable decision-making.
Game Changers did score points, however, for carrying the torch of the classic films. The first season featured the return of Emilio Estevez as Gordon Bombay and saw Evan (Brady Noon) and his mother Alex (Lauren Graham) create a new team of underdogs to challenge an exclusive Mighty Ducks team that had lost its way. The mix of heart and humor was enough to earn a Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an 87% score from critics.
After Evan and company won back the Mighty Ducks name, however, Season 2 immediately took a hit with the shocking exit of Estevez. The series aimed to fill the void by bringing in Josh Duhamel to play Coach Cole, a no-nonsense former hockey player teaching at the prestigious hockey academy Evan and his friends were heading to in an effort to up their game. He'd ultimately fit right in, even getting the chance to direct an episode of the series. With Duhamel's addition, Season 2 also introduced Jace (Naveen Paddock), Coach Cole's son who fought through ""the glitch"" in order to come through in big moments on the ice. The season ended on a high note as Coach Cole and Alex's teams came together to defeat Team Canada led by Coach T (Dylan Playfair). Alex and Jace both had scouts from major universities eyeing them and Jace patched his relationship with his dad.
Game Changers also featured a cast of Maxwell Simkins, Swayam Bhatia, Julee Cerda, Luke Islam, Bella Higginbotham, Taegen Burns, Kiefer O’Reilly, and De’Jon Watts among others. The series was also no stranger to the occasional appearance from other Mighty Ducks movie alums like the Bash Brothers played by Elden Henson and Aaron Lohr as well as Guy Germaine (Garrette Henson), Adam Banks (Vincent A. LaRusso), and Connie Moreau (Marguerite Moreau).
All episodes of The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers can be streamed on Disney+. Check out the trailer for Season 2 below.

It's time for The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers to get off the ice.
The Disney+ series spun off from the trilogy of '90s movies about a ragtag youth hockey team has been canceled after two seasons, EW has confirmed. It's not a great day for sports shows at the Mouse House, as the John Stamos-led basketball dramedy Big Shot has also been axed after two seasons.
Game Changers premiered in March 2021 and starred Lauren Graham as a new character, coach Alex Morrow, while Emilio Estevez reprised his role from the movies as Gordon Bombay. However, Estevez exited after season 1 in response to the show's COVID vaccination requirement, and Josh Duhamel stepped in as the new adult male lead. Season 2 premiered last September and concluded in November.
Big Shot debuted in April 2021, starring Stamos as Marvyn Korn, a disgraced college basketball coach who takes a job instructing a team at a private all-girls school. The cast also included Jessalyn Gilsig, Richard Robichaux, Sophia Mitri Schloss, Nell Verlaque, Tiana Le, and Monique Green. Season 2 released all 10 of its episodes last October.
Stamos told EW last year that he had to lobby for the sophomore season. ""Some executive said, 'Well, it's not a slam dunk for season 2,'"" he recalled. ""I said, 'Well, how do we make it a slam dunk?' There's not much like it on [Disney+], but I think that's why it should be on there.""

0.3636363636363636,"What did you do when you were a 1-year-old? Because North West sat front row at Givenchy's show during Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2015.
Her mommy's mini-me, North matched Kim Kardashian in an all-black, sheer ensemble. Kim opted for open-toe pumps, while the tiny style star rocked lace-up combat boots.
Solidifying her baby A-lister status, North nabbed a front-row seat atop Kim's lap between Beyoncé and Vogue's Anna Wintour during New York Fashion Week Fall 2015.
The mother-daughter duo stepped out to support Kanye West and his Adidas Originals x Kanye West Yeezy Season 1 fashion show.
Not only did North get to sit beside Nicki Minaj at Alexander Wang's fashion show, but the trendy tot stunned in a custom-made outfit created by the designer himself!
West went comfy when she attended her dad's Yeezy Season 2 fashion show during NYFW in 2015.
Sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with Wintour — among a star-studded crowd including Drake, Jaden Smith, Lorde and Michael Strahan — North sported a monochromatic, beige hoodie and leggings, not unlike Mom.
After a two-year hiatus, Kanye returned to the runway to present his Yeezy Season 8 collection — and while his clothing comeback was nonetheless exciting, a tiny surprise stole the show.
Following in her father's footsteps, North made her rap debut while the models walked during the show, and her dad beamed beside her.
Like father, like daughter in more ways than one! North pulled a piece out of her dad's fashion archive and added her own stylish flare when she attended the Dior Homme Spring/Summer 2023 show with Kim in Paris.
She donned Kanye's Pastelle varsity jacket, pairing it with black pants and Balenciaga's chunky steel-toe Hardcrocs. The 9-year-old accessorized the look with a tiny purse and bright blue Louis Vuitton 1.1 Millionaire sunglasses.
Having established a signature grunge style, North pulled out all the stops when she attended the Jean-Paul Gaultier Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2022-2023 fashion show during Paris Fashion Week.
North coordinated with her mom in rocking pinstripes accessorized with nose rings that dangled down into chained necklaces. They, along with grandma Kris Jenner, topped off their looks with blackout shades.
Just like Aunt Khloé on her right, North watched the runway through sunglasses while at Milan Fashion Week. Her front-row neighbors included siblings Chicago and Saint, and grandma Kris Jenner and her boyfriend Corey Gamble. The family coordinated in shades of white, black and shiny silver to watch Dolce & Gabbana's Spring/Summer 2023 Womenswear show.
At the end of the show, North watched her mom Kim strut down the catwalk with designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana to celebrate the collection.
Paris Fashion Week welcomed North in the fall of 2022 as she sported baggy dark denim to the Balenciaga Womenswear Spring/Summer 2023 show. The eldest of the Kardashian-West offspring stepped out with her siblings in similar grunge apparel, all accompanied by dad Kanye.

The 9-year-old is in Paris right now, and she was photographed Saturday heading into a hotel with a handler/escort of some sort as paps and onlookers flanked her on both sides.
She definitely made a statement ... rocking a full head-covering leather face mask with accompanying hair extensions running down her back. Footwear-wise ... bedazzled Crocs?
Our sources tell us NW was with her mama in this instance, although Kim is not seen in any of the photos here. Interestingly enough, Ye is also in Paris at the moment ... but it doesn't look like he was tagging along in this particular outing.
It's pretty on-brand for West-Kardashian household ... both Kim and Kanye have famously hid their entire heads under garments in the recent past -- especially Ye, who's done it time and again in the past few years.
In fact, Kanye has worn full face masks at least a couple times in Paris -- earlier this year when he went with Julia Fox for a winter Fashion Week, and last year as well for a Balenciaga event. Of course, he's worn a lot of them here in the States as well ... be it at concerts of his, or just hitting the town. He doesn't seem to like to show his mug much.
Kim has also been getting into full headgear lately -- but definitely not on Kanye's level. Still, she made a splash last year during the Met Gala ... first rocking a full-blown leather getup right before the event, and of course -- showing up looking like a shadow on the red carpet.

Kylie Jenner is honoring Virgil Abloh's legacy.
The Kardashians star, 24, shared the story behind her 2022 Met Gala look on Instagram Monday night, paying homage to the late fashion designer in the caption of a carousel of pictures of herself getting ready.
Tagging Abloh's Off-White brand, the makeup mogul began, ""Virgil and i were supposed to go to the Met together before it got postponed in 2020. to celebrate V tonight and his incredible legacy truly means the world to me.""

Jenner shared more details from behind the scenes in a follow-up post, including a closeup of the ""Off"" lettering on the illusion paneling of her fitted corset top to a choice of accessories and flowers seemingly sent by Shannon Abloh, the designer's widow.
""Kylie, you are going to be amazingly perfect tonight,"" a note in the colorful arrangement read. ""He will be with you guiding you up the stairs. We all know he never missed a party.""
Abloh died in November 2021 at age 41 following a two-year battle with cancer, PEOPLE confirmed at the time.

0.2619047619047619,"""The likelihood that I'll find myself on some version of a Challenge in the future is very high,"" the three-time champion tells EW.
Sydney Bucksbaum is a writer at Entertainment Weekly covering all things pop culture – but TV is her one true love. She currently lives in Los Angeles but grew up in Chicago so please don't make fun of her accent when it slips out.
It took almost a decade, but longtime The Challenge veteran Wes Bergmann finally got his third championship.
After winning The Challenge: Rivals II in 2013 with his partner CT Tamburello for his second title, The Real World: Austin alum returned to the franchise six more times to go for the three-peat. And while it took a whole new spin-off for Bergmann to finally add another win to his résumé, he proved that good things come to those who wait, because he absolutely dominated the game in every aspect all season long on The Challenge: All Stars 3. And in last week's finale, he came in first place in almost every single leg of the final and ultimately crossed the finish line as a three-time Challenge champion.
Below, Bergmann breaks down what led to him finally getting that third win, what it means for his future on The Challenge, and more.
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Congrats on getting your third win! It's been a while since you got your second win on Rivals II, so to what do you attribute finally getting that third title?
WES BERGMANN: I mean, I played a flawless game. Let's start with that. It is what it is. I'm normally pretty cocky, but let's be real, I played a very great game. In the times where I lose first, I just kind of get picked on more than the average person. I walk into every single game I play several steps behind, just because of what I've built and people thinking that if they get rid of me, they'll get that in return. On All Stars, I thought that that was going to be different, but quite frankly, it wasn't all that different. I came in with my guard down and then I found out real quickly that there was going to be a lot of people gunning for me for the same reasons as the flagship show. So I just dealt with it accordingly.
How has this win affected your outlook on your future on The Challenge moving forward?
It doesn't change my outlook at all. It's a game that I love and always have and probably always will. The likelihood that I'll find myself on some version of a Challenge in the future is very high. Having won, I'm aware that my target is always big, but a fresh win means that it's just going to be a fresher target. It's like they just repainted my target with fresh red paint. That might mean I have to adjust my style a little bit, but it also might mean I just lean into it because I'm playing with house money at this point.
Could we ever see you return to the flagship franchise or are you just focused on All Stars and spin-offs at this point?
I've been invited to every single thing The Challenge has ever done — every spin-off, every flagship, everything, and I probably always will. If you don't see me on something, it's a scheduling thing and it's not any deeper than that. I have a day job that I love and it's very fulfilling and it's something that I can do until I'm 80 years old, whereas The Challenge just isn't, so I have to take my version of a day job, my business, more seriously than I do The Challenge. Sometimes there's just things that I can't get out of in my real life due to scheduling. So the next thing I can do, whether that's CBS [spin-off The Challenge: USA], whether that's flagship, whether that's All Stars, or whether it's some other random brainchild concoction of TJ Lavin, if I've got time in my schedule, I'm going to do it. I'm not picking and choosing like, ""It'd be better for my brand if I moved over to CBS, so let me just hold out, not go on 'fill in the blank something' in hopes that I can do that."" I don't think like that. If there's a shot, I take it.
Like you said, you're always cocky when it comes to your abilities, but this season, from the start, it felt like you were on another level with saying you were there to win and no one could beat you. Did you really know from the beginning this was your season to lose or did you doubt yourself along the way?
I don't want to say that I doubted it. It's just that I very much was reminded early on that all the other players were very good. When I signed up for All Stars, I thought that more layups were going to be there, at least on the guy's side. But it just wasn't. It was one killer after another and it doesn't matter what game or what channel or whatever we're playing, if I'm looking around at Brad and Nehemiah and Jordan and Mark Long and Laterrian, the list goes on, but if I'm not taking those guys seriously, I don't deserve to win. Those are men that on any given day could beat me at anything. It's not that I doubted myself as much as I took my competition very seriously because they deserve it. They're good.
All Stars also really gave you an opportunity to show a new side of your Challenge persona, with not being censored and giving fans a deeper, unfiltered look into your strategizing and gameplay. Did you go into this season intending on using this new version of The Challenge to show yourself in a new light?
The only thing that's different about this is it lets me cuss. I'm already the funniest guy on The Challenge in the history of the show, so then you arm me with that extra gun of I'm allowed to cuss, and it's like, whoa! It blew the roof off. There's a reason why I dominated the confessional count this season: It's because the cussing is just so freeing. There's a reason why it's such an important tool of comedians. But on the showcasing your game thing, I've been doing that forever. I didn't do anything different there. I'm not ashamed of the fact that I show up, I play hard, and I narrate what I do in the interviews, and I make sure that there's cameras there for important moves that I make, because we're filming a freakin' documentary. If you're not there to help the producers document what you're doing, you're not doing your job. On that side, I didn't really change anything. But I'm telling you, back to that cussing, it's very, very helpful.
It's wild just how big of a difference that makes on All Stars.
Yeah, I was watching the CBS one last night and they had to bleep something out. I'm like, ""That sucks. I remember that."" And there's obviously a really good chance I'll be going back to that in some capacity, but it was nice having one season where I could pull that out of my arsenal.
How did this season and win compare to your past seasons and wins?
Each of the three wins that I've had means something different to me. To be the first sole [male] winner of The Challenge ever on the Brazil Duel was a big deal for the game in general and also my first win. That one still, a decade and a half later, feels surreal. Also helping CT get his first win [on Rivals II] that had eluded him for almost 10 years really meant a lot because he's an important figure in my life. To be able to help him do that, he kind of went on a win streak from there on out so I like to think that I was a small part [in that]. Obviously, he's incredibly talented, but I like to think I helped start that momentum that he really hasn't stopped running through people with.
And this one is a big deal because not only did I win, but I was instrumental in bringing my No. 1 and No. 2 friends in real life [with me]. We got first, second, and third place. People can sit around and be like, ""Wes is this, Wes is that,"" but I've once again not only [gone] to the final but brought my people with me. People should be clamoring to be one of my people. You can't win without loyalty. There is no such thing as a winner, especially a multi-time winner, that's disloyal. You cannot do it. It's impossible. I always find it funny when people throw the word ""snake"" and stuff out there because my success is based on doing the complete opposite. They see what they want to see, but that's why they don't win.
Obviously, nothing will ever come close to the War of the Worlds final, but how did this final compare to the others you've run in the past?
It was very challenging, but yeah, if you're throwing out the words War of the Worlds 1 final, they're two completely different things that you can't compare. One was a marathon and one was an ultra-marathon. But this one on All Stars was very challenging. It was probably top 15 most difficult finals ever across the 40-ish some odd seasons. It's not like it was easy by any stretch of the imagination. It just wasn't on the same level as the hardest one of all time.
Getting seasick when you had to sleep on the yacht during the overnight portion of the final is like worst case scenario — how did that affect you on day two?
I had to keep my head on a swivel. I was upset just because I had the rest of the guys dead to rights. I'd won every single leg essentially, just absolutely demolished it and I'm sitting there, and their eyes are rolling back into the back of their head and their feet were falling off and they're asking questions in a way that alludes to the fact that they're over it and they're ready to give me the trophy. Then all of a sudden, TJ gives everyone a little pit stop and I get seasick immediately. They all get hoards of food, they get a good night's rest, they hydrate, and I'm up all night throwing up so I got no food, I was just super tired. What I was really hoping for was that they were going to make us stand on a log for 10 hours because, quite frankly, if they did that, the likelihood was so high that there would have been one if not three drops on that night, and if it continued with running immediately after standing on a log, it would have been lights out. That's what I wanted.
Regardless of that night, you really did demolish the competition by coming in first in almost every single leg of the final and you never lost that lead on the second day. At what point did you realize you were going to win?
After the eating, I got into celebration mode. The other guys did very, very well, it's just I freakin' brought it. So it's less of comparing myself to them and more just like, ""Yo, I absolutely crushed it."" I was ready. I was focused. I didn't lose sight of the fact that every single checkpoint mattered, every single point mattered. I think it almost helped that Nehemiah got that five point lead because of his stars because it meant that from the first second, I had to take every point seriously. That just really focused me and I didn't get unfocused until I was sitting on top of that chest of money, at which point, it was over.
We have to talk about that eating challenge because that looked absolutely disgusting. How on earth did you go into ""zombie mode"" to smash that checkpoint?
Do you know how bad it would be to quit or to go super slow because you're mad at yourself and then still end up finishing it but lose because you were slow? You just have to get to a place where you're like, no matter what, I'm going to finish this. And if I don't do it and do it as fast as possible, then I am going to lose, I'm going to get made fun of, I'm going to feel horrible forever versus I just have to rip the Band-Aid off as best as possible because there is no way out of this. My back is up against the wall and the bully that's coming at me is this big pile of food. TJ was in the background because he loves the game and he wanted to make fun of us, but he was not there to host so you couldn't even in a joking manner negotiate with him. There was no one to negotiate with. Not that he would ever negotiate. But that was just a lot of food, and it was gross but also volume-based, it was a lot. Even if it's my favorite restaurant in the world, I'm going to have a hard time eating that quantity of food.
Yeah, I still can't believe how much you had to eat. How long did it take you?
It was traumatic. I have nightmares about it. I want to say like 45 minutes, maybe?
Wow. Was there any part of the final that we didn't see in the episodes that you wish had been shown?
No. Sometimes they edit out certain checkpoints if it was irrelevant, like if everyone did well and it just doesn't really add to the story. But they kind of had to show each one of these checkpoints because they were for points. If anything, I would have loved for them to have cut a checkpoint to show more in depth about some of them, like that star memory game, I did that in like four minutes and we had people that took 40. I was particularly proud of that one because that was a very, very difficult memory game that for some reason I just crushed.

Season three of the MTV franchise's nostalgic spinoff has finally premiered on Paramount+, once again assembling a stacked roster of returning fan favorites and blasts from reality TV past who haven't appeared on our screens in over a decade. And this time, the competition is fiercer than ever as every All Star duking it out for the grand prize has made it to a final during their Challenge career. Unlike in the NBA playoffs, however, there are no lay-ups among this cast.
Back for another shot at the title is All Stars season one champ Yes Duffy, along with season two's winning team of MJ Garrett and Jonna Mannion. Hoping to dethrone them are Challenge godfather Mark Long, who created the spinoff, Kendal Shepard, Tina Barton and Derrick Kosinski.
But season three will also see legends like Wes Bergmann, Jordan Wiseley and Veronica Portillo making their debut as All Stars, while Cynthia Roberts, the franchise's first-ever female winner, is returning for the first time since 1998. NBD!
Check out what the season three cast of The Challenge: All Stars is up to now...
One of the most notable figures from the OG franchise—with two wins in 14 seasons—The Real World: Austin vet is making his All Stars debut. When he's not masterminding blindsides and politicking in the Challenge house, the 38-year-old entrepreneur is the creator of the digital reality series The Blox and recaps Challenge episodes on his Patreon. Wes has been married to Amanda Hornick since 2018.
The Road Rules: South Pacific vet went on to become one of the franchise's most iconic female competitors, making it to two finals but never bringing home a win, and the 40-year-old is back on All Stars seeking redemption after refusing to compete in an elimination round last season. Host TJ Lavin was less than impressed.
In the 16 years since her memorable last appearance on the main show—The Duel, from which she was disqualified for punching Beth Stolarczyk—Tina's life is, in her words on the season two premiere, ""fabulous. I have a husband, no kids. I don't work. I have a pool in the backyard. Life is really good.""
One of the more recent alumni, Jemmye originated on 2010's The Real World: New Orleans, going on to compete on seven Challenges before making it to the final in the augural season of All Stars.
The 33-year-old lives in New Orleans and has her own swimwear collection, Just Jemm. She was part of the spinoff's first hookup, sharing a bed with Nehemiah Clark.
While The Real World: Go Big or Go Home alum has yet to net a win on the main show, she's hoping to take home the prize money during her rookie season as an All Star.
Kailah, 29, married Love Island UK alum Sam Bird in March 2022.
While the Road Rules: Northern Trail alum won both seasons of The Challenge she competed on, she has not appeared on TV since The Gauntlet II in 2004.
Roni, now 43, is married with two children and has worked at Hearst Magazines as a photo editor since 2006.
After going 0-for-2 in his All Stars career, including a trip to the finals in season two, Nehemiah is hoping to finally become a champ in season three. During The Real World: Austin vet's time on The Challenge, he won one of the four seasons he competed on before making his final appearance on 2011's Rivals.
But, even during his time away from the show, the 37-year-old still had ties to the franchise, remaining close friends with Wes Bergmann. The two created their own digital series, Friends With Benefits, during quarantine, which featured appearances from other alumni.
While he was once Beth Stolarcyzk's ""Tenderoni,"" Nehemiah struck up a showmance with Jemmye Carroll during All Stars' first season.
After making it to the finals in season two, The Real World: Austin alum is back for another shot at the All Stars crown. Previously, Melinda appeared on four seasons of The Challenge, competing alongside and then against her Texas housemate-turned-husband Danny Jamieson before their divorce in 2010.
The 39-year-old married Matt Collins in 2016 and the couple have a 3-year-old son, Camden. Melinda is the co-host of the Blonde Moments podcast.
Back for his second outing as an All Star, the two-time champion from The Real World: Key West is hoping for a better outcome this season.
In his decade away from the franchise, the 40-year-old became a teacher in North Dakota and is currently getting his doctorate.
The OG All Stars champ is back to defend his title after sitting out the second season. The 44-year-old Road Rules: Semester at Sea vet works as an architect and activist and is married with two sons.
""The immediate plan is I am going to take care of the people who helped get me here, from the child care to the family and friends who need support,"" Yes told E! News of his plans for the prize money after his big win. ""And then the second part is a bit more intentional. As an architect and as an activist, throughout my career I've worked for a number of non-profits, I've started non-profits that fight for social justice and design affordable housing. And I'm really thinking of this $500,000 as a grant to elevate the social impact of our work and address this housing affordability crisis because that's really where my blood has been for so long and that's where this money will go.""
After making her debut on The Real World: Skeletons, All Stars newcomer Sylvia competed on three seasons of The Challenge, making it to the finals of 2018's Final Reckoning.
The 33-year-old works as a real estate agent in Kansas and Missouri.
After making his debut on The Real World: San Diego in 2004, Brad became one of the show's most dominant male competitors, winning one season and making it to three additional finals. Brad last competed on the OG show in 2018 before joining All Stars in its second season, in which he was eliminated just before the final.
The 41-year-old has two sons with his ex-wife Tori Gwynn, whom he met on The Gauntlet III. After their divorce in 2016, Brad entered a brief romance with former Challenger Britni Thornton.
The reigning male champion is back to defend his title after The Real World: Philadelphia star won season two following a 12-year hiatus from the franchise.
The 42-year-old is married to Amanda Weaver (who starred as Mary Anne on The Real Gilligan's Island 2) and the couple have two daughters: Bella, 15, and Liv, 12.
After appearing on the inaugural season of All Stars, where she made it to the final, The Real World: Sydney vet is back for another shot at the title.
After last appearing on the OG show in 2015, the 35-year-old splits her time between Denver and California and is a yoga instructor and proud dog mom.
After disappointing exits in the first two All Stars seasons, Derrick is hoping for a win in his third spinoff outing after netting three wins during his Challenge career, establishing himself as one of the fiercest competitors.
The 38-year-old hosts the popular Challenge Mania podcast and is engaged to his longtime girlfriend Nicole Gruman.
The godfather is back in action.
During his run on the original show, Mark competed on six seasons, winning two of them, after his 1995 stint on Road Rules: USA – The First Adventure. Though he retired in 2012, the TV host is the person responsible for All Stars after starting the ""We Want OGs"" campaign in the summer of 2020. Respect your elders!
While the 50-year-old has a producer credit, he gave up all executive privileges when he signed on to compete in the inaugural season, though he still has big plans for the spinoff's future.
""This is my ultimate plan: We do many seasons of the OG, maybe seven or eight seasons, and then what you have is the most epic OG vs. new school Challenge,"" Mark revealed to E! News last year. ""It's the Super Bowl of Challenges.""
Following her big win in season two, All Stars' first female champion is back to defend her title. Hailing from The Real World: Cancun, Jonna appeared on five seasons of The Challenge, the last one being Battle of the Exes 2 in 2015.
The 34-year-old now has two children, daughter Naleigh, 6, and son Cal, 2, with her husband, Kevin. Jonna made it to the finals of season one just three months after welcoming her second child.
The Real World: Portland star is making her return to the franchise for the first time since 2015's Battles of the Sexes II after she was disqualified for inappropriate behavior.
The 33-year-old works as a private jet flight attendant and is dating her former Real World co-star (and onetime nemesis) Jordan Wiseley.
The Road Rules: Semester at Sea fan fave is making her All Stars debut after competing in 11 challenges, notching three wins during her career. The 44-year-old now works as an account executive and is mom to her three beloved dogs.
The first-ever female winner of The Challenge, Cynthia first debuted on The Real World: Miami in 1996 and made her last appearance on Battle of the Sexes II in 2005.
The 48-year-old is an event planner and jewelry designer and has one son.
The Road Rules: Campus Crawl vet is back for her third All Stars season after winning the only season of The Challenge she appeared on: 2004's The Inferno.
Since then, the 43-year-old got married, became a mom of three, began a career as a nurse and started practicing yoga, which has helped turn her into a major threat on the spinoff.
With four wins on the OG show and two appearances on All Stars, including a trip to the finals in season two, the Road Rules: Campus Crawl vet is hungry for the title.
When he's not on The Challenge, Darrell, 42, is a personal trainer and runs his own boxing gym, LB4LB Fitness, in Los Angeles. He married his longtime girlfriend Milasent Hernandez in 2017 and they have two children.
Will the third time be the charm for the Road Rules: Maximum Velocity Tour alum? Judging by the 45-year-old's intense workout regimen that he documents on social media, he is coming for the crown this season.
One of the most dominant competitors in the show's history, with three wins in six seasons, The Real World: Portland vet is making his All Stars debut following a hiatus from the franchise after he had, as he puts it in the May 11 premiere, ""said and done some things that I'm incredibly ashamed of. I'm remorseful, but I'm grateful for the path that its led me on and the lessons I've learned. I'm committed to showing that.""
After calling off his engagement to fellow Challenger Tori Deal in November of last year—Jordan memorably proposed after winning an elimination challenge during War of the Worlds 2—he reconnected with his former Real World housemate Nia Moore and the two are now dating. In addition to working as an actor, producer and clothing designer, the 31-year-old visited Ukraine to aid in humanitarian efforts in March.
The Real World: Boston fan favorite competed on five seasons of The Challenge, winning 2001's Extreme Challenge. Following his exit during season one of All Stars, the 50-year-old has dropped over 40 pounds, getting into the best shape of his life in order to take home the grand prize.
In addition to making appearances as a TV personality and his work as an activist, Syrus is engaged to his longtime girlfriend Stacy Elmer.
The Challenge: All Stars drops new episodes every Wednesday on Paramount+.

No one would ever dream to call Bridgerton's Queen Charlotte a damsel in distress.
But the first clip from spin-off, Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, proves she's a force to be reckoned with. Just one day after a first look image of actress India Amarteifio (Sex Education) as young Queen Charlotte hit the internet, now Netflix has dropped the first bit of footage during the streamer's TUDUM fan event.
In the clip (below), Charlotte attempts to climb a garden wall, trying to dodge the attentions of a handsome young man (Corey Mylchreest) who has interrupted her attempts to escape the palace. She explains that she is concerned the king may be a beast or a troll because no one will speak of him — only to discover that the man in question is also the one standing right before her.
The spin-off, which was first announced last year, boasts Shonda Rhimes as showrunner and writer. Golda Rosheuvel, who plays grown Queen Charlotte on Bridgerton proper, will reprise her role for the spin-off, as will Adjoa Andoh as the adult Lady Danbury, Ruth Gemmell as Violet Bridgerton, and Hugh Sachs as Brimsley.
Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story will chronicle ""how the young Queen's marriage to King George sparked both a great love story and a societal shift, creating the world of the Ton inherited by the characters in Bridgerton,"" according to a plot description.
The cast also features Michelle Fairley (Gangs of London) as Princess Augusta, Arsema Thomas as young Agatha Danbury, Sam Clemmett (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child) as young Brimsley, Freddie Dennis (The Nevers) as Reynolds, Richard Cunningham (The Witcher) as Lord Bute, Tunji Kasim (Nancy Drew) as Adolphus, Rob Maloney (Casualty) as the Royal Doctor, and Cyril Nri (Cucumber) as Lord Danbury.
Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz became a breakout character in the first season of the hit Netflix series. She was married to King George III, aka Mad King George, and ruled for nearly six decades. Charlotte died in 1818 at the age of 74.
As played by Rosheuvel and now Amarteifio, Charlotte reflects some historians belief that the real-life queen was of African descent.

In real life, Queen Charlotte, played by Golda Rosheuvel and thought by many historians to be the first biracial royal, was very involved in the social scene at the time. In fact, the first debutante ball was founded in 1780 by King George III in honor of his wife Charlotte's birthday. The royal couple was also thought to be deeply in love. Their relationship is touched upon briefly in season one. The King's mysterious illness is referenced in a few scenes where he is shown having aggressive outbursts. He also reacts with confusion when Charlotte tells him that she and his subjects ""miss"" him.
The monarch, who has been coined as the ""Mad King Who Lost America"" (thanks in part to the success of Broadway's Hamilton), likely battled bipolar disorder. In 2017, newly released documents shed light on the infamous King and his condition.
Here are four facts about the 18th-century monarch and his beloved wife, Queen Charlotte.
""He was a dedicated monogamous family man,"" says Karin Wulf, director of the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture and a history professor at the College of William & Mary. ""His family was everything to him. He spends so much time thinking of his children. He is so much more conscientious than people give him credit for. He is a thoughtful, considerate, moderate guy.""
Discovered among the papers was a poignant letter sent by Queen Charlotte to her children's nanny at the death of one of her younger sons, Alfred, at age two in 1782. Intricately tied up in a tiny folded piece of paper within the missive was a lock of golden curls.
His infamous ""madness,"" believed today to be bipolar disorder, was first detected post-revolution — and hinted at in the Hamilton line, ""If you leave I'll go mad!"" Says Wulf: ""That's clever, as he doesn't really show any signs of madness until after the revolution.""

0.2771084337349397,"Nolan's first biopic was one of the biggest films of the year.
Every few years, Christopher Nolan descends from the Mount Olympus of directors to deliver another must-see movie. His consistency rivals any living or legendary filmmaker. As a writer, director, and producer, he’s one of the most successful auteurs working in cinema, and he’s making blockbusters that match the scale of Spielberg’s or Kubrick’s classics. The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Memento: his body of work is a checkerboard of originality and adaptation.
Nolan's twelfth film will be a change of pace for his filmography; the director is writing and producing a biopic concerning the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer. For more about who that is, what the movie might be about, and the cast—so far—check out our breakdown of everything we know about Oppenheimer.
Editor's Note: This piece was updated on November 6, 2023.
The story of American scientist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and his role in the development of the atomic bomb.
Swiftly after Universal Studios announced its deal as the new distributor for the director’s films, they announced his new movie is set to be released on July 21, 2023. Oppenheimer will be Christopher Nolan's first R-rated film in 20 years. His last R-rating was for his 2002 film, Insomnia.
Oppenheimer was initially released exclusively in theaters, and was available in the standard digital cinema projection and in IMAX, 70mm, and 35mm formats. The film opened opposite another star-studded blockbuster from an auteur director in Greta Gerwig's Barbie; creating the worldwide phenomenon, Barbemheimer.
Nolan is also one of the most vocal proponents of celluloid film and the silver-screen experience. In March 2020, he wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post about the magic of movies and movie theaters. In the documentary Side By Side, which dissects the differences between celluloid film and digital cameras, his comments reveal him as a film purist. His commitment bleeds into the distribution of his pictures where he ensures a limited authentic film release—ala Quentin Tarantino. Even when almost literally every other film was pulled from release in 2020, Nolan and Warner were insistent on Tenet’s summer release. While it didn’t save cinema when Warner Bros forced its release amid the coronavirus pandemic in August 2020, it was another heady and action-packed picture by the Englishman. It was his lowest-grossing feature since The Prestige.
The director separated as a working partner with Warner shortly thereafter and assuredly became the hottest free agent on the market. Even Netflix tried their best to court the streaming service naysayer, their film chief Scott Stuber stating, “He’s an incredible filmmaker. I’m going to do everything I can.” But Nolan aligned with Universal for the release of his newest picture. The studio allegedly won favor by promising a six-week blackout surrounding the film’s release date where no other Universal properties are to be released, as well as by promising a 100-day exclusive theatrical release.
The full trailer for the film was released exclusively in theaters ahead of IMAX showings of Avatar: The Way of Water.
A different cut of the official trailer was released online on December 18, 2022. The trailer, which is narrated by Cillian Murphy teases a much more emotional and human film than some might have expected from a film about the creation of the nuclear bomb directed by Christopher Nolan but paired with Ludwig Göransson's score, that's what it feels like.
The second full trailer for Oppenheimer was initially released exclusively in movie theaters and played before IMAX screenings of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3. On May 8, 2023, Universal uploaded the trailer to their YouTube channel.
Universal released a five-minute video that gives us an in-depth look at the film. While it's not a proper trailer, this ""Opening Look"" does a terrific job of setting expectations for what's coming. A beautifully shot drama with an incredible score by Ludwig Göransson.
Oppenheimer was a scientist most famous for leading The Manhattan Project—the team that developed the atomic bomb for the United States of America in World War II. He later served as chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission where he worked to slow the developing nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union.
In 1954, Oppenheimer was branded a communist for his affiliation with multiple groups. He was relieved of service from the federal government and would continue his contributions to science as a teacher and groundbreaking theoretical physicist during his exile. He received three Nobel Prize nominations in physics from 1946 to 1967, though he never won one before his death in 1967.
The above clip highlights the production of Oppenheimer and Nolan's dedication to the IMAX format. If you weren't aware, a regular movie screen has a 16:9 aspect ratio, while IMAX’s exclusive 1.90:1 aspect ratio is roughly 26% larger. Most films reserve IMAX cameras for action set pieces, such as the final battle in an Avengers movie, but Nolan chose to shoot the entirety of Oppenheimer in IMAX. It was reported that the rolls of IMAX film that Nolan used to shoot Oppenheimer stretched to 11 miles long, weighing as much as 600 lbs.
Nolan explained why he loves shooting his films in IMAX.
Oppenheimer will only be available in 70mm in 30 theaters worldwide.
As previously mentioned, Christopher Nolan directed the film and wrote the screenplay. The acclaimed filmmaker also re-teamed with some of his previous collaborators. Academy Award Winner Ludwig Göransson who worked on the score for Tenet will compose Oppenheimer's score. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema who was the cinematographer for Interstellar, Dunkirk, and Tenet serves as the film's DP. Another returnee from Nolan's Tenet team is editor Jennifer Lame who has also worked on films such as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Manchester by the Sea, and Marriage Story. Ruth De Jong (Twin Peaks) serves as the film's production designer while Emmy Winner Ellen Mirojnick (Bridgerton) designed the costumes. Academy Award Winner Scott R. Fischer (Top Gun: Maverick) and Laurie Pellard (Avengers: Infinity War) are behind the film's visual effects.
Nolan's wife Emma Thomas is producing the film alongside her husband as well as Charles Roven, who previously worked with Nolan on The Dark Knight Trilogy.
""One of the first people I showed the script to was my visual effects supervisor, Andrew Jackson. He’s very well-versed in CG, but he’s also very well-versed in practical effects and understands the value of that. I showed it to him very early on, and I said, 'Okay, what we need in this film is a thread between the interior process of Oppenheimer, his imagining, his visualizing of atoms, molecules, those interactions, those energy waves. We need a thread that runs from that right through to the ultimate expression of the destructive power when that force is unleashed. It has to live in the same family.'""
Frequent Christopher Nolan accomplice Cillian Murphy (Peaky Blinders) is set to star as J. Robert Oppenheimer himself. Cillian collaborated with Nolan previously in The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, and most recently, Dunkirk.
Emily Blunt (A Quiet Place) reteams with Murphy, her co-star from A Quiet Place II, as Katherine Oppenheimer. Katherine was an activist and scientist, and one of many links between Oppenheimer and the communist ideology.
Academy Award Winner Matt Damon (The Martian) joined the cast as Lieutenant General Leslie Groves. Groves was the military director on the Manhattan Project, and he also oversaw the construction of the pentagon.
It was announced that Academy Award Nominee Robert Downey Jr.(Iron Man) joined the film as Lewis Strauss. Strauss and Oppenheimer found themselves on opposing sides of the debate about the development of the hydrogen bomb in late 1940. Like Oppenheimer, Strauss would go on to serve as chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission.
Academy Award Nominee Florence Pugh (Black Widow) is set to star as Jean Tatlock. Tatlock was one of several points of connection between Oppenheimer and communism, and the two were locked in an affair that would spark off and on for years.
It was also announced that Academy Award winner Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody) would play a scientist, and director and actor Benny Safdie (Goodtime) would play Edward Teller—a Hungarian physicist who helped create the first hydrogen bomb.
Oppenheimer also has a massive ensemble which includes Academy Award Nominee Tom Conti (The Dark Knight Rises) as Albert Einstein, Josh Hartnett (Penny Dreadful) as Ernest Lawrence, Dane DeHaan (Chronicle), Jack Quaid (The Boys), Matthew Modine (Stranger Things) as Vannevar Bush, Dylan Arnold (Halloween) as Frank Oppenheimer, Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story), as Richard Feynman, David Krumholtz (The Santa Clauses) as Isidor Isaac Rabi, Michael Angarano (Sky High) as Robert Serber, Academy Award Winner Kenneth Branagh (Death on the Nile), David Dastmalchian (The Suicide Squad), Jason Clarke (Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty), Josh Peck (Drake & Josh), as Kenneth Bainbridge, Devon Bostick (Diary of a Wimpy Kid) as Seth Neddermeyer, Alex Wolff (Hereditary), Tony Goldwyn (King Richard), Academy Award Winner Gary Oldman (Darkest Hour) as Harry S. Truman, Academy Award Winner Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea), Scott Grimes (The Orville), Josh Zuckerman (The Offer), James D'Arcy (Dunkirk), Matthias Schweighöfer (Army of the Dead), Christopher Denham (The Gilded Age) as Klaus Fuchs, David Rysdahl (No Exit), Guy Burnet (Pitch Perfect 3) as Guy Eltenton, Danny Deferrari (Shiva Baby) as Enrico Fermi, Louise Lombard (CSI: Crime Scene Investigation), Harrison Gilbertson (Need for Speed), Emma Dumont (Licorice Pizza) as Jackie Oppenheimer, Gustaf Skarsgård (Vikings) as Hans Bethe, Trond Fausa (Lilyhammer), Olli Haaskivi (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier), and Olivia Thirlby (Juno).
Pre-production on Oppenheimer began in January 2022 in New Mexico and filming kicked off a month later. Filming wrapped the following May. To truly capture the atmosphere, Nolan revealed how they were able to shoot some of the film's fiery scenes.
""I mean, I've done a lot of explosions in a lot of films. But there is something very unique and particular about being out in a desert in the middle of the night with a big cast, and really just doing some enormous explosions and capturing that. You couldn't help but come back to this moment when they were doing this on the ultimate scale, that in the back of their minds they knew there was this possibility that they would set fire to the atmosphere. It was pretty amazing to engage in that kind of tension.""

""Your ghosts follow you. They live with you.""","Christopher Nolan is going nuclear. No, he’s not (still) upset about Tenet’s pandemic-era release (though he did permanently abandon ex-BFF Warner Bros., which he believes bungled the palindrome movie’s release). His next film, Oppenheimer, follows the titular J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the theoretical physicists credited with being the “father of the atomic bomb,” and his role in the Manhattan Project — ya know, the top-secret nuclear research and development program ran by the U.S. government to develop the apocalyptic weapons. The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize–winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin.
Nolan partnered with Universal Pictures to finance and distribute the film, which he also wrote and directed, after ditching Warner Bros. — with whom he made the Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, Dunkirk, and Tenet — over the latter film’s aforementioned release. But that doesn’t mean he’s ditching his Nolan-y aesthetics. Like his previous flicks, it’s an event film. Think fiery explosions and pensive landscape long shots and Cillian Murphy voice-over and an obsession with the mysteries of space-time, all captured on Imax large-format film by previous collaborator Hoyte Van Hoytema. Plus, music by Tenet’s (and Black Panther’s) Ludwig Göransson. Below, the mind-blowing trailer, cast, plot, and release-date details for Oppenheimer.
A movie about nuclear research and armament’s gotta have a trailer befitting the topic. The latest shows a man more assured that the destruction power of the bomb is a necessary evil. “We’re in a race against Nazis, and I know what it means if the Nazis have a bomb,” he says. “We have one hope.” Oppenheimer sits at a postwar congressional hearing at the end of the trailer, realizing the gravity of what they created. In the first full look from December 2022, we saw an Oppenheimer who, despite creating the incredibly destructive weapon, seems a little concerned about its deployment. The very first shot is the blaze of a detonated nuke, followed by a close-up of the embattled scientist’s eyes and falling rain. “We imagine a future, and our imaginings horrify us,” he says in voice-over as researchers assemble the bomb. “They won’t fear it until they understand it. And they won’t understand it until they’ve used it.” He doesn’t know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. “But we have no choice,” he contends.
An all-star cast. Cillian Murphy, longtime Nolan collaborator (Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, Dunkirk) and Peaky Blinders star, plays Oppenheimer. Plus, there’s Emily Blunt, best known (by me) for The Devil Wears Prada, and, more recently, for her turn in The Quiet Place. She plays Oppenheimer’s wife, Katherine. The most unbothered star of this year’s Venice Film Festival (Florence Pugh, duh) — remember when she strutted the carpet in a purple matching set clutching an Aperol spritz during a worrying press tour? — appears in the film as Jean Tatlock, a psychiatrist and physician who has a complicated relationship with the titular character. Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. is Lewis Strauss, a businessman and philanthropist who became a major figure in the development of the bomb.
Academy Award–winning actors Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting) and Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody) star as well, with the former playing Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves. Uncut Gems’ Benny Safdie is Edward Teller, a Hungarian physicist. Shakespeare enthusiast Kenneth Branagh appears as well, alongside Josh Hartnett, Dane DeHaan, Jack Quaid, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, David Krumholtz, and Michael Angarano.

If half of Hollywood took a role in Barbie, then the other half got a job in Nolan’s Oppenheimer.
Not CGI. The film re-creates the first-ever nuclear-weapon detonation without the use of computer graphics for filming purposes. Visual-effects supervisor Andrew Jackson had to rack his brain on how to film the effects “practically, from representing quantum dynamics and quantum physics to the Trinity test itself, to re-creating, with my team, Los Alamos up on a mesa in New Mexico in extraordinary weather, a lot of which was needed for the film, in terms of the very harsh conditions out there — there were huge practical challenges,” he told Total Film. We still don’t know how exactly he created the look-alike bomb, but we will soon.
The film blasts into theaters July 21, 2023.

0.5714285714285714,"Whoopi Goldberg isn't spending time dwelling on Barbara Corcoran's body-shaming joke, which the Shark Tank shark made on last week's The View.
A TMZ cameraperson caught up with Goldberg in New York City as she was heading to her car, and asked if she took ""offense,"" over Corcoran saying — after a segment on jeans — that Goldberg should send her her old jeans when she's done, and Corcoran would make two pairs out of them.
Corcoran turned to social media following her appearance on the The View last Thursday, apologizing for the barb.
""I made a joke at Whoopi's expense, which I now realize wasn't funny,"" Corcoran tweeted on October 7. ""For anyone who I may have offended unintentionally, I just wanted to say I really am very sorry.""
Asked by TMZ's reporter if she accepted Corcoran's apology, Goldberg said it wasn't necessary.
""She doesn't have to — you know, this is the lady who threw away her birthday party to get into a coffin,"" Goldberg said, making reference to Corcoran's 70th birthday event in 2019, where the shark began the evening in an actual coffin.
""So Barbara's always been funny and weird,"" Goldberg continued. ""And that's who she is. And no, it takes a lot more to offend me.""
Before she parted ways with the cameraperson to carry on her day, Goldberg noted that she and the investor go way, way back.
""I've known her too long. We've known each other 25 years,"" Goldberg said.

Barbara Corcoran offered an apology after making fun of Whoopi's size during the Oct. 7 episode of the daytime show.
The group was chatting about a ""great"" pair of jeans, when Whoopi asked, ""Well, I have to try them. Will they fit this COVID [butt]?""
After getting confirmation, she said, ""OK, just thought I would ask... OK, if they fit three, no, two COVID butts, we'll be fine.""
That's when Barbara made an insensitive joke that body shamed the longtime co-host. ""When you get finished with those jeans and decide you don't like them, give them to me—and I'm gonna make two pairs,"" remarked the 72-year-old Shark Tank star.
Whoopi appeared speechless. She didn't smile and instead raised her arms in a shrug.
Co-star Ana Navarro stuck up for Whoopi by dishing out a diss of her own. ""Wait, wait, let me just tell you something,"" she said. ""Sara Haines and Jill Biden wore that dress already on TV.""
Barbara responded, ""That's not true!""
She later shared a video on Twitter to apologize for her comments, which had social media users ""so disappointed"" by the ""nasty"" jab. Barbara told fans, ""I just came back from The View and saw my old friend Whoopi. As you well know, she has a phenomenal sense of humor and I've known Whoopi for years.""
The self-described ""NYC Real Estate Queen"" went on, ""I made a joke at Whoopi's expense, which I now realize wasn't funny. For anyone who I may have offended unintentionally, I just wanted to say I really am very sorry."" She captioned her apology video, ""Love ya Whoopi.""
Social media users weren't so quick to forgive. ""It's always so sad when someone screws up an otherwise perfect apology by saying some crap like 'to anyone who I may have offended,'"" one wrote. ""It's not up for debate. You offended. You may or may not have 'intended' to, but there's no doubt, what you said was offensive. Period.""
Another told her, ""When you're on stage with a EGOT & world class comedian... leave the jokes to the pro.""
However, Whoopi appeared to accept Barbara's apology. ""Barbara we have been friends forever and I know your humor,"" she tweeted on Oct. 8. ""I knew you were kidding.""

0.2666666666666666,"'The Blacklist' returns to NBC in its Season 3 premiere on Thursday, October 1st.
In the first-ever episode of Collider Video's 'The Blacklist Recap Show', John Campea, Kat Endsley, Xavier Brinkman, and Wendy Lee discuss the hit NBC series, The Blacklist. Starring James Spader as infamous criminal mastermind Raymond ""Red"" Reddington and Megan Boone as super-agent Elizabeth Keen, the new season of The Blacklist will follow their flight from authorities after the shocking conclusions of the Season 2 finale.
With The Blacklist ready to return for Season 3 on NBC Thursday, October 1st, the Collider Video team is here to get viewers caught up with the show so far. They'll be back each and every week to recap new episodes, respond to the craziness that's sure to occur, and maybe even field a question or two from The Blacklist fans out there.
James Spader (Age of Ultron) stars in NBC’s The Blacklist as Raymond Reddington, a criminal on FBI’s most wanted list. Upon surrendering himself to the FBI, he makes a deal - he’ll give FBI a list of the world’s most dangerous criminals. But there’s a catch… He’ll only speak to Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone). Agent Keen partners with Reddington to bring down one dangerous criminal after another, while trying to figure out why Reddington will only work with her.
In season 2, Elizabeth uncovers that her mother was a famous agent of the Russian intelligence agency KGB, and in handing The Director the Fulcrum has marked her an enemy of The Cabal. Refusing Reddington’s advice to run, Elizabeth continues with her task of stopping assassin Karakurt from infecting Senator Hawkins.
The season 2 finale ends with Elizabeth on the run. Framed by The Cabal, she infected Senator Hawkins with a deadly virus - ultimately leading to his death. Coming face-to-face with Cabal member Tom Connolly, Elizabeth confronts him, telling him to make all of it go away. Connolly refuses and threatens not only Elizabeth but her entire task team, leading to her to pull the trigger and kill him. This puts Elizabeth on FBI’s most wanted list, her own FBI teammates are looking to hunt her down and she must team up with Reddington and get out of DC.
Don't let them catch you.
You can catch the next episode early, ahead of the Super Bowl.
The Apple TV+ series premieres this May.
This new series is building to a historic battle that is best when seen through the eyes of the iconic Hiroyuki Sanada.
The series is coming to an end soon.","It's not news that The Blacklist's soundtracking team is one of the best in the biz. This has been established time and time again, often with Johnny Cash (and once with a George Ezra song that prompted me to create a Pandora station I basically haven't switched from since I heard it rocked my Blacklist world months ago). But it will be quite some time before I get over the perfect inclusion of Greg Laswell's ""Dodged a Bullet"" in the final scenes of Thursday night's season 3 finale. Given that the chorus above could apply to just about any of our main characters — Red, Tom, Cooper, but most especially, Mr. Kaplan and her backfiring plan — it's particularly fitting that it repeats itself about 30 times in Mr. Laswell's track.
Over and over, the most important people in Elizabeth Keen's life attempt to protect her — keep her out of harm's way, shield her from her past, keep her off the FBI's Most Wanted list, give her fancy DC lofts with more exposed brick than she could have possibly dreamed. And over and over again all they seem to do is endanger her more. Because whether it is because of Red or in spite of Red…because of working with the Post Office or in spite of it…because of having a baby with Tom Keen or in spite of it…Liz's past is coming for her. Many powerful people have gone to many great lengths to protect Liz from a danger they may not even understand, and yet here she is…tied to a chair, looking into Alexander Kirk's blue eyes that look so much like her own and hearing him say, ""Masha — I'm your father.""
Oh, I should probably mention…Liz is alive. To which you all yell in unison, ""I KNEW IT!!!"" Of course we did! And some of us may have even guessed that Alexander Kirk would turn out to be her father (or her uncle or her brother or whoever he turned out to be, I would have assured myself that I knew it all along if the thought had ever spent a fleeting moment in my mind). So, I'm going to borrow a sentiment from the Mr. Kaplan School of Tricky Business here and say that ""the how won't change anything."" How we got to an alive Liz meeting her alleged father — that we had to navigate a real-life maternity leave with a fake-death maternity leave; that we were either shocked by its twists or smug in our correctness; whether we enjoyed being toyed with or were simply biding our time until that middle parted bob graced our screens once more — doesn't really matter. It matters that we've gotten here at all: ""Masha, I'm your father.""
Thursday's finale opened on the titular Alexander Kirk speaking with a handful of advisers about his current predicament: Raymond Reddington has stolen all the money he'd contributed to Senator Diaz' presidential campaign and convinced the man to announce to the world that he's putting said campaign on pause to go after Alexander Kirk, a man financing terrorism, and force him to answer for his actions. But here's the real kicker: All this stuff about Kirk financing terrorism — totally false. Sure the guy's bad news, what with all the baby kidnapping and what not, but he's not buying oil from terrorists and bringing it into the United States like Diaz is telling people he is.
But if Raymond Reddington has anything to do with it, those false charges of transporting terrorist's oil will be made true via a classic Tom Keen heist, a dummy oil tank switcharoo worthy of Fast Five, one super cute dog, and one sleeve of gas station powdered doughnuts.
But even for all that excitement, frankly, the stakes on the will-Red-or-won't-Red kill Kirk to avenge Liz's death stuff remain pretty low for the majority of the episode, as it's not until the last 20 seconds that we're given any reason to care much if he does, in fact, live or die. I've long given up on pretending that any of these characters are as principled as they think they are — that includes you, Ressler — but what the mission to draw Kirk out, and the subsequent hunt to kill him does bring us are a couple of excellent scenes with a few more than excellent actors.
After Red does successfully frame Kirk for funding terrorism and seems to have gotten him to come in person to his trial with Diaz, Cooper and Ressler are forced to reckon with the gun they've helped shoot in an attempt to dodge a bullet: Red is going to kill Alexander Kirk. Cooper, for one, seems fine with settling the score for Liz's death, leading Red to give him this tear-inducing bit of validation: ""I know so many zealots, men and women, who choose a side, an ideology by which to interpret the world. But to get up every single day and do the hard work of deciding what to believe; what's right today; when to stand up or stand down… that's courage. It's been a privilege to see first-hand why the people you lead love you the way you do.""
Tom helps with a bit of the framing Kirk business as part of his agreement with Red that if Red is going to be in Agnes' life, Tom gets to help bring down the man who killed Liz. But mostly he spends his time watching over his infant daughter with the help of Mr. Kaplan and her regular entourage of guards. At Red's request she's set up some sort of creepy soundstage nursery in the middle of a warehouse. I get that it's to protect her from Kirk, who is very obviously after her (just ask the Fargo-esque omnipotent assassin who keeps popping up on Tom's tail), but I don't enjoy the idea of Agnes growing up in a fake bedroom. But it looks like that needn't be a worry after all because Tom just gave Mr. Kaplan the slip while grocery shopping, whisking Agnes off in a getaway car to a private plane.
But Kirk's tale is at the runway and quickly learns that Tom and Agnes are headed to Cuba, and so, and as his mission is to kill Tom and get Agnes at all costs, he's also headed to Cuba… and so is Alexander Kirk, as Red learns once his aimed gun goes un-shot when Kirk never gets out of the vehicle for his hearing. Red tracks Kirk's rerouted flight to Baracoa, Cuba, then gets Aram to search any other Americans who flew there in the past six hours, finds Tom Keen, and then finds that man who loaned Tom the plane. He's an associate of Red's and he tells him he never would have given Tom the plane if he'd known it would cause Red to dangle him 40 feet over a driving range — he simply assumed that when Mr. Kaplan asked for the plane for Tom Keen's escape, she was asking on Red's behalf.

Okay, and now we get it out of our systems, altogether now: WE KNEW IT!!! But before we get to what many have been so certain would happen since Lizzie ""died"" (y'know, unless of course, it didn't happen), we must address the fantastic scene between James Spader and Susan Blommaert. Red and Mr. Kaplan's struggle to remain in opposition to one another after being in such a steadfast partnership for decades was heart-wrenching to behold — both of their faces, nearly unmoving, said so much about the strength it took for Kaplan to defy Red, and the equally unbearable way in which it broke him. As Red tells ""Kate,"" he has ""no parables about loyalty, no florid speeches"" with which to explain her betrayal. And so she explains it for him: ""What do you want to know, Raymond? If I'm sorry? Yes. I'm sorry you weren't more honest with Elizabeth from the beginning. I'm sorry that you wanted to know her so desperately that you convinced yourself we could keep her safe. I couldn't sit back and watch you make the same mistake with Agnes. I didn't betray you. I did what I've always done: I protected you — this time, from yourself.""
But instead, Mr. Kaplan fired the gun. Because despite the perfectly executed fake death of Elizabeth Keen (the details of which I'll leave to Dr. Nick and his medical jargon montage), and despite the heaven-like villa Liz has apparently been living in since she fled the U.S. to Cuba, Tom's arrival to what should have been their paradise — ""We did it; we're free!"" — led Alexander Kirk right to what he's been hunting: Elizabeth Keen and her daughter Agnes. Tom arrives home to find men inside their happily-ever-after villa, and let me tell you what, you haven't seen Tom Keen fight, until you've seen him fight for his daughter's safety. But he's still no match.
And the next thing we see is Liz in a chair, demanding from a blurry figure to know where her daughter is. He steps out of the dark, slowly coming into focus, as if emerging from a foggy memory. He greets her: ""Hello Masha."" It's been a long time since we've spent any time with Liz, and one must assume Megan Boone was quite tired at the time of filming these final scenes, but the tiny expression she gives in response to her birth name from Alexander Kirk's mouth is just perfect — that hesitant look of childlike curiosity that could easily double as recognition. He tells her that he's been waiting for this moment for the past 25 years, that his name is Alexander Kirk: ""But it wasn't always. Once, a long time ago, my name was Constantine Rosov.""
As always, it's been a pleasure to watch along with you — thank you for reading, and please do sound off in the comments with your most insane theories, wild predictions, and florid speeches regarding season 4!",Collider,Ew,,,
0.5,"Sebastian Stan is working with extensive makeup and prosthetics for his new movie A Different Man.
On Wednesday, Stan, 39, was spotted on the Brooklyn, New York, set of the upcoming film from A24 in full makeup and prosthetics rendering the actor unrecognizable.
In the film, Stan plays a character named Edward who has neurofibromatosis and undergoes ""major facial reconstruction surgery"" and then grows obsessed with an actor who plays him in a stage play based on Edward's life, according to Variety and Entertainment Weekly.
The upcoming film, currently filming in New York City, is written and directed by Aaron Schimberg. A Different Man also stars Norwegian actress Renate Reinsve, who starred in 2021's The Worst Person in the World, and Adam Pearson, an actor who has neurofibromatosis and appeared in 2013's Under the Skin.
Last Thursday, Stan posted a still image of him in makeup for A Different Man on Instagram for a close-up look at the prosthetics at work from Mike Marino, who also did the prosthetics for Colin Farrell as the Penguin in this year's The Batman.
Neurofibromatosis, the condition Stan's character has in A Different Man, is caused by ""a group of genetic disorders that cause tumors to form on nerve tissue,"" according to the Mayo Clinic.
In July, Stan received an Emmy nomination for outstanding actor in a limited series or movie for his performance as Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee in the Hulu limited series Pam & Tommy alongside Lily James as Pamela Anderson.
In March, Stan detailed the research and psychological transformation he underwent for his role in the Hulu film Fresh, in which he plays a duplicitous and deranged killer named Steve.
Stan said he watched a lot of true-crime documentaries and sought out one particular expert for her insight into specific criminals for the part.
""I saw this documentary Crazy, Not Insane by Alex Gibney which focused on this psychiatrist, Dr. Dorothy Otnow Lewis and I tracked her down,"" Stan said in March. ""I very much geeked out because she had seen so much and has so much experience with serial killers, but also multiple personality disorder types of subjects. I asked her a lot of questions, 'Do you think this could have happened? If you see someone with this sort of a pattern, what does it say about them? Where does one develop that?' And so that part of [the research] was really interesting because she just knew so much.""

No one knows the ins and outs of the entertainment business quite like the actor and longtime talk show host. However, even Hollywood pros make mistakes. And back in 2015, the Family Feud host had a major snafu—on live television, no less—when he announced the wrong Miss Universe winner.
The moment became infamous and it's something Steve described as ""the worst week of my life"" when speaking on SiriusXM's Comedy Gold Minds with Kevin Hart podcast on April 7. According to the 64-year-old star, the mix-up wasn't his fault.
""They said, 'We'll announce the second runner-up, and then we'll have standing there the first runner-up, and Miss Universe, and we'll do it that way,'"" he recalled ahead of crowning the new winner. ""Well, the lady that did the show when [Donald] Trump owned it, she decided on the night of, after two days of rehearsal, I'm putting the third name on there, and they printed it on the card.""
He continued, ""Well, in the teleprompter after I announced the second runner-up, the teleprompter said, 'And the new 2015 Miss Universe is...' The dude in my ear, said, 'Read the next name on the card, Steve. Hold, hold, hold.' I looked at the next card. I said, 'Miss Colombia!' That white boy said, 'Good job, Steve. Go to the back.'""
During the beauty pageant, Steve announced Miss Colombia, Ariadna Gutiérrez, as the 2015 Miss Universe.
But minutes later, the host shocked viewers and audiences alike when he came back on stage and corrected his error, saying the real winner was, in fact, Miss Philippines, Pia Wurtzbach.
Steve revealed to Kevin Hart that he actually only learned about his blunder after someone from his team told him, ""Big dog, you said the wrong name.""
""I said, 'Man, the f--k you talking about? I didn't say the wrong name, I read the name that was on the f--king card,'"" the talk show host recalled of his conversation. ""'... I said, 'Bitch, ain't nobody told me! Hold up, hold up. No, dog.' I'm really back there cussing.""
The Steve Harvey Show host claimed the Miss Universe team originally wanted to correct the error the next day. However, he made the decision to ""go out"" on stage ""and fix it.""
""I took my stupid ass back out there,"" he shared. ""I should have let them announce it the next day in the newspaper. I wouldn't have caught none of the hell I caught.""
The Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man author opened up about the aftermath of his snafu, saying, ""It was a painful ass night there, dog. I didn't know the pain I was in. I didn't know how bad the mistake was...""
""You know, I knew it was bad when it happened, and really it wasn't my fault..."" he explained, adding, ""When I woke up the next morning, it was everywhere. It was the headline in every country. And it was the worst week of my life, man, in show business.""
According to Steve, people were driving by his home in Atlanta, Ga. and ""throwing rocks"" at his gate with the word ""puta"" written on notes. The term can hold several meanings in Spanish, including bitch, slut, motherf--ker and more.
""I don't know Spanish, but I know 'puta.' They call you 'puta' a lot of times,"" he said. ""I know that ain't good because it was 'puta' in all the notes and all the texts.""
Just four months ago, Miss Colombia reflected on the infamous moment in an exclusive interview with E! News.
""I'm in awe that something so crazy and beyond reality could ever happen to me,"" Ariadna shared in December 2020. ""It's crazy that it actually happened. It sounds like it's from a movie or something.""
""In the beginning, I was devastated,"" she admitted. ""It was my dream since I was a little girl. Imagine having your biggest dream come true, and then somebody just takes it away from you.""
Ariadna has since moved on from the incident and revealed she's actually close with both Steve and his wife Marjorie Bridges.
""I love him, and it wasn't his fault,"" she said. ""It was just an accident or destiny—whatever you want to call it. It wasn't ever about him. People think that I hated him, that I have so much anger and hatred towards him. I never hated him. Throughout the competitions and rehearsals, I was his No. 1 fan.""

She joined EW in August 2022.
In hindsight, Ryan Reynolds should've known better than to ask the Greatest Showman for performance tips.
The Deadpool actor revealed that he tapped his longtime ""nemesis"" Hugh Jackman — who is currently marching down Broadway in The Music Man — for guidance on how to sing and dance for Spirited, his new Christmas musical with Will Ferrell. But the results didn't exactly fill Reynolds up with holiday cheer.
""It comes so naturally to Hugh that, in a weird way, his helping was not helping,"" Reynolds said in an interview with Big Issue. ""He was like, 'Just make sure you're listening to those count-offs and those beats'. And I was like, 'I don't hear the beats, man. Help me out with something real here!'""
The best lesson Jackman taught him didn't actually take place on the dance floor, but rather over a cup of coffee. ""He reminded me of something that is so vital with almost anything that you're doing in the arts,"" Reynolds recalled. ""He said, 'Just remember to enjoy it, because if you're enjoying it, we'll enjoy it.'""
He continued, ""That was something that I constantly reminded myself. Even when I felt so out of my depth, which was almost every day, I kept reminding myself that this is an opportunity of a lifetime. And it actually extended well beyond this project into other aspects of my life. So that was pretty good advice.""
Reynolds is no stranger to learning choreography — just check out any of his gleefully gruesome Deadpool fight scenes — but the actor maintains that dance routines were an entirely different kind of evil.
""Training for a superhero movie is something I've been doing since I was 20, and I'm 46 now,"" he said. ""Doing a fight sequence is in my bones. I memorize them very fast. I can make a mistake and use that mistake to my advantage in the moment. Whereas dancing, if I make one mistake, I completely fall apart.""
In a way, the Apple TV+ film was just what Reynolds needed to push himself out of his comfort zone.
""The great gift about getting older is you become more and more comfortable with sucking at something,"" he said. ""The more comfortable I am at sucking at something, the better I become at that thing. If I'm looking through the lens of, this has to have perfection right off the bat, it becomes a law of diminishing returns. When you allow yourself to be bad at something, it really gives yourself permission to be good at it as well.""
Reynolds added, ""[In Spirited], I wasn't trying to be the best singer on the planet. I was trying to be the best singer I could possibly be. And that's it. And that's all I can do. I can't really control much else.""
Based on Charles Dickens' classic holiday tale A Christmas Carol, the movie follows Reynolds' character Clint Briggs, an ""unredeemable"" curmudgeon who runs a controversial social media company, as he's visited by the Ghost of Christmas Present (Ferrell) and forced to sing and dance his way through an unforgettably jolly journey.
Spirited is streaming now on Apple TV+. Meanwhile, Reynolds and Jackman will reunite on screen in the upcoming third Deadpool installment, which is set to hit theaters Nov. 8, 2024.

0.3333333333333333,"Evangeline Lilly, who got her start as an actress on Lost, tells PEOPLE that she plans to eventually ""sit down and do a Lost marathon""
Evangeline Lilly admits she has a hard time reliving the earlier days of her acting career.
The 42-year-old actress, who landed her first leading role when she was cast as Kate Austen in Lost, reveals she's never seen most of the series that made her a star!
""I cringe watching every single episode of the first 2 seasons when they were airing back in 2005,"" Lilly, who chatted with PEOPLE this week about her new film South of Heaven, says. ""Because it was my first acting gig ever, and I really didn't know what I was doing, and I was so bad in so many moments. I was so cringe-worthy.""
Lilly was so turned off by her performance that every time she thinks of going back to watch the ABC drama, she ""would have to skip to season 3 when I started to get the hang of what to do as an actor and it won't be quite so humiliating,"" she says.
""But the truth is,"" she admits, ""I never actually watched seasons 4, 5, 6. So I still have to watch it for the first time.""
The Ant-Man and the Wasp star portrayed Kate Austen on Lost, the cult series from J.J. Abrams, over its entire six-season run from 2004 until 2010.
When asked whether she thinks she will ever get around to watching the seasons she's never seen, Lilly responds, ""I think I will.""
""I think I will definitely at some point sit down and do a Lost marathon, and I think hopefully I imagine there will have been enough space that it will just be the most beautiful walk down memory lane and really put a big smile on my face remembering all the people and all the places and you know all the memories that were made on that show,"" she continues.

""It was a very intense time for all of us, and the memories are — they mean a lot to me at this point,"" Lilly adds. ""It's become such a beloved treasure in my life.""
The actress can currently be seen in the new film South of Heaven, opposite Ted Lasso star Jason Sudeikis.
For her role in the new crime thriller, she completely committed to a bleached blonde look, so much so that her hair ended up taking quite the toll.
The actress exclusively told PEOPLE this week that both she and director Aharon Keshales wanted her character Annie Ray to look like ""sunshine and the source of life"" throughout the film. ""[Keshales] wanted her to be this glowing representation of life,"" she said.
So becoming a blonde seemed like the best fit. Instead of wearing a wig every day for shooting, Lilly agreed to bleach her dark brunette hair platinum. But it wasn't an easy process.
""I chose for her to have the naturally blonde hair and a kind of warmer complexion so that she would look glowing, healthy, vibrant and full of life,"" Lilly said. ""But that upkeep became really arduous because I wanted her to look like she was a natural blonde.""
Lilly wore her hair in a short, buzzed cut so ""it was so short [that] if it grew out by even a millimeter, you could see it,"" she said. ""I was bleaching my hair every 10 days, and by the end of the shoot, it was falling out.""
South of Heaven is out now.

From 2004 to 2010, the 38-year-old actress played airplane crash survivor Kate Austen for six seasons on ABC's Lost—and in the July 31 episode of The Lost Boys podcast, she shared some behind-the-scenes stories from the set. The role changed Lilly's life, even though she never aspired to be famous. ""I would say it was my destiny, because it certainly wasn't my agenda. I was one of those very rare, rare actresses who wasn't trying to be an actress when I got that job,"" she explained. ""And the only reason why I took the job at the time was because I had enormous faith, and I really believed that everything in my life just continued to sort of push and prod me and point me towards this thing. Then it happened so quickly—it happened so easily!—that it felt like destiny. It felt like, 'I can't say no to this, or I'm saying no to my fate.'""
To the host's surprise, Lilly said she ""always"" thought her character ""was obnoxious.""
Backtracking a bit, the actress said, ""At the beginning, she was kind of cool. And then as the show went on, I felt like she became more and more predictable and obnoxious. I felt like my character went from being autonomous—really having her own story and her own journey and her own agendas—to chasing to men around the island. And that irritated the s--t out of me.""
Once Kate's main storyline became centered on her love triangle with Jack (Matthew Fox) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway), Lilly grew restless with her role. ""I did throw scripts across rooms when I'd read them,"" she said, ""because I would get very frustrated by the diminishing amount of autonomy she had and the diminishing amount of her own story there was to play."" Lilly clarified that she wasn't ""opposed to having romance in a woman's life."" In fact, she said, ""I've never been able to be single; I'm one of those unfortunate women who goes from relationship to relationship. So, there's nothing wrong with women's lives being characterized by their relationships; I think that often happens to men and women. But, there was this eventual lack of dimension to what was going on with her. It was just really, 'Jack? Sawyer? Jack? Sawyer?""
In the show's final seasons, especially, ""I wanted her to be better, because she was an icon for strength and autonomy for women, and I thought we could have done better than that,"" she said. ""I think we did well. I think I tried very, very hard to take what I was given and always find the way to shower her strength, find the way to have her own thoughts and opinions and ideas, and to take moments that I thought might be a bit whiny and somehow make them not whiny.""
As an example, Lilly cited the episode in which Kate chased after Jack—and the Others captured her, held her hostage and used her as a bargaining chip. ""That irritated the s--t out of me, because I felt like her chasing after Jack seemed so immature, and I wanted her to be better,"" she said. ""But the great thing about that is that she was flawed, and that's so important. If you don't have flaws in the women onscreen, then you're telling the world that women have to be perfect if they're going to be lovable. If you have flawed women onscreen who are also icons of femininity, who are also beloved, then it gives us all permission to be flawed. In a way, the things that irritated me about her were probably totally necessary—and important, even.""
Unfortunately, those weren't the only tough times Lilly faced on the show's set.
""In Season 3, I'd had a bad experience on set with being basically cornered into doing a scene partially naked, and I felt had no choice in the matter. I was mortified and I was trembling, and when it finished, I was crying my eyes out and I had to go on do a very formidable, very strong scene immediately thereafter,"" the actress recalled. ""And so, in Season 4, another scene came up where Kate was undressing, and I fought very hard to have that scene be under my control, and I failed to control it again. And so, I then said, 'That's it. No more. You can write whatever you want—[but] I won't do it. I will never take my clothes off on this show again.' And I didn't.""
Lilly added that she would handle the situation differently today. ""I've been doing this for nearly 15 years, so I kind of know the ropes,"" she said. ""I'm a little bit better equipped now to not have uncomfortable experiences come up."" Now, when she reads scripts that involve nudity, she passes. ""And it's not because I think there's anything wrong with doing nudity. It's because I don't trust that I can be comfortable and safe,"" said Lilly, who currently stars in Ant-Man and the Wasp. ""I'm lucky. I'm in a position—a very privileged position—where I'm allowed to be picky. I can be picky. I've got enough success under my belt that I can be, and I feel for women who are just struggling to come up in the industry and don't really know how to navigate that.""
Working on Lost wasn't all bad, of course, and Lilly particularly enjoyed sharing scenes with Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn. ""Their immovability in a scene taught me about not bending to make my co-stars comfortable—which I think is a quintessentially female trait, to always try to accommodate and take care of whoever you're with,"" she said. ""But they were never selfish, unkind or egotistical. They were just very strong and talented. They were pros and they weren't going to apologize for what they needed to do to accomplish their scenes.""
After Lilly's interview went viral, Lost co-creators and executive producers J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof, and executive producers Jack Bender and Carlton Cuse, apologized to the star. ""Our response to Evie's comments this morning in the media was to immediately reach out to her to profoundly apologize for the experience she detailed while working on Lost,"" the four men told E! News in a joint statement Thursday night. ""We have not yet connected with her, but remain deeply and sincerely sorry. No person should ever feel unsafe at work. Period.""

0.5,"Although Bri Stauss and Chris Watson have gone their separate ways, the Bachelor: Listen to Your Heart winners are looking back on their relationship with nothing but love.
In a joint statement shared to their respective Instagram accounts on Thursday, the former couple addressed their split after nearly a year of dating, saying that although they are no longer together, they ""have a special bond that we will cherish forever.""
""Hey fam. It pains us to say this, but we have made the difficult decision to go our separate ways,"" the statement begins.
""We met and fell in love in the most beautiful and unique way, and because of that, we have a special bond that we will cherish forever,"" the statement continues. ""Thank you for the love and support to our fans, friends, family, and in particular, Bachelor Nation. You made this entire experience so special and unforgettable.""
Though the pair has parted ways, they said that they ""still hope to make music and tour together in the future, but for now we ask for privacy as we navigate the next chapter. Love you forever, Chris and Bri.""
Stauss, 28, and Watson, 30, captured hearts in the musical and romantic Bachelor spinoff competition series that aired in April 2020. They released two albums throughout their relationship: Chris and Bri in May 2020, which told their love story, and their December holiday album, Wrapped Under the Tree.
When their Christmas album was released, they seemed to suggest that they might continue making music as a band.
""We look forward to sharing more updates with you all as we navigate our future making music together. Thank you all for your love, support and privacy,"" they said on their joint Instagram last month.
On Tuesday, the duo revealed their split. ""With deep admiration and respect for one another, we have decided to end our relationship and go our separate ways,"" they said in a statement to E! Online, adding that they ""will always look back on our journey with deep fondness, and will continue to support each other both personally and professionally.""

E! News has exclusively learned the winning couple from The Bachelor: Listen to Your Heart has decided to split after about one year of dating.
In a joint statement to E! News, Bri and Chris said, ""With deep admiration and respect for one another, we have decided to end our relationship and go our separate ways. We will always look back on our journey with deep fondness, and will continue to support each other both personally and professionally.""
The pair indicated they might continue to record songs together. ""We look forward to sharing more updates with you all as we navigate our future making music together. Thank you all for your love, support and privacy,"" they said.
Bri and Chris got together on night one of the Bachelor spinoff, which aired in April 2020. The musicians went on to release an album together, called Chris and Bri, which included five songs they wrote and five romantic covers.
The first song they co-wrote was ""I Do."" The couple previously explained, ""The lyrics balance the line of the intimacy of our relationship with its public nature. You can find this clearly in the lyrics, 'Fell in love on a TV screen, they don't know you like I do, I do.' Love boils down to the two people who are fighting to make the relationship work.""
In December, the duo dropped another album for Christmas, titled Wrapped Under the Tree.
Bri wrote on Instagram at the time, ""It's been hard. We are so proud of everything we've accomplished this year despite the circumstances and feel SO lucky we were able to do everything we've done. I hope you enjoy and that it makes your holiday a little brighter.""
Chris also wrote, ""In a year where everything has fallen apart, @bristauss and I have been so blessed to share our music and our story with all of you. We made this project to bring some light this Holiday season.""
And as 2020 came to a close, Bri reflected on her monumental year. She said on Instagram, ""This year has been the best of my entire life,"" thanks to her experience on Listen to Your Heart.
However, it appears the couple spent New Year's apart, as Chris shared beach pics of his family on social media and wrote, ""Happy New Year from me and the Watson fam!""
Chris and Bri won the show after judges Rita Wilson, Kaitlyn Bristowe, Jason Tartick, Taye Diggs and Jewel chose them over contestants Jamie Gabrielle and Trevor Holmes, who also split in June 2020.
It's the second Bachelor Nation breakup this week, after Clare Crawley and Dale Moss called it quits two months after their engagement aired.

There might be a little Rachel Green in Alex Russo.
Selena Gomez shared that she was very much influenced by NBC's hit 1994 sitcom Friends while filming her Disney Channel comedy series Wizards of Waverly Place — but she had to be coy about her love for the show.
The Only Murders in the Building star appeared on Wizards of Waverly Pod, a podcast hosted by her former costars Jennifer Stone and David DeLuise, and said that her love of Friends ""triggered certain people"" while on the topic of comedic timing.
""I asked how you had such impeccable timing. You guys were so clever and funny so young,"" DeLuise said. ""And you said to me, 'Don't tell anybody, but I've watched every episode of Friends.' I guess you weren't allowed to watch Friends or something? But I was just going to say, you were very influenced by them, right?""
""1,000 percent,"" Gomez said. ""Now I've had the opportunity to meet some of them, and I freak out to this day."" When Stone asked why she had to remain coy about her love for the sitcom at age 14, Gomez offered: ""I think it was because I wasn't really... actually, I do know why. It triggered certain people. I just had to be annoyingly shy about it.""
Gomez did not further elaborate, but later added that her 9-year-old sister is a fan of the Disney sitcom. ""She's fallen in love with the show. Even before she was born, sometimes I would be by myself, and I would just throw on an episode to fall asleep to. I just loved it,"" she said. ""I think she's got a crush on David [Henrie, who played Gomez's brother].""
A well-documented Friends fan, Gomez has since struck up a friendship with star Jennifer Aniston. The two gave each other flowers when Aniston guest-hosted an episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show in January 2020, where guest Gomez declared that ""Rachel was my life."" She told Aniston, ""I would watch [Friends] on channel 33 at 10:30 every night on Thursday with my mom and I cried when the whole season was over. It's iconic.""

When she outgrew her Disney image and became a pop star and film actor, she left many of the relationships she forged on “Waverly Place” behind. Joining former co-stars Jennifer Stone and David DeLuise on the “Wizards of Waverly Pod” podcast, Gomez admitted that one of her biggest mistakes in life was losing touch with her Disney family. Stone and DeLuise played Gomez’s best friend and father on the Disney hit, respectively.
Gomez is referring to her mental health struggles, which were exacerbated in her post-Disney years given the heightened and extreme media attention surrounding her personal life. The actor said that when she started her run on “Wizards of Waverly Place” she never expected to find a second family, as her parents divorced when she was 5 years old.
Gomez will make more appearances on the “Wizards of Waverly Pod” podcast in the future. New episodes of the series drop on Mondays.

0.4285714285714285,"Frances McDormand's unique acceptance speech at the 2021 Academy Awards on Sunday had a very special meaning behind it.
The actress, 63, accepted the Best Picture Oscar for her film Nomadland when she surprised everyone by letting out a realistic wolf howl onstage as the audience applauded.
""We give this one to our wolf,"" McDormand said as she performed the gesture.
Speaking to reporters backstage after the show, director Chloé Zhao — who won the Best Director Oscar earlier in the night — clarified that McDormand's howl was a tribute to Michael Wolf Snyder, a production sound mixer on the film, who died at 35 earlier this year.
""We unfortunately lost him recently, and his name is Wolf, and he's the production sound mixer both on my previous film, The Rider, and Nomadland, so he's part of the family,"" said Zhao. ""So that howling to the moon is for Wolf.""
Zhao continued: ""My happiest moment tonight is when Fran won — I think sometimes people might not know what she had done out there, you know, as a producer, as an actress, and how much, how open and vulnerable she has been, and how much it helped me to make this movie, and help out the nomads to feel comfortable on set and she really is Nomadland. So I'm so happy, so happy, she got that award.""
Snyder's death was confirmed last month in a Facebook message from his father David that was shared by Snyder's aunt, Cathy Snyder. David, a psychiatrist, said in the post that his son died by suicide and had been struggling with depression for years.
David said that that Snyder ""was certainly thrilled"" over the flurry of award nominations Nomadland received prior to his death. ""Unfortunately, we believe he was gone before getting to see the Golden Globe awards,"" he said.
McDormand paid tribute to Snyder in a statement to Variety and The Hollywood Reporter at the time. ""Wolf recorded our heart beats. Our every breath. For me, he is Nomadland,"" McDormand said.
Zhao also honored Snyder, remembering their dynamics together on the sets of Nomadland and 2017's The Rider. ""I will always miss him. He would always be with me on set, after each take, and in the silence of every room tone. See you down the road, my friend.""
Nomadland won the most awards of this year's Oscars with three: one for Best Picture, one for Best Director (Zhao) and one for Best Actress (McDormand). The film was the clear favorite heading into the night, with five nominations.
The movie follows McDormand's Fern, who chooses to live a nomadic lifestyle while traveling through the American West after losing her husband and her life in a mining town that dissolves after the 2008 recession.
Nomadland is now playing in select theaters and streaming on Hulu.

In an unusual turn of events, McDormand’s award for best actress was handed out after “Nomadland” won the award for best picture. During the acceptance speech, McDormand let out an unabashed howl in tribute to “Nomadland” production sound mixer Michael Wolf Snyder, who died in March at 35.
“Nomadland” was released by Searchlight and distributed on Hulu. It’s a cinéma vérité style drama that sees McDormand and actors like David Strathairn interacting with real-life nomads. Chloe Zhao, who first made waves with “The Rider,” directs the film. The picture with its story of Americans moving from place to place, pulled by an independent spirit and a love of the Western landscape, seemed to resonate with voters during the pandemic, coming during a time where travel had been curtailed.

1.0,"Katy Perry felt upset after learning of an allegation that she was raped by Dr. Luke — a claim she has since denied — according to an unsealed deposition from the ongoing legal battle between Luke and Kesha.
In the court documents obtained by PEOPLE and first published by The Blast from her fully unsealed deposition, which took place on July 21, 2017, the “Pendulum” singer, 34, stated that after learning of Kesha’s allegations that the music producer had raped the “Praying” singer, she “felt pressure” to support Kesha.
“I felt pressured, but I also knew both of them and a lot of people did not. So it was easy for them to be disattached and support an idea rather than an actual instance,” she said.
“People were generally very angry at me for not saying anything,” she said.
Perry also denied the allegation that she was raped by Dr. Luke during the deposition. The allegation was made public as part of the music producer’s defamation suit against Kesha. A rep for Perry did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.
In the deposition, Perry expressed frustration at both the fact that Lady Gaga and Kesha had texted each other about the allegation — and that the music producer was trying to use Perry’s testimony to prove his innocence in his ongoing lawsuit.
In newly released court documents pertaining to Kesha and Lady Gaga’s text messages, the two singers both called Perry “mean,” according to Us Weekly.
The producer’s legal team previously accused Kesha of circulating the rumor that he raped Perry.
“The false narrative Kesha created about being raped became widely accepted, damaging Dr. Luke’s reputation irreparably. Compounding this malicious act, in 2016, Kesha told Lady Gaga that Dr. Luke raped Katy Perry, which is outrageous and untrue,” Dr. Luke’s attorneys said in the statement released after Perry’s deposition was partially unsealed in August.
“Katy Perry testified under oath in this case that Dr. Luke never raped her. Regardless, Kesha refused to apologize. Instead, she issued a press release which again irresponsibly suggested that Katy Perry was actually raped by Dr. Luke. It seems that Kesha wanted to perpetuate the falsehood that Dr. Luke raped Katy Perry,” the statement said.
Kesha has previously denied making such claims.
“With regard to Dr. Luke’s claim that Kesha defamed him by falsely stating he also assaulted Katy Perry, Kesha has never claimed to have any independent knowledge of any alleged assault of Katy Perry (which Ms. Perry has denied in a later deposition),” Kesha’s attorneys said in an August statement.
Kesha and Dr. Luke have been embroiled in a bitter legal battle since 2014, when Kesha sued her former mentor, alleging Luke had drugged and raped her and verbally and emotionally abused her for a decade.
Luke has vehemently denied the allegations and countersued Kesha for breach of contract and defamation. A judge dismissed Kesha’s abuse claims in 2016, but the lawsuit rages on.
Kesha dropped her third album, Rainbow, in August 2017, where it peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She is still tied to Luke through her recording contract with his company.

The document was released as part of the producer’s defamation suit against Kesha, who has accused him of raping her.
Dr. Luke’s attorneys have also accused Kesha of circulating an allegation that he raped Perry. In her deposition, Perry adamantly denied the rumor.
“Did Dr. Luke ever rape you?” an attorney asked.
According to the suit, Kesha sent a text message to Lady Gaga in February 2016 in which she claimed that Dr. Luke had raped Perry. A separate deposition of Lady Gaga was also partially released on Monday, in which she discussed hearing the rumor from John Janick, the CEO and chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M Records. Lady Gaga said she was with Kesha at the time, and Janick was showing support for Kesha.
“He said something like, ‘I heard he raped Katy, too,'” Lady Gaga testified.
In her deposition, Perry said she has heard of Janick, but does not know him and never made any sort of sexual allegation to him about Dr. Luke.
“I couldn’t pick him out of a crowd,” Perry testified.
Janick issued his own statement on Monday, following the release of the transcript excerpts.
“As his deposition makes clear, John Janick was simply a bystander to a conversation; not a participant in it. Although John is not a party to this litigation, he voluntarily provided factual responses to questions from both sides’ attorneys,” the statement read.
Almost all of the depositions of the two stars were kept under seal. Dr. Luke’s attorneys are accusing Kesha of cooking up a false rape allegation as part of a concerted campaign to ruin his career and extricate her from her contract.
One of the documents released on Monday was a Sunshine Sachs press plan, dated Oct. 10, 2014, in which the publicity firm discusses preparations for the filing of Kesha’s lawsuit against Dr. Luke.
“Our goal is to help extricate Client K from her current professional relationship with Person L by inciting a deluge of negative media attention and public pressure on the basis of the horrific personal abuses presented in the lawsuit,” the document states.
Early Tuesday, Azoff issued a statement on the matter.
Dr. Luke’s attorneys issued a statement on Monday arguing that the publicity campaign largely succeeded.
Kesha’s attorneys issued their own statement, arguing that Dr. Luke had taken his litigation strategy “straight out of the blame-the-victim playbook.” They said that Kesha never claimed any independent knowledge of whether Dr. Luke in fact raped Katy Perry, and argued that it is frivolous for him to sue her for defamation based on a comment in a private text message.
They also highlighted quotations from depositions of Kesha and her mother, in support of her claim that Dr. Luke did in fact rape Kesha in 2005.

0.25,"Kelly Wynne has been a TV writer at PEOPLE digital since 2021. Her work has been seen in Newsweek, where she acted as a reality TV and true-crime writer, Atwood Magazine and her mental health blog, The Chronically.
Christine Brown will remain a staple on Sister Wives — even though she was the first of a three-woman exodus that has left the show's patriarch Kody Brown with only one wife.
""I am definitely not leaving Sister Wives,"" Christine said Wednesday on TikTok. She later repeated, ""I'm still doing Sister Wives. No worries, everybody.""
In the video, Christine also revealed the all-new confessional set that was installed in her Utah basement. ""This is the set in my home!"" she said. ""I'm so excited. You're gonna love it."" Christine showed the new decor, including white bookshelves stacked with books, glass bottles and hats on mannequin heads.
""It's like my favorite room in the house,"" Christine said, acknowledging the set is the only thing in her still-unfinished basement.
The TikTok comes shortly after Christine uploaded her last day on set at the Flagstaff home — which had been her Sister Wives homebase for years. ""This is the couch, right here, that I've sat on for years talking about the show and discussing my feelings,"" she said, adding, ""This is the last time and it's a little bittersweet.""
There was an emphasis on ""sweet,"" with Christine knowing she'd no longer have to drive eight hours twice a month to film in her old neighborhood. Now, the Sister Wives plot will follow Christine on her own terms — in her own state — as she navigates her single life.
Christine ended her marriage to Kody Brown in November 2021. More recently, Janelle Brown also announced her separation from Kody, and Meri Brown confirmed that Kody ended their marriage, too. That means, Sister Wives will continue with just one wife — Robyn Brown.

The exes—whose split was announced in Nov. 2021—spoke out on the Dec. 18 special Sister Wives: One on One, during which Christine addressed Kody's previous comments about not being attracted to her.
""To hear that he wasn't attracted to me, it was terrible to hear,"" Christine told host Sukanya Krishnan. ""And it's super embarrassing right? Ugh. I just got to thinking, 'You know what? It really just goes both ways.'""
Christine said it was in that moment that she fully knew their marriage was over. ""After he said that, I was kind of like, 'Oh, well then I'm done. Then it's over,'"" she continued. ""It was almost a relief. 'Well then I'm not going to keep fighting for this, and I'm not going to keep trying and I'm not going to keep doing this if you're not attracted to me. So everything that I've done for you, for the family means nothing.'""
During the season 17 premiere of Sister Wives, which aired in September 2022, Kody said he was ""turned off"" by Christine's ""behavior""—seemingly referencing where she stood with his fellow wives Meri, Janelle and Robyn Brown—and that he was not attracted to her when they tied the knot in 1994.
As for Kody's remark about her ""behavior,"" Christine noted during the One on One special that the comment made her mad.
""I'm not a child. I'm your wife. You don't talk to me like that,"" she said. ""My bad behavior? That's just insulting. Please. I'm an adult. That's just rude and belittling. No, how dare you. I was furious when he said bad behavior.""
When they ultimately agreed to go their separate ways, Christine said she remembered thinking, ""Finally. Gosh. Huge weight. Finally, the end of the conversation I was like, 'Good because it's over. Come on. Stop fighting for something that your ego's attached to.'""
During the special, Kody—who shares six of his 18 children with Christine—claimed that she had already ""completely decided"" that their marriage was over by the time they'd had their conversation in the season 17 premiere. He also accused her of being a ""game player.""
Kody and Christine aren't the only ones who split. During the special, Janelle confirmed she and Kody are separated and Kody said he doesn't consider himself married to Meri (he and Meri divorced in 2014 so he could wed Robyn—the only wife in his plural marriage that he's legally married to—but they'd remained in a relationship).

0.2352941176470588,"""I honestly didn't dare to dream.""
Sometimes, characters can take twists and turns even the actors portraying them don't anticipate, as Rhea Seehorn, who plays Kim Wexler on Better Call Saul, found out. Seehorn fully expected her character, Kim Wexler, to be killed off at some point in the series, but things turned out quite differently.
In an interview with Empire magazine, Seehorn revealed that she had no idea if her character would make it to the end of the series run, and she fully expected to, as said in the movie The Godfather, sleep with the fishes. ""At some point, I started having storylines that weren't just ancillary to Jimmy [McGill], and I was thrilled, but I honestly didn't dare to dream."" Seehorn continued by saying she flipped through scripts with her costar, Patrick Fabian, and Seehorn would be surprised to see her character wasn't dead. It was a relief, because she remarked, ""It just became a thing of, 'I don't want to get out of this sandbox.' It's the best writing, the best character, and the best people.""
To be completely fair, Seehorn's expectations for Kim Wexler's death were founded. As Better Call Saul is a prequel series to Breaking Bad, certain characters' fates in Better Call Saul were already revealed and known in Breaking Bad. Kim Wexler's character was created specifically for Better Call Saul and did not have a presence in Breaking Bad, as such expecting Kim to die was a reasonable thought process. Bob Odenkirk, who plays the titular character, also guessed incorrectly about his character's fate, initially believing he would go out in a blaze of glory. After being sworn in, Saul confesses everything he did on Breaking Bad. He also offers another confession, admitting he was responsible for sabotaging his brother's career. Saul eventually ends up in prison, and is at peace with the decisions he made.

Both Odenkirk and Seehorn both guessed wrong about their character's fates. We wonder if fans of the show also thought Saul would get away with everything or if Kim would end up dead. Either way, it's a surprise, and all the revelations are a fitting way to wrap up the series. But even though Better Call Saul is now over, don't fret. You'll soon be able to see Seehorn in new series from Vince Gilligan (creator of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul), and Odenkirk is set to appear in the upcoming series Straight Man on AMC.

No one messes with Uncle Junior!","For six seasons, fans of Better Call Saul have worried about Kim Wexler. The ultracompetent attorney who married Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), the man most likely to bring out the shadier side of her character, never appears in Breaking Bad, which led some viewers to assume she would die before Saul finished its run.
But as Monday’s series finale confirmed, Kim Wexler lives on. In the last two episodes, she confesses to her role in torpedoing the reputation of Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian) and inadvertently leading him to the moment of his death. She confronts her own emotions about everything she’s been through during a wrenching breakdown on an airport shuttle. She also reconciles with Jimmy, who finally ends up in jail after owning up in a courtroom to his many mistakes. Kim Wexler’s been through it. But she’s probably going to be okay.
Vulture’s weekly newsletter of the best TV and movie recommendations.
The fact that so many people were so invested in the wellbeing of this woman, a character who didn’t fully take shape in the minds of Better Call Saul co-creators Peter Gould and Vince Gilligan until they saw Seehorn play her, is a testament to Seehorn’s skills as an actor. So is the Emmy Award nomination she finally — finally! — received last month for her work in the first half of season six.
One of the things that makes Seehorn so formidable onscreen is a quality she shares with Kim: She always comes prepared. But even someone who does their homework can’t always anticipate every curve ball. Better Call Saul threw a few in its final season, including Odenkirk’s sudden heart attack last year, which temporarily altered the production schedule, and some particularly challenging scenes in the final two episodes.
In the finale, Jimmy finally has to deal with some consequences, and the people who ultimately hold him to account are Kim, with the affidavit; Carol Burnett’s character, who calls the cops; and then the judge in his case, who is also a woman. Did you take note of that?I didn’t think about that. Kim does something when he calls her at the sprinkler place that she has done all along: I think it is out of love to say, “Turn yourself in” and “You can’t be living much of a life.” Kim has no idea that he’s a manager at Cinnabon, but he’s living a life in hiding from the Feds and possibly from cartel people, which is even more of a shell of a life than what she’s living.
In her confession, Kim continues to say one lie. She does not say that she knows Saul Goodman is alive. She stays clear of making his life worse. There are people that are going to see it as, “Well, he was forced into this because she went and confessed everything they did,” but as she says, she’s not really sure they can legally prosecute anything that Kim and Jimmy did. Not the stuff she confessed to. They could come after her for tampering with evidence maybe, but it’s going to be a flimsy case. I do think that she goes and admits all this stuff perfectly willing to be prosecuted and she knows that his widow could bring a civil suit against her. But she has no direct knowledge of exactly what Jimmy has done during the Breaking Bad years.
She knows he was aiding and abetting because she would read the paper. She would have to know what Walter White has done, or Gus Fring. She doesn’t have any specifics to incriminate him with and she never threatens to turn him in. She comes back to the court because ADA Suzanne Ericsen says he is going to incriminate her for things she didn’t do, which is infuriating. The way I started that trial scene was fury, the ultimate betrayal, because for her, there is still love and that’s why she refused to turn him in. The fact that he would be fine with her going to jail is deeply disturbing to her. But then of course, throughout the course of the trial, she finds out that’s not true.
I wasn’t sure if the affidavit would bring law-enforcement attention back to him. I wondered if somewhere in her mind she was like, I don’t want to get Jimmy into more trouble, but I also want him to be caught because I don’t want him to be living like this.I had not thought of that but I’m sure it’s among the infinite interpretations that Peter wants there to be. He wanted to write a finale and end the series in a way that might answer one question but it’s going to raise two more.
I chose to play that her turning herself in was her saving herself and her advice to him to turn himself in was an attempt to save him, but I didn’t think of it as, “I will now bring some more attention back to the case by bringing his name up again publicly.” I guess part of me was thinking, considering what they’re trying to charge him with, him being responsible for sullying someone’s reputation by calling them a drug addict was the least of his worries.
I want to discuss that courtroom scene, but before I do, I’d be remiss if I didn’t ask you about the scene on the airport shuttle in “Waterworks” where Kim loses it. You only did two takes of it, is that right?Yes. With two cameras in the tram. We might have even shoved three in there because he was trying to get as many angles as you can in as few takes. I didn’t know we’d only do two takes until I arrived. I prepared as best I could to have to do many, many, many, many takes. That is not because any of our directors are sadistic, but it’s because the visual vocabulary of the show is many angles on the same thing. So, just technically, that requires you doing it over and over and over and over.
So I was prepared. For me, that means not just hoping I can go over to a corner and drum up some painful memory of my real life. I’m all for anybody’s style of working, I just know that I can’t do that for 36 takes. So what I wanted to do was think about the different pieces that she’s crying about here, because it is not just about one moment. She’s crying for the entire Shakespearean tragedy of Jimmy McGill and of Kim Wexler and of their relationship and of Chuck and of Howard and of people that try to be a good person and how hard that fight could be in day-to-day real life.
Then there’s the actual 24 hours that she’s had since getting Jimmy’s call. I think she still loves him. I think she’s terrified for him and flew to New Mexico and lied to God knows how many people about where she was going. Didn’t pack a bag. Didn’t get any sleep. And then, there’s a progression of scenes. Being a stranger in a strange land at a courthouse that used to be her home. Looking at everything that she could have had and then letting Hamlin’s widow nail her to the stake and accepting it. We were insistent — Vince and I in conversations and then also with Peter — that Kim cannot look for sympathy in those scenes. It is not fair for her to be the one that has to be consoled in any way, which is why I’m so stoic in those scenes.
I tried to take in all of those things, then build it. I do a thing where I ask myself, “Well, where does that kind of pain live? Where does that kind of shame live? Is it the feeling of throwing up? Is it when you feel like it’s tight under your sternum? Is it when your chest gets real heavy?” We all know that feeling where you’re not sure you can breathe.
Is that a scene you can even rehearse beforehand?Rehearse in a traditional way? No. That’s more script analysis. Super-technical stuff like, “Let’s go through everything that happened to her today so that I understand exactly what I’ve been doing for the last 24 hours. Let’s go through what went down 24 hours before that. Did I lie? Do I feel bad about that? What did I say?” Because I didn’t know if we’d shoot out of sequence, so it was important for me to imagine how it would feel walking into the courthouse and confessing those things. Is there relief? Is it just shame?
Someone asked me the other day in an interview, “Do you think Kim, over the last five, six years, has been privately crying in a closet like this away from people?” I said, “No.” The decision I made is that this is the first time she’s let any of this out. She would not let herself feel it. One, for fear that the dam would never be able to be closed up again and two, because of the compartmentalizing. You can’t rehearse it in a traditional way, but I did a lot of thinking about it and then gave myself some tactile markers that I knew that I could have as a reminder of my starting point each time when I get on the bus.
She feels no actual passion about the people she knows in Florida. They’re lovely. They’re nice. They’re great, but they don’t actually even know her real life. There’s one person that knows the real Kim and he is on the lam from the Feds and it was the love of her life and that’s done — I’m blathering on and on. Is any of this interesting? I’m so sorry.
My God, don’t apologize. I always love talking to you because you explain your process so clearly.I love that. Thank you.
Also, I gripped my purse — it was on my lap and I remember telling myself, “Let it remind you of how sick to your stomach you are with what you’ve done to people,” which immediately made me start swallowing and feel, like, indigestion. I attached different physical things to different memories of Jimmy and Kim, or of the tragedy of Jimmy and his brother. And the fact that he used to be a little kid who had all this potential and he’s a brilliant lawyer. It made my heart ache, and saying goodbye to him in the breakup scene automatically makes me have a lump in my throat.
I think that’s all the prep you can do. After that, you rely on the gift that I’ve had of seven years, six seasons of some of the smartest people in the whole business telling me that when I do my homework of creating Kim and I think the thoughts, that it’s enough. That scene is terrifying on paper. I have the great fortune of the support system that I have that made me feel I’m going to be enough when I get there.
Her final look to him, Peter and I talked about it and Bob and I talked about that there’s great compassion, fear, love, worry for him in that moment when he exits the courtroom. But it needed to not be the same thing that you see when I go and have the cigarette with him. We knew we needed to hold something back for that.
Bob brought something wonderful to that [cigarette] scene. The joy of these scripts and getting a scene partner like Bob is you do all your work but then you get there knowing that you’re now going to be affected by how he chose to play his side. The way he was doing Jimmy that day, he was so worried about Kim being too scared for him and wanting to let her know that he’s going to be okay. I just thought it was such a beautiful act of love.
Was that the last scene you shot? The last scene we shot was the smoking.
I don’t mean to sound like I’m not organic in the moment. It’s just how I work, that I do a lot of homework so that I am free to let it all go when I get there and then be organic and respond to whatever. So I just tried to go about thinking like, “Okay, saying goodbye to somebody is a very real thing that one can use, but even more so the idea that she can’t let it go right now. It would be inappropriate for Rhea to bawl through this scene, but it would also be inappropriate for Kim to bawl through this scene.” I stayed very close to the set between takes and I didn’t go and chat with people. I often goof around even on difficult scenes and just go in and out. But we had press there, and in-house people doing DVD commentary stuff on the last day, and people crying over in the corner saying goodbye to each other, and I needed to stay away from it all.
It’s been extraordinary, just the most beautiful way to become a better actor. Everything that I’ve gotten to learn from doing this character, from doing this writing, being challenged by these scripts and also this direction, and also Bob as my scene partner. He is tireless in his pursuit of truth in a scene, as am I, or at least I try to be.
Obviously you had the unfortunate situation of Bob’s heart attack while you were filming these final episodes. How did that affect how you felt going through the remainder of the show?I’m sure physiologically and neurologically there’s no way that it’s not a part of the matrix that’s in my brain when I’m performing with Bob. Almost everyone has lost someone that they are very, very close to and been like, “If I could have just had one more day, if I could have just said one more thing.” And you never get it. And I got it. And so did Patrick Fabian and Bob’s beloved family that I adore and the whole world, apparently. We found out how much the whole entire world loves Bob Odenkirk. No surprise, but now it’s in writing.
It was really hard when we had to return to the scene that [the heart attack] happened in. Thankfully, we had shot our close coverage. We were turning around on Tony Dalton when it happened. So it probably was weirder for Tony. Bob and I had to watch [the scene again] because he doesn’t remember the entire day. Fourteen hours of shooting: nothing.
It was also very hard the first time he got back on his exercise bike. The entire crew went silent.
Oh, gosh.He was getting off it when it happened. Just so everyone knows, and Bob’s insistent about this, the exercise bike did not cause the heart attack. It’s plaque that just moves one day. It’s actually the fact that he’s constantly staying in the best shape of his life because of doing Nobody, that’s why he survived so well.
The scene where you share the cigarette and then Kim leaves the prison: In your mind, was that the only visit? Do you think she will come back and visit him again? Now this is very purposely written to be open to interpretation, and there will be multiple interpretations. I asked Peter’s permission. I said, “Do you want me to not answer people what my thoughts were?” He said, “You can say whatever you want to.” Mine is fully infused not with Kim’s thoughts, but with Rhea’s thoughts, and I am a hopeless romantic. I think definitely that’s not the last visit. They are going to see each other many times. I actually think that she goes about trying to reduce his sentence in a legally just way, not cutting corners. What their relationship is after that, I’m not sure of, but I think they stay in each other’s lives. I do.
Do you feel like there’s more of Kim’s story to tell?Sure. I have the benefit of playing an extremely inscrutable character, so we have tons of secrets we could find out about her. Who knows? I know [Vince and Peter] both have said that they want to step away from that world, at least for the moment and probably for a while. So if they decide to revisit it, I hope I’m not too old. If they want to revisit it, I would revisit it in a heartbeat.
Is Kim happy in Florida? I think she might be content but not happy.Agreed. I think her starting to volunteer at the legal office, the pro bono office, and her visiting Jimmy are signs that she is just beginning to think that she deserves to live a more authentic life and hopefully find passion and real value.
It was important to us to not have her return to the jail cell with blonde hair, or even with brown hair in a ponytail. It is not supposed to look like it’s just a reset. It’s a very, very long road ahead, but I do think that she went back and confessed because she decided, yes, it’s atoning for your sins more than just living this shell of a life. But I also think it was a decision to breathe again.
In the scene where I’m walking away from the prison and he does finger guns, we actually filmed me doing them back to him.
Before we finish, I do want to say congratulations on your Emmy nomination. That is long overdue.Thank you.
Have you given any thought to anything about that night yet? Or does it still feel too far away?I’m probably supposed to be thinking about it more than I am. It sounds dumb, but I’m really enjoying being nominated.
Why is that dumb?Well, I think people always say that so that you think they don’t care about winning, but I honestly just am enjoying that part. The only part that terrifies me — I’m not terrified of losing, but I’m terrified of public speaking. So if I do go up on stage, you’ll see me in real fear, which is why my acceptance speech for the HCAs, I’m shaking through the whole thing. But for me, it was pretty good. It was intelligible at least.
That is so interesting that you don’t like public speaking. I guess it’s different when it’s your words as you versus you reading somebody else’s words as a character.It is different. I had to do some acceptance speech — listen to me, I had to. I had to because I won an award. What a pain in the ass. I should say I got to do a speech. This was quite a few years ago when I was even worse. And they said, “Well, just pretend it is a character that you’re playing and then play that, so then it’s not you.” Then it just came out super-fake, super over-rehearsed because it’s like, “I’m playing a me that’s accepting an award.” It was so stupid.
It’s the same reason I used to be horrible at curtain calls, really bowing in a weird way and just making the dumbest smiles. Howard Shalwitz, one of my greatest mentors in theater, the artistic director and creator of the Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company in D.C. — it’s still one of my greatest achievements that I’m a company member there — he came up to me and was like, “Rhea, I need to talk to you about the curtain calls.” And this is embarrassing, but I thought in my head, I know, because I’m so humble. I was like, “In those moments, having the focus on me, it’s just hard for me, because I don’t want it to be about me.” And he’s like, “That’s great. But listen, the curtain call is actually not for you. The curtain call is for the audience to be given a moment to appreciate the performance and tell you what they thought of it, and you should accept it with graciousness because it is for them. It is not a moment about you.” He wasn’t being mean at all, but I never forgot that. And I did my curtain calls like a normal human after that.

“It was devastating news for me,” the pro told PEOPLE exclusively on Monday. However, Murgatroyd did reveal that despite having to find partner Andy Grammer a new pro, she plans to be in the rehearsal room as much as possible to support the singer.

0.238095238095238,"The veteran TV actress was hospitalized last week after she fell into a coma brought on by meningitis.
Jessica is a staff writer at Entertainment Weekly, where she covers TV, movies, and pop culture. Her work has appeared in Bustle, NYLON, Cosmopolitan, InStyle, and more. She lives in California with her dog.
Veteran TV actress Denise Dowse, best known for her roles in Beverly Hills, 90210 and Insecure, among others, has died after a battle with meningitis. She was 64.
Dowse's sister Tracey shared the news in an Instagram post on Saturday. ""I want to take this moment to thank our friends and family for all of the love and prayers,"" she wrote. ""It is with a very heavy heart that I inform everyone that my sister, Denise Dowse has gone forward to meet our family in eternal life.""
She called Dowse ""the most amazing sister, a consummate, illustrious actress, mentor and director,"" adding, ""She was my very best friend and final family member. Denise loved all of you. I know that she is watching over us with all the love she has.""
More information about Dowse's celebration of life service will be shared at a later time, noted Tracey. ""Again I am so grateful for all the calls, text messages, direct messages, and silent prayers for my sister,"" she wrote. ""We could not have made it so gracefully and painlessly without all of the prayer warriors around the world.""
Tracey announced last week that her sister was hospitalized after she fell into a coma brought on by a virulent form of meningitis, a disease caused by the inflammation of brain and spinal cord membranes. ""She is a vibrant actor and director that should have many years ahead of her,"" Tracey wrote at the time. ""Thoughts, prayers and support are greatly appreciated.""
Denise's representatives did not immediately respond to EW's request for comment.
A fixture on '90s TV, Dowse portrayed West Beverly Hills High Vice Principal Yvonne Teasley on Beverly Hills, 90210, and made appearances on Seinfeld, California Dreams, Full House, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, ER, and Moesha, among others. Her dozens of other credits include Charmed, Secrets and Lies, Good Trouble, Stumptown, and, most recently, Insecure, as Molly's (Yvonne Orji) therapist Rhonda Pine.
On the film front, Dowse had roles in the Ray Charles biopic Ray opposite Jamie Foxx, Darren Aronofsky's psychological thriller Requiem for a Dream, and Dr. Dolittle opposite Eddie Murphy. She was also set to make her film directorial debut with Remember Me: The Mahalia Jackson Story, which follows the life and career of the gospel singer and activist who played an integral role in the civil rights movement.
On Sunday, Orji remembered her onscreen therapist as a ""delight and a pleasure to work with."" She wrote on Twitter, ""She embodied the strength and wisdom in real life that her character #DrRhonda shared with Molly. You will truly be missed and so fondly remembered.""
Ian Ziering, who starred opposite Dowse on 90210 as Steve Sanders, called the loss heartbreaking. ""Throughout all my years working on Beverly Hills 90210, my scenes with Denise will always be remembered with the utmost in respect for her talent, and fondness for the loving soul she was,"" Ziering wrote on Instagram. ""Some of my heartiest off camera laughs were between she and I hammering out the the discipline her Mrs. Teasley would dish out to my Steve Sanders.""","Actor Luke Perry, known for roles in “Beverly Hills 90210” and “Riverdale,” died on Monday after suffering a massive stroke on Wednesday. He was 52.
However, in 1990 Perry became a household name for playing the brooding loner Dylan McKay on the smash hit teen drama “Beverly Hills, 90210” on Fox. The show became a phenomenon, catapulting Perry to full-blown teen idol status. He appeared on a racy Vanity Fair cover in July 1992.
Perry had two runs on “90210,” one from 1990 to 1995 and another from 1998 to the show’s end in 2000, during which time his character struggled with alcohol abuse and drug addiction, and went through a series of tumultuous relationships with several other main characters including Brenda (played by Shannen Doherty) and Kelly (played by Jennie Garth).
Coincidentally, Perry was hospitalized the same day Fox announced a six-episode revival of the show, featuring returning cast members Jason Priestley, Jennie Garth, Ian Ziering, Gabrielle Carteris, Brian Austin Green, and Tori Spelling. Perry had not been announced to return.
“Luke will always be part of the Fox family. Our thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones during this extremely difficult time. He will be deeply missed,” said Fox Entertainment in a statement.
More recently, Perry made a successful return to the TV drama genre with a regular role on the CW show “Riverdale.” He played Fred Andrews, the conservative, old-fashioned yet soft father of the show’s lead Archie Andrews (KJ Apa).
The show’s writers were among those who took to social media to pay tribute to Perry.
“Luke Perry…you were a joyful and vibrant soul. You will be missed but most certainly your legacy will be remembered forever. Rest in love and peace, friend,” a post from the writers’ room read.
“We are saddened to hear of the passing of Luke Perry. Luke left an impression on viewers around the world through his work on ‘Riverdale,’ and this is a very sad day both for his fans, and for our staff who worked closely with him. Our hearts go out to his family and friends,” the statement read.

Stand-up comedian John Mulaney will once again be returning to host Saturday Night Live making him officially part of the Five-Timers Club. The Five-Timers Club joke was brought up not too long ago when, in late December, Paul Rudd was welcomed into the club by Tom Hanks and Tina Fey. Unfortunately, Rudd’s episode aired without an audience present, due to the surge of cases of those infected with the new Omicron variant. So far, the club consists of 21 stars who have hosted the show a minimum of five times. Now, it seems it is time for the former SNL writer to join the club and become its 22nd member.
Mulaney is scheduled to host the late-night show on February 26, with LCD Soundsystem as the musical guest for the episode. The rock band last played on the show in 2017. Mulaney’s first appearance as SNL’s host was on April 24, followed by March 2, 2019, and two times in 2020, February 29 and October 31. He will be joining the Five-Timers Club which includes, besides the aforementioned Hanks and Fey, stars like Scarlett Johansson, Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin, and Drew Barrymore.
In 2021, a year in which he did not host SNL, Mulaney had a spotlight shone on his personal life with the announcement of his divorce from makeup artist Annamarie Tendler, in May. The same month, not long after, it was revealed that Mulaney had begun a relationship with actress Olivia Munn. In September, the couple revealed they were expecting a child and two months later in November, their son, Malcolm, was born.
On Twitter, Mulaney confirmed his future appearance by posting a picture that featured three vertically lined up multicolored pamphlets, one that read the episode’s premiere date, another his name, and the bottom one ‘LCD Soundsystem’. The caption read: “And just like that…”. The honor of hosting the show has only ever been attributed to three other former SNL writers besides Mulaney, Conan O'Brien, Louis C.K., and Larry David.
You can witness the comedian being welcomed into the renowned Five-Timers Club next month, on Saturday, February 26.

On Saturday, it was announced that the 39-year-old comedian will return to his Saturday Night Live roots as host of the late-night comedy sketch series on Feb. 26.
The upcoming hosting gig will mark Mulaney's fifth time hosting SNL, which will make him an official member of the series' prestigious Five-Timers Club.

Mulaney previously served as a writer on SNL for four years from 2008-12. During that time, he would occasionally appear on the show's Weekend Update segment, and he also helped co-create Bill Hader's beloved Stefon character.
The comedian is also the fourth SNL writer to host the show, despite never appearing as an official cast member. Others who have that distinction include Conan O'Brien, Louis C.K., and Larry David.
Mulaney first hosted SNL in April 2018, and then hosted again almost a year later in March 2019. Right before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the series, the comedian hosted in February 2020 and then once more in October of that same year.
LCD Soundsystem, meanwhile, last appeared as a musical guest on SNL back in 2017 during an episode hosted by Chris Pine.
Mulaney's hosting gig will mark his first since he became a father back in November. A source told PEOPLE that Mulaney and Olivia Munn welcomed their first child together a month after Mulaney shared the news of their pregnancy on Late Night with Seth Meyers.
""My Golden Ox baby. Malcolm Hiệp Mulaney. Happy Holidays,"" Munn, 41, later wrote, sharing the baby boy's first photo. Mulaney captioned his own post: ""Meet Malcolm Hiệp Mulaney. He has his whole life ahead of him. He hasn't even tried seltzer yet. I'm very in love with him and his whole deal. Happy Holidays.""
Recently, SNL's Pete Davidson got to meet the pair's newborn son, which Mulaney documented on his Instagram Story. ""Uncle Pete!"" he wrote for the post set to the ""F.U.N. Song"" from SpongeBob SquarePants.

0.3076923076923076,"Emma D'Arcy has proven themselves as an amazing addition to the franchise!
It is indisputable that despite appearing in only 5 episodes of House of the Dragon, Milly Alcock's portrayal of Rhaenyra left a deep impression on viewers. For some viewers, the character recasting came as such a shock because it happened so quickly, yet it was necessary for the plot.
Like Alcock, the non-binary performer Emma D'Arcy has somehow cemented themselves distinctly in fans' hearts as the adult version of Princess Rhaenyra in only 4 episodes. Nevertheless, viewers soon understand why the decision was crucial since Emma was a better candidate to depict Rhaenyra's maturity as a future queen as she grew older.
The first time viewers see D’Arcy as Rhaenyra following Alcock's departure is when the Princess gives birth to her third child with Ser Laenor (John Macmillan). In addition, the Princess was requested by the Queen (Olivia Cooke) to bring the baby to her after the birth rather than rest, thus she did so by walking through a crowded corridor while bleeding.
This episode's most agonizing yet remarkable scene serves as a fast demonstration of D'Arcy's talent. From birth until the walk, the entire sequence was a single take, however, D'Arcy never wavered or broke character while still convincingly portraying Rhaenyra's misery and proving to be a tough opponent in the game.
After the violent children’s fight which resulted in the young Aemond (Leo Ashton) losing an eye, Queen Alicent insisted constantly that Lucerys (Harvey Sadler) pay for her son’s eye. Rhaenyra, however, changed the course of events by charging Aemond with treason for disseminating false information on the parentage of her sons. Alicent lost control and decided to handle the situation herself due to King Viserys' (Paddy Considine) unwavering support and affection for his daughter.
RELATED:What Was on the Paper Alicent Sent Rhaenyra in the 'House of the Dragon' Finale?
Their strained relationship reached its breaking point when Rhaenyra confronted Alicent. Their facial expressions are quite varied, conveying not only the confidence Rhaenyra has to project but also the tenderness she displayed for her sons—a potent mix befitting a courageous leader.
The confrontation with Alicent resulted in Rhaenyra's arm being cut, and she had to have stitched. That is when Ser Laenor, her lawful husband, arrived after a night of heavy drinking and relentless self-blame for failing to defend his sister. Laenor then admitted that he had failed Rhaenyra in his roles as a husband and a father as well, but promised to put things right this time.
D'Arcy conveyed how tolerant, compassionate, and reasonable Rhaenyra was toward her husband and his genuine nature simply by the expression on their face. It was one of the few times the adult Princess actually smiled, and it also happened right before when she made the crucial decision regarding her family’s welfare in a mature manner.
After King Viserys and Queen Alicent left Driftmark, Princess spent some time discussing her plans and future with her uncle, Daemon (Matt Smith). Rhaenyra was straightforward with what she wanted and how Daemon would help her to achieve that.
Rhaenyra and Daemon came back to King's Landing 6 years after their secret traditional Valyrian wedding to support Lucerys' (Elliot Grihault) inheritance when it was questioned by Ser Vaemond Velaryon (Wil Johnson). The Hightowers were about to land their first strike at the court which left the Princess alone without any allies, she came and begged her father, King Viserys’ for assistance.
It was a short emotional and vulnerable encounter between an ill father and his daughter who was carrying a great burden of duty he left her. Despite its briefness, D'Arcy nonetheless managed to convey to the viewers Rhaenyra’s current state of fragility and hopelessness. Not only was the responsibility of an heir and future monarch captured, but also the concern and anguish of a mother.
After a very heated and turbulent political conflict, the Targaryens were able to put their differences aside for one final meal with their ailing patriarch. During dinner, after Viserys used his last remaining strength to bring his fractured family back together, Rhaenyra raised a toast to the Queen and complimented her for being an honorable and devoted wife. She was also the one who apologized initially and reached a ceasefire between the two sides for her father’s sake.
RELATED:What Might 'House of the Dragon' Season 2 Look Like Based on 'Fire & Blood'?
Up until this moment, D’Arcy's character hasn't had a lot of physical activity, thus their skills have only been displayed through the Princess’s excellent facial expressions. This time, humility, wisdom, and gratitude prevailed.
In the final episode of season 1, the history of the violent birth scenes on this show eventually caught up with Rhaenyra and her stillborn child. After learning of her father's dying and the Greens' usurping of the throne, Rhaenyra entered an early labor that was agonizing to watch.
It was in this scene that D'Arcy's physical performance really stood out because it not only captured the intense anguish of a laboring woman but also that of a woman whose birthright had been taken from her and who felt completely betrayed. The audience can see Rhaenyra’s eagerness to push her babe out without saying anything since she didn't want her motherhood and gender to prevent her from becoming a proper ruler while the men in her life had previously acted without her order.
The now Queen Rhaenyra attended her war council while surrounded by men who are eager to start a war with the Greens. The Queen preserved her composure, followed her father’s wish to defend the realm, not tear it apart, and cautiously and firmly calculated before making any decisions despite continually being urged to act differently.
D'Arcy did a wonderful job of capturing Rhaenyra’s intellect, serenity, and confidence in her own strength, especially during such severe and post-traumatic situations. The men in this room were now debating whether it was improper to place the faith of the realm in the hands of a woman, yet, Rhaenyra was adamant about her choice.
After the meeting with Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), Rhaenyra continued to be cautious and stated that everything burned when dragons flew to war, according to her father. After clearing the chamber, she reminds Daemon that her responsibility to defend the Seven Kingdoms because of the Song of Ice and Fire goes beyond just self-interest. Since he didn’t comprehend, he grabbed her by her neck and claimed Viserys was a slave of his prophecies.
Despite the fear in her eyes, D'Arcy also effectively captures Rhaenyra’s calmness as he let her go. Rhaenyra didn’t inquire as to why because she instantly figured it out with a little smirk, courtesy of D’Arcy’s fine acting that she had always been the chosen one, not him.
After the unfortunate and traumatic event at Storm's End, Daemon notified Rhaenyra about Lucerys' passing with the camera following their backs. D'Arcy's representation of Rhaenyra’s physical suffering was devastating as her entire body progressively disintegrated, even though it was only for a few brief seconds.
The character's and the series' trajectory entirely changed with the final face turning toward and direct gaze at the camera at the end. The cool-headed and logical Queen was gone, and in her place came a mother's wrath that D'Arcy masterfully captured.

Warning: This article contains spoilers from House of the Dragon episode 5.
This Sunday, actor Emma D'Arcy (Wanderlust, Truth Seekers) will be taking over the role of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen on HBO's House of the Dragon after Milly Alcock portrayed the character for the first five episodes of season 1. Ahead of that switcheroo, the network released a clip of D'Arcy's very first scene.
Another time jump after episode 5 will take us to episode 6, where Rhaenyra has given birth to a son with husband Laenor Velaryon, now played as an adult by actor John Macmillan following Theo Nate's turn in the role. The clip shows Rhaenyra, struggling to recuperate from the physical trials of childbirth, forcing herself to walk through the castle at King's Landing because ""she"" wants to see her newborn.
She can only mean Queen Alicent Hightower, who will now be portrayed by Olivia Cooke after Emily Carey played the younger version of Alicent in the first half of the season.
The clip was released on Tuesday as part of a series of reveals for current and upcoming HBO projects to celebrate the network's 50 years of operations. The scene further highlights the strife between Rhaenyra and Alicent, a relationship that fuels the Dance of the Dragons, the civil war at the center of House of the Dragon.
""Let me take him,"" Laenor offers to Rhaenyra as she carries the babe.
""No. She'll get no such satisfaction from that,"" his wife replies.
House of the Dragon centers on Princess Rhaenyra, who was named heir to the Iron Throne by her father, King Viserys I Targaryen (Paddy Considine). But the realm becomes torn over succession when Rhaenyra's childhood best friend Alicent becomes the king's second wife and gives birth to a male heir, Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney), leading to one of the bloodiest civil wars in the history of Westeros.
Under showrunners Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik, the first five episodes sought to illustrate the relationship between Rhaenyra and Alicent as young girls and the patriarchal system that pit them against each other.
House of the Dragon airs every Sunday on HBO and streams on HBO Max. Watch the clip above.

0.4444444444444444,"“Teenage Bounty Hunters” has become the latest one and done series at Netflix.
The series has been canceled by the streamer after only a single season, Variety has confirmed. News of the show’s swift end comes less than two months after debuted, and on the same day that fellow Jenji Kohan series “Glow” was also given the axe.
“Teenage Bounty Hunters” centered around sixteen-year-old fraternal twin sisters Sterling (Maddie Phillips) and Blair (Anjelica Bette Fellini) Wesley who team up with veteran bounty hunter Bowser Jenkins (Kadeem Hardison) for an over-the-top adventure as they dive into the world of bail skipping baddies and suburban secrets while trying to navigate high school drama – love, sex, and study hall. In addition, Virginia Williams starred both as Debbie Wesley, the twins’ mother, and her twin sister Dana Culpepper.
“Teenage Bounty Hunters” was created by Kathleen Jordan, who also wrote and co-executive produced. It emerged as part of “Orange Is the New Black” creator Kohan’s multi-year overall deal with Netflix. With this recent flurry of cancelations, she now only has anthology series “Social Distance” still going on the scripted front, and a docuseries in the pipeline on the un-scripted front.
Kohan, Tara Herrmann, Robert Sudduth, and Blake McCormick also served as executive producers on the 10-episode series. The first episode was directed and executive produced by Jesse Peretz.

*If you know, you know.
This show depicts sibling relationships SO well. Blair and Sterling are best friends and care very deeply for each other, but they also have their ups and downs and misunderstandings, like any sisters. Their relationship just feels very, very real.
From Sterling's coming out journey to her unexpected relationship with April, I honestly don't think I've ever felt more represented. While I wish they had actually used the word ""bisexual"" here, I really loved how perfectly Sterling summed up her feelings with this. I also appreciated that they didn't demonize her previous relationship with Luke or act like her feelings for men weren't also valid. Plus, the way Sterling later explains her sexuality to Blair by describing the colors of the bisexual flag was great.
I literally YELLED at their first kiss — everything about this scene was perfect. Their enemies-to-lovers dynamic truly has me in a chokehold. I loved how their relationship was given just as much depth and screen time as the show's other pairings. I will forever be upset that we aren't getting another season of this chemistry.
Like Sterling and April, they were an unexpected match with great chemistry. Their relationship felt both sweet and realistic. I was heartbroken that the show was canceled before they got a chance to fix things.
Although Sterling and Luke had to deal with the (sadly realistic) backlash they got from their religious community, the show itself never presented sex as a bad thing. The characters weren't ultimately framed as ""right"" or ""wrong"" for making the decision to have sex or not have sex. I also found it refreshing that, for once, there were no pregnancy scares or truly life-changing, lasting ""consequences."" Plus, the scenes didn't feel sensationalized or over-the-top — it just felt like they were depicting realistic (and often imperfect) high school relationships.
He started off as just their grumpy, reluctant employer, but eventually became a true mentor, confidant, and friend to them. I loved the scene where Blair calls him crying after her fight with Sterling and he instantly drops what he's doing to make sure she's okay, even though he's in a dire situation at work.
The episode about the woman wanted for destroying Confederate statues was so layered and well-executed. I also loved how they subverted tropes, such as Miles saying his mom has ""two jobs"" — she's a lawyer and a senator.
April's character is pure genius, and I have such a soft spot for the school leader, Ellen (bless her naive heart). Also, Sterling and Blair both have SO MANY good one-liners. ""Big boy energy!""

0.5,"Composer Bear McCreary has scored some of the seminal sci-fi and fantasy series of our time, from “Battlestar Galactica” to “The Walking Dead” and “Outlander,” but it’s safe to say that nothing quite compares to his experience scoring “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,” which debuts Sept. 2 on Prime Video.
The soundtrack album is being released by Amazon Studios Friday on all streaming services, including McCreary’s Season 1 score and the new main title theme by Howard Shore, who won three Academy Awards for his music for the original “Lord of the Rings” feature-film trilogy and scored the later “Hobbit” trilogy as well.
McCreary’s journey with the characters of Middle-earth began 13 months ago, and the secrecy of the project was such that he couldn’t tell anyone, outside of his music team, that he was doing it.
“I’m trying to honor the legacy of what Howard Shore created, and to do so by using those epic colors, and crafting 15 new themes that can be added to the pantheon of memorable melodies that started with Shore’s films,” he says.
The music for each of the eight episodes was recorded in London for four days, often with 90-piece orchestras; plus a 40-voice choir in Vienna, singing in various Tolkien-created languages; and soloists across Europe and in Los Angeles, playing hardanger fiddle, nyckelharpa, bagpipes, bodhrán drums and other world-music instruments.
“That means whether you are seeing a giant battle, an epic montage, or just two Harfoots sitting in the woods talking, you have the largest orchestra that could fit in Abbey Road or AIR studios supporting them, along with the best soloists in the world and a huge choir,” McCreary says.
The texts are in two Elvish languages, Sindarin and Quenya; the Dwarvish language Khuzdûl; Black Speech, the language of Sauron, creator of the rings; and Adûnaic, the language of the people of Númenor.
Shore’s theme was actually written apart from the McCreary score. “His title is majestic and beautiful. It forms this very inviting fanfare to take us into the world of Middle-earth,” McCreary says.
“The Rings of Power,” however, takes place thousands of years before “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy. “There is a sadness, a wistfulness and a melancholy that is spread across almost all of Shore’s music on those films,” McCreary notes.
“In our show, we are seeing these societies at their peak. So, yes, there’s a connection, but it doesn’t sound the same. In the ‘Hobbit’ films, the dwarfs were a people in diaspora, lost and hoping to retrieve their homeland. Here we see the might of Khazad-dûm, one of the mightiest cities in all of Tolkien’s work, and we see it at its peak. It has this churning industrial energy. It is not sad and forlorn, it’s powerful.
“My hope is that if anyone watches our show and then watches the Peter Jackson films, there will be a continuity of concept,” he says.

Those themes recur throughout the series in different orchestrations and contexts, interlaced with music developed for specific situations. When Galadriel charges after Adar on her horse in that battle sequence, for instance, McCreary decided not to use her theme or his, but a new bit of intense choral music he might reuse for other high-stakes clashes down the line. The process, as McCreary describes it, is a bit like a crossword puzzle, determining what might be appropriate for each character while fitting in with the rest of the score and, more subtly, evoking elements of the music from Peter Jackson’s film series, written by Howard Shore (who also composed Rings of Power’s theme music).
Vulture’s weekly newsletter of the best TV and movie recommendations.
Flip to a random page in one of Tolkien’s books and there’s a good chance you land on a song. The man loved to write lyrics into his works; The Rings of Power, therefore, has its own songs too. The melody of Nori’s song, “This Wandering Day,” sung by Megan Richards, was written before McCreary was hired, with the showrunners working with a group called Plan 9, which wrote songs for Peter Jackson’s films; McCreary then arranged and orchestrated the song for the score. JD Payne, one of the showrunners, wrote the lyrics for that, as well as all the other lyrics in the score — “He’s very lyrically minded,” McCreary said — and McCreary wrote the melody for the song the elves sing on the boat to Valinor, as well as the music for Princess Disa’s “Plea to the Rocks,” sung by Sophia Nomvete. That was recorded live on set, with the dwarven accompaniment arranged around it.
In many places in the score, choral music uses the languages Tolkien invented in his writings. “Anytime you’re hearing text in the choir, a shocking percentage of the run time of the show, that text is in the appropriate language,” McCreary said. They used a total of six languages, counting English, as well as the elven languages Quenya and Sindarin, the dwarven Khuzdul, Númenorian Adûnaic, and the black speech of Mordor in the chanting associated with Sauron.

0.4,"The Real Housewives of Atlanta's Apollo Nida was sentenced to eight years in prison Tuesday, PEOPLE confirms.
Though Nida originally faced up to 30 years in prison for mail, wire and bank fraud, a Georgia judge granted leniency, lessening his sentence for cooperating with a federal investigation.
""On behalf of my client, Apollo, right now, he feels remorse. He thought the judge was fair and accepts his sentence, although he was hoping it would be less,"" Nida's lawyer Thomas D. Bever tells PEOPLE exclusively.
""Apollo is elated that this proceeding is past him and is no longer handing over his head. It meant everything to him that his mother and brother spoke on his behalf. He's okay and will get through this.""
Nida, who appears on the Bravo hit with wife Phaedra Parks, was arrested in January before pleading guilty to the charges in May.
At the time, Bever told PEOPLE, ""By pleading guilty, Mr. Nida admits to his conduct in the past and accepts full responsibility for it.""
These charges aren't the RHOA cast member's first brush with the law: The reality star also served time from 2004 to 2009 for auto title fraud.
Nida and Parks have two children under the age of 4, sons Dylan and Ayden.

E! News can confirm the former Real Housewives of Atlanta star was released from prison at the Fort Dix Correctional Facility.
We've also learned that Apollo has been moved to a Philadelphia halfway house. He is expected to be there until the middle of October.
The news comes more than five years after Apollo pleaded guilty in a massive money fraud scheme. In a courtroom, the former Bravo star took responsibility for identity theft and bank fraud.
""This defendant participated in a sweeping fraud scheme that exploited many segments of the financial system, including phony claims submitted to federal and state agencies, loans secured by vehicles and even basic identity theft associated with stolen checks,"" United States Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said in a statement.
In March 2019, however, E! News learned that Apollo's sentence would be reduced to 84 months ""with credit to be given by the Bureau of Prisons for all time served."" It was a year less than the previous 96-month sentence.

Reality TV fans first met Apollo on the Real Housewives of Atlanta when he was married to Phaedra Parks. The couple had two children together before they settled their divorce in 2017.

0.3,"“For Real,” a seven-part series about the history of reality television that premieres on E! on March 25, is the 14th show Cohen has produced for NBC Universal, a total that includes the eight “Real Housewives” installments currently in rotation on Bravo. Bunim/Murray — a production company iconic in the world of reality TV, having created MTV’s archetypal “The Real World” in 1992 — approached Cohen with the idea for the series in 2019. He’d always wanted to work with the company, he says: “This is the perfect marriage.” With Bunim/Murray, Cohen, who has an overall deal with NBCU and a first-look deal at Bravo, quickly sold the pitch to E!, where it fit in with the channel’s docs programming.
The unscripted genre, spanning nearly 30 years since that “Real World” premiere, which kicked off the modern age of reality, is, as Cohen says, “a vast topic.” To make sense of it, “For Real” divides the seven episodes into subgenres, such as celebreality (“The Osbournes,” “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” and everything in between) or romance (“The Bachelor,” “90 Day Fiancé”), with each episode anchored by sit-down interviews conducted by Cohen.
“It’s a total microaggression, and awful,” Cohen says to Variety.
Cohen is well aware of the criticism leveled at reality television — as one of its most prominent producers, he’s often its target. But as “For Real” illustrates, one striking thing about the genre is that it can’t help revealing the world as it is, whether that’s how people live in the COVID era, or how this season of “The Bachelor,” meant to be the franchise’s victory lap for casting its first Black man as a lead in Matt James, instead has imploded from the weight of the racism inherent in the show itself. “You want to create these escapist shows,” Cohen says, “but the truth is, the real world as it is will always seep in.

At the end of the first episode, a former cult member named Mark Vicente gets emotional in the middle of a talking-head interview as he describes how NXIVM destroyed the early, tender part of his marriage. “I feel like my life with Bonnie was stolen,” Vicente says. “Bonnie got there first.” He’s referring to her realization that the organization they had devoted their lives to was a cult. Then, without any warning, the show skips back in time to an earlier moment of rupture between the couple, when Bonnie laid out her concerns about NXIVM to Mark. “There’s a lot of things I’m starting to see about the organization,” she tells him, while Mark tries to talk her off the ledge: “C’mon, boo. C’mon, c’mon.” “I think some things are going to crumble,” Bonnie says. Cut to closing credits.
I was so compelled I let my kids’ breakfast oatmeal congeal in the pot behind me while I watched. This, I realized, is the way producers on The Bachelor would have told this story. That sounds gross and bad! A thoughtful docuseries about human vulnerability and the search for meaning being reduced to the megadrama of a reality dating-competition show? That move, though — the talking head and the cut to the scene as it unfurled with no demarcation between them, followed by the punch of an episode ending — that’s a reality-TV classic, a bread-and-butter edit for a Real Housewives meltdown. In its documentary sensibility, The Vow is part of a vital, well-established school of fly-on-the-wall filmmaking. Its creators, Karim Amer and Jehane Noujaim, are award-winning directors. But in its TV-ness, in its cliffhanger delights, and in its sustained intimacy over time, The Vow is reality TV polished to a prestige shine, and the qualities it shares with the form are key to why it’s so delicious.
Vulture’s weekly newsletter of the best TV and movie recommendations.
The Vow is just the latest to tap into the surge of popularity for the docuseries format, which was spurred by true-crime works like The Jinx and Making a Murderer (as well as the podcast Serial) and the cultural-history series O. J.: Made in America. In recent years, the form has flourished. In crime and thrillers, there’s Wild Wild Country, The Keepers, and Errol Morris’s Wormwood. In food docuseries, on Netflix alone, a proliferation: Chef’s Table, Ugly Delicious, Salt Fat Acid Heat, Cooked, Street Food. In just 2020: the wildly popular sports series Cheer, the excellent medical docu-series Lenox Hill, the true crime–cum–biography I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, Chef’s Table: BBQ, and, inescapably, Tiger King.
Documentaries have always carried with them an air of legitimacy and highbrow sheen. But the arc of the docuseries in the past five years — the way a show like Tiger King was able to consume all the cultural oxygen this spring — reminds me of what happened to TV dramas over the past two decades. The distinction between a network drama and one made for a premium-cable outlet (called, variously, “prestige TV,” “quality TV,” “TV that’s actually a movie,” and “TV that’s better because it’s not really TV”) came down to narrowly defined specialness. The latter was more expensive, it often employed dense storytelling and playful cinematography, it demanded all of the viewer’s attention, and there were fewer episodes. A similar pattern underlies the explosion of the docuseries, which emerged from the world of documentary filmmaking but also from a television landscape primed by decades of reality TV.
The boom in true crime, for instance, stems largely from the influential documentary film The Thin Blue Line (1988) and the docuseries The Staircase (2004). But those works are also refined, more expensive, in-depth iterations of shows like Unsolved Mysteries, The FBI Files, Forensic Files, and the entire oeuvre of Nancy Grace. The many culinary docuseries over the past several years, which show cooking in hagiographic slow motion and treat food culture as all-serious ethnographies, are capitalizing on a long-established audience for reality food TV, a genre big and multifaceted enough to fill its own cookery-competition universe. Examples like Deaf U, out this October on Netflix, are docuseries instantiations of shows from the large and lucrative world of insular-subculture series, like Keeping Up With the Kardashians, 19 Kids and Counting, Duck Dynasty, and Toddlers & Tiaras, and shows like Teen Mom, Jon & Kate Plus 8, and Little People, Big World, about challenging, often unusual life experiences. Following the TLC and MTV format for reality shows, a docuseries like Tiger King takes charismatic people in abnormal circumstances and turns their lives into objects of subculture tourism. They invite viewers to tour unfamiliar worlds, the inner lives of everyone from polygamists, to people with disabilities, to — Can you imagine? — people who live in the South.
Anglo-American culture has yet to meet something lowbrow that it didn’t find a way to repackage as classy and valuable. (See bawdy Renaissance plays, 19th-century serial fiction, soap operas.) And on the major networks or on cable channels like TLC and A&E, most reality shows are trash. This is hardly a secret — many are proudly lowbrow, and they’re treated by viewers and network buyers alike as disposable. Some are junky, cheaply made series that run forever, but even for a show with sky-high production values, like The Real Housewives, they are unreservedly mucky in tone and story. They come with the added voyeuristic kick of being real. Or realish. Real enough for that oomph of busybody pleasure.
There’s an important distinction between the way most reality shows are made and the foundational ethos of a docuseries. Reality shows are cast, tested, poked, prodded, often prewritten, and edited to shape stories that would not otherwise have existed. Docuseries, for the most part, film their subjects as they are. There’s still opportunity to mold the story that appears onscreen — by changing how it unfolds, whose perspectives are prioritized, which excerpts to use out of many hours of filmed footage, whom to include and whom to leave out. Still, the aim of documentary filmmaking is typically to approach the subject from a direction that’s entirely inverted from that of reality TV. Reality producers start with a story and find subjects to fit; docuseries producers start with subjects and wait to see what the story will be.
Underneath, though, I could feel my brain pinging in response to The Vow in the way it does to reality programming — to the voyeuristic closeness of it. The same is true for long stretches of Netflix’s college-football docuseries, Last Chance U, and the entirety of Tiger King. Joe Exotic, the subject of the latter series, had been trying to make a reality show about himself featuring much of the same material that ended up in the docuseries. But by folding the reality-show production into the docuseries narrative, Tiger King could take advantage of the material while holding itself at arm’s length. Being about a reality show feels superior to being one. The central appeal of one of my favorite docuseries from the past two years, Showtime’s Couples Therapy, is that its directors were able to capture therapy as it happened over the course of several months. It’s like being in a room with couples as they discuss their most private thoughts. And while its art design and ethical foundation are vastly different, Couples Therapy is so much like a reality-show premise that it was the premise for a six-season reality show on VH1 also called Couples Therapy. Putting the two series side by side is an uncanny illustration of prestige glow-up. On one side, night-vision footage of Flavor Flav storming out of a bedroom in a mansion where celebrity couples have been sequestered to create reality-TV drama. On the other, a wood-paneled, neutral-toned therapist’s office where a clinical psychologist looks carefully at the well-heeled couple across from her on the sofa.
As I listened to Amer discuss the “novelistic” elements of the docuseries, I thought about all the ways that comparison makes sense. One of the great innovations of the European novel was free indirect discourse. It offered new modes to access someone else’s private self, creating an almost alarming proximity with characters by allowing their interiority to slip into a narrator’s voice. What better comparison to the overwhelming intimacy of The Vow? But in the same moment, I thought about Charles McGrath announcing that TV is the “prime-time novel” in a 1995 New York Times Magazine essay and how many times David Simon’s work has been compared with Dickens’s. How often have I heard TV creatives describe their prestige dramas as “novelistic” and “Dickensian”? Docuseries are the newest conversation-consuming form — adding a nod to Dickens is just the chef’s kiss of TV legitimacy.

0.2,"The influential sci-fi author has never been properly adapted for the screen before. Lisa Joy and Vincenzo Natali explain what inspired them to turn his 2014 novel into a new Amazon series.
Christian Holub is a writer covering comics and other geeky pop culture. He's still mad about 'Firefly' getting canceled.
Wiliam Gibson is unquestionably one of the fathers of modern science fiction. It's hard to imagine The Matrix existing without Gibson's debut novel Neuromancer, or the entire subgenre of steampunk without The Difference Engine (which Gibson co-wrote with Bruce Sterling). But despite this extensive influence, none of Gibson's works have ever been directly adapted for the screen before. That changes this week with the premiere of The Peripheral on Amazon Prime Video.
Adapted from Gibson's 2014 novel of the same name, The Peripheral stars Chloe Grace Moretz and Jack Reynor as Flynne and Burton Fisher, siblings from 2032 America who make money playing video games (or ""simulations"") for high-paying customers in order to afford much-needed medicine for their dying mother (Melinda Page Hamilton). All is not what it seems with those simulations, but perhaps some of this set-up sounds familiar in a world where the ""metaverse"" gets mentioned more every day and life-saving drugs only get pricier.
""I feel like the world has grown into the book,"" says director Vincenzo Natali (Cube), who helmed the first episode. ""The book was written in 2014, even before Trump was elected, and in the most exciting and chilling way, it just feels like it's coming to fruition.""
Natali had long wanted to adapt Neuromancer for the screen, but it never quite came together. After he secured the rights to The Peripheral, he brought it to Westworld creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, who know a thing or two about ambitious sci-fi.
""William Gibson has always been an iconic author, I just love his work,"" Joy tells EW. ""And when a director who I love as much as Vincenzo comes to me and says, 'Hey, I have the rights to this William Gibson book,' I'm like, say no more! I'm in!""
Joy continues, ""The material is just so incredible. I read it all that night when Vincenzo first brought it to us. I couldn't put it down. It's Gibson at his best in terms of complete immersive world creation and almost uncanny ability to predict the future — so much so that many of the things he's predicted have already come to pass as of today. But he combines it with what feels like a really personal story.""
Westworld taught Joy and Nolan important lessons about making sci-fi shows — namely, that a dose of reality really helps sell the fantastic.
""The major thing that we took away from Westworld, production-wise, was that shooting on location is always helpful,"" Joy says. ""Not only for the performances to be interacting with the real, but for the effect on screen. Especially when dealing with a world that is artificial, it helps when you're basing something off of reality. So we shot in both London and the U.S. and, you know, that presents challenges. There's a lot of block shooting that has to be done, and there's a lot of coordination.""
Natali adds, ""the Jonah/Lisa shooting paradigm of like, 'let's not build, let's discover' really helped us because both of those places were beautiful and fascinating to discover. There's a tendency in science fiction and fantasy to be very additive in design and to just fill the frame with stuff. I wanted very much to approach it almost in a subtractive way, where we just make very distinct changes — which, ironically, actually are more impactful than if you just threw a lot of stuff at the screen.""
Natali says Gibson himself has been a ""wonderful partner"" on the adaptation, and is ""enthusiastic"" about the show.
""It's very exciting that after all these decades of influence, Mr. Gibson finally gets to see something of his reach the screen intact,"" Natali says. ""More than anything, I just wanted him to be happy.""
The first two episodes of The Peripheral are streaming now on Prime Video, with subsequent installments coming weekly.

As “The Peripheral” — which stars Chloë Grace Moretz, Gary Carr and Jack Reynor as three futuristic characters whose lives intersect in what Joy calls “the coolest video game ever” — finally premieres on Friday, the project’s release marks a transitional time for Nolan and Joy. The pair are still tied to Warner Bros. Discovery through “Westworld,” though the show is awaiting word on a fifth (and what Nolan says would definitely be final) season, and “The Peripheral” is a co-production between Warner Bros. TV and Amazon — but they’ve also just spent the summer filming the first two episodes of their adaptation of the “Fallout” video games as a series for Amazon, while plotting multiple other titles at the streamer.
“The Peripheral” was set up prior to your Amazon deal. Where did the idea to do it come from, and why with Amazon?
Jonathan Nolan: It came from Vincenzo Natali, who we’ve worked with several times before, wonderful director. He walked into our office and said, “I’ve got my dream project.” And he had been talking to William Gibson, they have been friends for quite some time. For me, it started even earlier than that. I think I was 14 when I read “Count Zero” first, and then I worked my way back to “Neuromancer.” I was always reading nonlinearly when I was a kid, a particular foible of mine. And I just was dazzled by Gibson’s prose and his unparalleled ability to imagine worlds into existence. He’s one of the greatest American minds in science fiction.
Lisa Joy: He’s like a modern-day prophet.
Nolan: Yeah! But also able to vividly, warmly imagine these worlds and these characters. It’s astonishing to me to see how much influence his work has had. I moved to Los Angeles in ’99 and started working in film and TV, and watched as many, many films and series were influenced by Gibson’s work — but no one actually really had the guts to go back to the source, in part because his work is so imaginative, so richly detailed, so complex. But I think everyone was kind of chickenshit, honestly. And certainly his work influenced mine over and over and over again.
We’re sitting in the hotel where we shot part of the pilot for “Person of Interest,” which is my first TV series, which is very heavily influenced by Gibson’s work — that idea that our technologies get to a point where they just start to take on a life of their own. In some cases, it’s sitting invisibly underneath our world. And so when that Vincenzo came to us and said, this is something I want to do, can you help? We absolutely jumped at the prospect.
Joy: I too love Gibson, and love Vincenzo. When I first read “The Peripheral,” I found it particularly exciting because I think it’s one of his most emotional works. And not only does it have his signature prophetic kind of futurism — which in “The Peripheral” isn’t so far in the future anymore, we’re really seeing the events of “The Peripheral” play out even today — but the thing that really drew me in was the idea of Flynne Fisher and her world. And the characters in Clanton, which is just a very relatable snapshot of America. An America that you don’t always see, especially in science fiction. They live in the South in Clanton, and it’s this tight-knit community of Flynne and her family and their friends.
Nolan: Based a little bit on Gibson’s childhood. He grew up in West Virginia, and you can feel it in the book, that he is writing about his home.
Joy: It’s very warm in that way. And the future is only worth fighting for if you have something to love in the present that you want to hold onto and cherish and protect. And we see in Flynne’s world the relationships she has that make it worthwhile to rise to the level of superhero.
Joy: Just speaking first to the world of Clanton, it is the future, but it’s so immediate feeling that the touches of futurism feel like the present. Especially because William Gibson said, the future is here, it’s just unevenly distributed — the idea of the future in Singapore for a very wealthy person versus somewhere else with people with less resources, there are technologies that exist that are astounding right now, they’re just unevenly distributed. So it might be the future in Clanton, but it feels very much like the present today in, say, New York. So grounding it in that moment, that’s just really accessible. Flynne Fisher’s home feels and looks a lot to me like the home I was in in New Jersey when I grew up. It’s just kind of cozy, modest. They do have a sort of Roomba device that’s next-level — but it’s just little touches like that that show appliances are a little bit different, the ways in which, say, the corner market or the 7-Eleven work is different because of printing technology. But it really feels to me like what Kmart felt like when I was a kid and we would go there for food, for clothes, for pretzels afterwards, if we were well behaved. So that’s one quote-unquote future, but to me it it feels totally current.
Nolan: Gibson spent so long living in the future and living far in the future, imagining wholly transformed cultures, for him to fix his gaze, say five minutes in the future — we started developing books a couple of years ago, and it feels like it’s right around the corner. And the most technologically advanced thing in that world are the physical vestiges of the government’s Haptic systems that Jack Reynor’s character, Burton, carries around in his body. The idea that you have parts of rural America that are being left behind, that their closest intersection with advanced technology is the people who spent their time in the military and then come home and carry these things around with them felt very acute, very smart, very in line with where things are headed. And the picture of Flynne and Burton’s community felt, when you read the book, felt almost uncanny. You’d say it’s not prophecy — it’s an inevitability at this point. This is where parts of our country and our world are headed, that feeling of a technological diaspora. You could feel their world rubbing up against this much more technologically advanced world and the pieces of it shaping where they do their shopping and how they get their groceries and their medicine. That all felt almost telepathic coming from Gibson’s book, his ability to look at that and know it.
But it also has, as Lisa said, this warmth underlying it, which we immediately responded to. A lot of Gibson’s work is set in the far future — is set in Tokyo, is set in world capitals. This one, for Lisa’s point and mine, since I grew up in suburban Illinois, reminded both of us a little bit of our childhood, as it comes from Bill [Gibson]’s childhood. So the warmth and familiarity of that, in contrast to the hyper futuristic London that Chloë’s character finds herself interacting with, the contrast was just delicious. Very, very exciting on a textural level, but also on a thematic level.
Remaining in spoiler-free territory, is there anything you want to warn book readers about that might be a deviation from “The Peripheral” book that was made for the onscreen adaptation?
Joy: I think it’s not a warning. We’re really excited that when Scott Smith, who’s a brilliant writer, and Vincenzo brought on this project, I think sometimes the best way of honoring a piece of writing that is as great as all of Gibson’s writing is is to understand, in a book form, it looks like this, and then in a series, to do it justice, certain things have to change and evolve in order to reach the same effect. Because it’s just totally different medium. And so Gibson has been really supportive and excited, honestly, about staying true to the feeling and intent of the book and those themes, while also making sure that it is presenting the best way the serialized TV format. So the departures you’ll see are almost immediate, and I don’t think that anybody should be taking the letter of the law as any kind of road map. But it feels very Gibsonian still.
Nolan: Yeah, it honors the spirit of the book. It’s a fairly close adaptation. It’s just a thrill for me, personally, to be working with and collaborating with someone whose work was so influential on mine.
How did you land on Chloë Grace Moretz and Gary Carr as your leads?
Joy: It’s really no decision — it’s just an amazing, wonderful windfall to be able to work with talents like Chloë and Gary. We’ve been fans of their works for a long time. And Chloë’s from the South and there is something so relatable and warm and yet completely badass about her. So when she slips into the role of Flynne, it feels like a second skin in some way. It just feels like, oh, there she is, there’s our Flynne. And Gary, if I had a voice from the future calling me to join it, I’d be so excited to find that it was Gary. I’d be like, hell yeah, let’s do this. This is just wish fulfillment for me how it all worked out.
Nolan: It’s a conversation from the beginning, always when we embark on these, to have a plan. You also have to have the confidence to let the plan evolve. This was a unique proposition because Bill was writing a sequel to the book as Scott was writing the first season with Greg Plageman and the rest of the writers. You have the fascinating prospect of, you start from the same point and see where the potentially divergent directions in which two terrific writers can take the same stories. We’re very excited to see the way in which the series evolves.
One of the things that Bill does with the books is he has the ability to jump around, especially given the brilliant conceit. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about time travel for different projects over the years, most notably “Interstellar” — thinking about multiple worlds and thinking about time travel, and spending a lot of time talking to physicists about it, and thought I had some pretty clever ideas about it — and then read “The Peripheral” and was like, oh shit, you nailed it. He just nailed the answer to the question of, how can you weave a narrative inside the concept of time travel, which is not exactly fitting here, somehow, because Gibson’s take on it is so throughly worked out. He just nailed how you could reconcile these things together in a way that, for me, feels completely congruent and true. The concept of time travel is inherently slippery. And it can also, potentially, work against narrative as well. You say, if you can go back and change anything, what does it matter then? Gibson nails this idea of, you can go back and change something, but that creates its own, what he calls, “stub,” a sort of pocket universe. And they’re all equally viable universes. So as a conceit for where you could take a television series, I would have to say it’s about as rich as you can possibly get with possibilities.
Joy: The other thing is, Jonah is a gaming nerd. So all this fancy talk he just did, we had kids and he had less time to game. Here’s a book where it’s like awesomest game ever. And it’s real. And just like I want to go into a future where Gary is waiting to show me London, he wants a future where he can play the coolest video game ever and then honestly just kick ass and save the world. So there’s a little something there for everyone. And in this day and age, the idea of escapism, whether it’s social media or video games, we live so much of our lives now in that space and it’s just so relatable. Life can be humdrum, and we find ways to fill our days and play roles that we wish we could have in life. And in this series and in Gibson’s book, this game is a portal to the worlds that could be and to the selves that could be. And it’s just a really fascinating transformational hero’s journey that has this classic architecture that’s difficult to resist because it’s just so compelling and so universal in its appeal.
On the seasons-long plan topic, do you see another season for “Westworld” and would that be the final season?
Nolan: We had always conceived of a fifth and final season. We’re still in conversations with the network.
Back to “Fallout,” after we just talked about one of the best games ever, when does your series take place and how much of the past will we see?
Nolan: Can’t talk about “Fallout” just yet except to say that we’re very, very excited. And we think the fans of the game will be very excited too.
That was a great answer, Jonah. Lisa, when does “Fallout” take place?
Joy: You’d have to ask the director. I like that you know I’m the weak link. He’s right here, dude. Right next to me. How helpful can I be?

""He was a brilliant focus puller and a great guy to have on set,"" he wrote. ""He always arrived with a smile and left with that same smile at the end of the day. He was the type of person I love to have in my team but more importantly, in my life. And he lent me his very cool bag of custom made crystals that brought a bit of magic to some of my frames. That was Gunnar - a little bit of magic that touched a lot of lives. We will miss him.""
