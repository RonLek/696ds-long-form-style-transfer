0.833333333333333,"Short-term life insurance can be a helpful way to provide financial protection for your loved ones in case of your death. Read to learn more about short-term life insurance and if it's right for you.
Short-term life insurance, also known as temporary or short-term coverage, is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a short period of time. Short-term life insurance generally lasts for less than a year. This type of policy can be a good option for those who need coverage for only a limited amount of time and who may not be able to afford traditional long-term life insurance plans.
Different from permanent life insurance, which offers complete coverage for the duration of an individual's lifetime, short-term plans generally offer coverage of less than one year, with some allowing you to extend your coverage when the initial term expires if needed.
Short-term life insurance works the same as a typical term life insurance policy. During the term, the policyholder pays premiums to the life insurance company to keep the coverage in force. If the policyholder dies during the term of the policy, the death benefit is paid out to the named beneficiaries.
If the policyholder does not die during the term of the policy, then no death benefit is paid out and the coverage simply expires. In some cases, it may be possible to renew short-term life insurance policies, but this will typically come with higher premiums due to the increased risk associated with insuring an older person.
Two common short-term life insurance options are temporary policies and annual renewable life insurance plans.
Temporary life insurance is designed to provide protection when you get a long-term life insurance policy. Coverage is effective immediately and lasts until the primary life insurance policy you applied for goes into effect. The purpose of a temporary life insurance policy is to cover you while waiting for the underwriting of a primary life insurance policy to be completed and the policy to be in force.
Annual renewable life insurance offers more flexibility than temporary policies. They are one-year term life insurance policies that you can renew every year or let the coverage expire. One benefit is that during the stated period, you can renew without having to reapply or take another medical exam. However the premiums will generally go up every year and can be more expensive than getting a term policy lasting 10 to 20 years.
While anyone may benefit from having some level of life insurance coverage in place, certain groups may find this type of plan especially appealing.
If you have applied for a traditional term or whole life insurance policy and are waiting for the underwriting to be completed, then short-term life insurance can be a good bridge to cover the gap in coverage. This type of policy is also good if you need temporary coverage to cover short-term debt in case something should happen to you.
This type of policy is ideal for people who need coverage temporarily and who do not want to commit to a long-term contract. It may also be a good choice for those who need coverage while they are in their early working years and may not yet have the financial means or stable enough income for a long-term life insurance policy. For a young, healthy adult looking for the most inexpensive life insurance policy, an annual renewable policy may be a good short-term fit.
Individuals who are out of work temporarily could benefit from access to affordable life insurance as well. Many employers offer life insurance to their employees, usually offering a benefit of up to $50,000. Until you get another job with an employer that offers life insurance, short-term life insurance can help cover the gap in employment.
If a person is going through a divorce or has temporarily moved to a more dangerous job or environment, then a short-term life insurance policy can help cover them until life has stabilized and they can get a traditional life insurance policy.
Your life insurance premium for a traditional policy will be based on your health, age, occupation, hobbies, and several other factors. If you believe you can improve your health or lifestyle to later reduce your premium, then a temporary policy can help provide protection until then.
Short-term life insurance policies can be used as a temporary measure to help cover expenses in the event of your death, such as funeral costs. However, it is important to remember that short-term life insurance is not a permanent solution and should not be relied upon as your only source of life insurance coverage. Here are some alternatives to consider instead.
A short-term life insurance policy is a term life policy that only covers a year. You can get a long-term policy to cover five to 10 years or even longer. This is an inexpensive way to help provide peace of mind without having to worry about renewing every year. If you die during the term of the policy, your beneficiaries will receive the death benefit. If you do not die during the term, then no death benefit is paid out and the coverage simply expires.
Permanent life insurance policies provide coverage for the policyholder's entire life, but they are more expensive. Permanent policies, such as whole life insurance, are more comprehensive and offer both death benefits and cash value accumulation. Whole life policies typically have higher premiums than term life policies, but they also provide lifelong protection and can build up cash value over time.
Ultimately, the decision to purchase short-term life insurance will depend on your individual situation and needs. Therefore, it is important to weigh all of these considerations carefully before making any decisions. But those in need of temporary coverage should certainly consider this viable life insurance option.
Short-term life insurance, also known as temporary or short-term coverage, is a type of insurance plan that provides protection for one year or less.

With COVID-19 shutdowns easing across the country, many Americans are finding themselves in a time of transition. If you’re switching jobs, working on your health or trying to pay off a debt, a short-term life insurance policy could cover you until your situation changes.
There are two types of short-term life insurance: annual renewable term, or ART, and temporary life insurance.
Annual renewable term life insurance is a one-year policy that renews annually for a set number of years. This means you can refresh your coverage without reapplying or taking a medical exam. Think of it as a one-year contract: When the year is up, you can choose to either keep or let go of your policy.
The catch? Over time, ART can end up being much more expensive than the average life insurance rates for standard term life policies.
“The price goes up every year because your risk of dying goes up every year,” explains Elaine Tumicki, corporate vice president of insurance product research at LIMRA, a life insurance trade group.
Only 6% of term life insurance policies sold in 2020 were annual renewable term, according to LIMRA’s 2020 U.S. Retail Life Insurance Sales Survey.
Some insurers also offer temporary life insurance to applicants waiting to be approved for a traditional policy. Getting regular term or permanent life insurance can take four to eight weeks, and the temporary policy helps you avoid going without coverage.
1. You’re waiting on a long-term life insurance policy.
If your insurer offers you temporary life insurance while you’re applying for a traditional policy, it’s generally worth accepting. Your policy goes into effect once you pay your first premium, and it typically provides the same amount of coverage as the primary policy you’re applying for.
2. You want to cover a short-term debt.
This could be a credit card balance, a personal loan or a mortgage, if you’re close to paying it off. A short-term policy can provide coverage while you’re still in debt and prevent your family from having to take on that responsibility if you die prematurely.
Annual renewable term life works for new business owners, too. “If you borrowed money to start that crafting business, food truck, or new software business and intended to pay off the debt with profits in the first few years, then ART could be a great fit to protect your family from that debt should something happen to you,” John Graves, licensed life insurance agent and founder of G&H Financial Group, said in an email.
More than half of working Americans get life insurance through work, according to LIMRA’s 2021 Insurance Barometer Study. If you need to bridge a gap in coverage before returning to work or starting a new job, an ART policy could tide you over. Once you’re able to enroll in group life insurance with your new employer, you can cancel your short-term policy.
4. You’re temporarily working a dangerous job.
Insurers may charge higher rates if you walk into a hazardous workplace every day. If you’re briefly working a dangerous job like mining or logging, you might be better off with a short-term policy. Then you can shop for cheaper premiums after you’ve wrapped up that job.
5. You’re improving your health or changing your lifestyle.
While you’re trying to lose weight, recover from an illness, quit smoking or otherwise improve your health, a short-term policy can protect your family in the meantime, Graves said.
Once you’re over the bump, you can apply for a traditional policy and potentially score a lower rate.
6. You have other temporary life insurance needs.
Maybe you need life insurance as part of a divorce decree. Maybe rates for a standard policy would be high because you’re on probation, or you’ve been diagnosed with gestational diabetes during pregnancy. In these cases, short-term coverage could satisfy that need without locking you into a longer policy.
Life insurance is meant to be flexible, which is why there are so many options on the market. When short-term coverage won’t cut it, consider a traditional policy. Term life insurance, which lasts a set number of years, is generally inexpensive and sufficient for most families. For lifelong coverage, consider a permanent policy such as whole life or universal life insurance.
“It’s really up to the individual,"" Tumicki says. ""Whatever their life insurance need is, they need to match that to the product that fits it.""

0.816666666666667,"Cybersecurity is a massive challenge. According to IBM's (IBM  0.18%) Cost of a Data Breach 2021 report, the average cost incurred for an organization that suffered a data breach event last year rose 10% to $4.2 million. A steady migration to cloud-based IT infrastructure and a hybrid workforce that spends significant amounts of time outside the office aren't making security any easier. As a result, cybersecurity is a big and fast-growing industry.
But picking the best cybersecurity stocks can be tricky. Cybersecurity is a large chunk of the technology space, and every sector of the economy needs software to help keep data and critical systems secure. There are a lot of companies operating in this niche, each with its own take on structuring a security platform. That's why investing in a cybersecurity ETF (exchange-traded fund) might make sense.
Given the growing demand for cybersecurity, it's no surprise there are a number of ETF options to choose from. Here are the top choices for 2022 and beyond.
With almost $5.6 billion in assets under management, the First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF is by far the largest pure-play ETF in this part of the technology sector. First Trust is a large financial services firm offering a variety of investment products, and its cybersecurity offering is one of the longest-tenured in the ETF world. Its inception date was back in 2015, and shares of the fund have more than doubled since then.
The First Trust Cybersecurity ETF is currently made up of 35 cybersecurity company stocks, almost all of which are listed on a U.S. stock exchange. A handful of stocks are in adjacent industries, such as aerospace and defense, where security services feature prominently. At the time of this writing, the top three holdings (which make up about 20% of the fund's assets) are large tech companies Cisco Systems (CSCO  -0.42%), Palo Alto Networks (PANW  6.74%), and Accenture (ACN  0.54%). The ETF is rebalanced quarterly and has an annual expense ratio of 0.6% ($6 in fees are deducted from the fund's performance each year for every $1,000 invested).
The ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF has also been around since 2015 and has amassed $1.9 billion in assets. It is also rebalanced quarterly, has an annual expense ratio of 0.6%, and has more than doubled in value since its inception.
The big difference between it and First Trust's offering, though, is that the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF is made up of 62 stocks. That means far less portfolio concentration of top names in the industry and more of the fund's investments spread out into smaller companies and international investments. That broader exposure might appeal to some investors, but the strategy has underperformed the First Trust fund since 2015.
A relative newcomer, the Global X Cybersecurity ETF was launched in late 2019. It quickly attracted more than $1.1 billion in investor funds and has outperformed both First Trust and ETFMG since it launched.
The Global X Cybersecurity ETF is one of the most concentrated on this list, with just 31 stocks. It is heavily weighted toward large cybersecurity software companies. At the time of this writing, Check Point Software (CHKP  1.16%), Palo Alto Networks, and NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK) make up almost one-quarter of the fund's total assets. Like the other ETFs here, Global X's product pays little in the way of dividends since the cybersecurity industry is focused primarily on growth. However, it has outperformed its peers in its short history.

Also launched in 2019, the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF comes from one of the largest financial institutions in the world, BlackRock (BLK  0.85%). It is composed of 52 different cybersecurity company stocks and other tech companies involved in cybersecurity, and it has a lower annual fee than many of its peers, at just 0.47%.
In its brief existence, the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF has underperformed other funds in the cybersecurity space. But since it has a limited history, that could change. This ETF also isn't the most security-focused ETF around. It has a smattering of cloud computing names that are in security-adjacent niches, such as cloud infrastructure company VMware (NYSE:VMW), networking equipment designer Juniper Networks (JNPR  0.11%), and digital document-signing service DocuSign (DOCU  -1.65%).
The WisdomTree Cybersecurity Fund is the newest ETF on this list, with an inception date of January 2021. Technology stocks -- including many cybersecurity names -- have been hit hard since then, and WisdomTree's product reflects that, with a negative return since its launch. However, while the company has only accumulated about $35 million in assets so far, it has a competitively priced offering at only 0.45% in annual fees.
This ETF is also the most concentrated fund here and is spread across just 27 cybersecurity stocks. At almost 8% of the fund as of this writing, Palo Alto Networks is by far the largest holding. Data analytics and cybersecurity monitoring outfit Datadog (DDOG  1.11%) and cybersecurity and compliance software company Rapid7 (RPD  -0.33%) round out the top three spots. The stocks within this ETF are rebalanced twice a year.
Vanguard, whose founder, Jack Bogle, invented the index fund in 1976, doesn't have a specific ETF solely focused on cybersecurity. However, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is worth mentioning. It is a broad-based index of the U.S. technology sector and is full of cybersecurity companies and other large businesses involved in security in some form.
With an annual expense ratio of just 0.1% and 359 total holdings, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a great way for investors to get passive exposure (since holdings aren't rebalanced) to the development of cybersecurity, along with other growth trends in technology such as cloud computing and semiconductor designers. The fund has been around since 2004 and has averaged just over 13% annually in returns.

Cybersecurity: A Burgeoning Industry with Significant Growth Potential

The importance of robust cybersecurity measures cannot be overstated, particularly in today's digital landscape. According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach 2021 report, the average cost of a data breach incident rose 10% to a staggering $4.2 million last year. The shift towards cloud-based IT infrastructure and hybrid workforces has only exacerbated the complexity of cybersecurity threats. As a result, the cybersecurity industry is projected to experience substantial growth in the coming years.

Identifying the Most Promising Cybersecurity Stocks: A Challenging Task

The cybersecurity sector is a significant component of the technology space, with every industry sector relying on software to safeguard data and critical systems. Consequently, there are numerous companies operating in this niche, each offering unique security solutions. Investing in a cybersecurity exchange-traded fund (ETF) can be an attractive option for investors seeking to capitalize on the growing demand for cybersecurity.

Top Cybersecurity ETFs for 2022 and Beyond

The market offers a variety of cybersecurity ETF options, each with its distinct features and investment strategies. Here are the top cybersecurity ETFs to consider:

1. First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF (FTXH)

With approximately $5.6 billion in assets under management, the First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF is the largest pure-play ETF in the cybersecurity space. Launched in 2015, this ETF has more than doubled in value since its inception. The fund comprises 35 cybersecurity company stocks, mostly listed on U.S. exchanges, with a significant allocation to large tech companies such as Cisco Systems, Palo Alto Networks, and Accenture. The ETF is rebalanced quarterly and has an annual expense ratio of 0.6%.

2. ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK)

The ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF, also launched in 2015, has amassed around $1.9 billion in assets. Similar to the First Trust ETF, it is rebalanced quarterly and has an annual expense ratio of 0.6%. The key difference lies in its composition, featuring 62 stocks, which provides a more diversified portfolio with less concentration in top names.

3. Global X Cybersecurity ETF (BUG)

Launched in late 2019, the Global X Cybersecurity ETF has quickly attracted over $1.1 billion in investor funds. With a concentrated portfolio of 31 stocks, the ETF is heavily weighted towards large cybersecurity software companies such as Check Point Software, Palo Alto Networks, and NortonLifeLock. Notably, it has outperformed its peers since its inception.

4. iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (IHAK)

The iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF, launched in 2019, is composed of 52 different cybersecurity company stocks and other tech companies involved in cybersecurity. With a lower annual fee of 0.47%, this ETF offers a more diversified portfolio with a smattering of cloud computing names.

5. WisdomTree Cybersecurity Fund (WCBR)

The WisdomTree Cybersecurity Fund, launched in January 2021, is the newest ETF on this list. Despite a negative return since its launch, it has a competitively priced offering at only 0.45% in annual fees. The ETF is highly concentrated, with just 27 cybersecurity stocks, and is rebalanced twice a year.

Investing in Cybersecurity ETFs: A Strategic Move

Investing in a cybersecurity ETF can provide a cost-effective way to tap into the growth potential of this critical technology sector. With computing technology increasingly integral to the global economy, cybersecurity is poised to emerge as a key secular growth trend in the coming decade. While individual cybersecurity stocks may exhibit volatility, investing in a diversified basket of them can yield substantial returns over the long term.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Investopedia:

Square (SQ) and Stripe have emerged as two popular payment processing services for small and growing businesses. Square focuses largely on in-person payments while Stripe was designed for online transactions. As the services have become widely used, their simple fixed-rate payment processing fees have drawn in big-name supporters to use and promote their systems. For investors and business owners, it’s important to understand how these companies operate to make smart financial decisions in the rapidly shifting payment processing industry.
Square has been widely adopted by mobile and brick-and-mortar businesses alike. To further extend its reach among the latter, Square released a physical Square Stand in May 2013 that transforms iPads into traditional cash registers.
The company has also built out its software suite to better handle diverse product sales from a predefined menu or inventory. Thought there have still been some reports of this system freezing. Later product additions include inventory management, appointment management, analytics, invoicing, online ordering, gift cards, and capital management tools.
What Square is to mobile payment processing, Stripe is to Internet payment processing. Stripe, which was founded in 2010 by two Irish entrepreneurs, charges 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction with discounts available for high-volume clients.89 Like Square, Stripe doesn’t have any monthly service fees and only charges business owners when a payment is processed.
Stripe, which was designed with online developers in mind, makes it easy to integrate a variety of online payment processing tools and plugins through its API. Sites on common platforms like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla can use Stripe for invoice payments, ticket sales, and physical goods sales, among other applications.
Both companies target all businesses that do not want to pay monthly transaction fees and do not want to be burdened with expensive payment processing equipment or complex contracts. Both companies offer similar, automated direct deposits within a few days of processing each transaction, so clients will have fast access to cash after each payment takes place.
Square does still offer slightly lower costs, at a rate of 2.6% plus $0.10 per transaction, while Stripe charges a flat rate of 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction.49 This difference in fees relates to the difference in products. Online payments have a greater risk for fraud than in-person transactions, meaning Stipe has increased costs when it comes to protecting against this possibility.
Square was designed specifically for in-person, on-the-go transactions, using a payment processing adapter that acts as a card reader and can plug into phones, tablets and other devices. The company also offers some Internet payment processing options through its online platform Cash App. However, this is focused on person-to-person payments rather than online business transactions.
Stripe, on the other hand, was designed specifically to make processing Internet transactions easier. The company is able to bring together many different online processing tools and plugins to work for a variety of Internet-focused businesses. It also now offers an in-person payment tool, Terminal, but online payments still remain Stripe's main focus.
Square and Stripe are major disruptors in traditional payment processing, a space long dominated by large banks. Overturning the traditional monthly merchant account fees and transaction fees allows many more businesses to access credit and debit customers, further shifting the competitive landscape from traditional businesses to startups and growing small to medium-sized companies.
As these companies continue to innovate and add new products such as loans, consumers and business owners can expect further changes that will make payment processing easier and more accessible. As cash becomes less prevalent and consumers continue to shift towards plastic en masse, these electronic payment processing companies can be expected to grow and more competitors are likely to enter the space.
However, for online-only businesses, Stripe may be a better choice since it was designed to focus entirely on Internet payment processing.
Square and Stripe offer payment processing services. These services are specifically designed for use by small and growing businesses.
Square works, predominantly, through a small adapter that plugs into a cell phone or other device. It can process card payments and handle a wide range of product sales. There is a $0.10 processing fee per transaction and a flat rate charge of 2.6%.
Stripe, on the other hand, focuses on helping businesses more easily process online transactions. It also recently created Terminal, an on-site debit and credit card reader that works much like Square's device. There is a $0.30 fee per transaction and a 2.9% flat rate charge.
Square is geared toward in-person transactions so it is the best option for business owners who need to process payments on the go. Stripe focuses mainly on Internet transactions, therefore it's the best option for those who conduct the majority of their business digitally.
Investopedia examined multiple data points from both companies, such as fees, ease of use, company history, and intended purpose of their services, to make this comparison. In addition, we examined each company's role and impact on the banking and payment processing industry overall.

Stripe and Square are both payment processors that allow businesses to accept credit and debit cards, digital wallets and more. The main difference is that Square prioritizes in-person payments, while Stripe is better for online sellers.
Stripe accepts a wide variety of currencies and international payment methods and offers a fully customizable checkout experience, but it has relatively limited hardware options for point-of-sale systems. Square, on the other hand, offers specialized software and point-of-sale hardware to support brick-and-mortar businesses’ needs.

Stripe accepts an impressive number of payment methods and currencies. Additionally, customers can make payments in their home currency, and Stripe will convert that amount into your currency for an additional transaction fee of 1% (paid by the customer).
For users who have coding experience, Stripe Elements allows you to use pre-built UI components to design your checkout flow and customize it using CSS. These elements include features like credit card autofill (similar in concept to Shop Pay) and location-responsive input fields, making checkout easy for your customers. If you have a software developer on your team, you can really take advantage of Stripe’s make-it-your-own features using its open API.

If you don’t know how to code, Stripe may feel overwhelming. In particular, you might find it easiest to work with one of Stripe’s third-party partners, such as WooCommerce or Squarespace, to build your website.
Stripe doesn’t offer a free website builder like Square does, so you’ll need to build your own website, either on your own or using one of Stripe’s third-party partners.
Square’s POS options range from a quarter-size card reader that you can use alongside your cell phone to a large register with two touchscreens. This allows businesses to accept payments almost anywhere: You can set up a traditional checkout counter, restaurant customers can pay at their table and retailers can swipe cards at pop-up events or while making deliveries.
Square offers valuable features for both retailers and restaurants. In both industries, you can pay an additional $60 per month for Square Plus, which comes with advanced features and slightly lower pricing for in-person transactions (2.5% plus 10 cents).
Create a menu that hosts and servers can use to input orders for in-person dining or takeout.
Remove items from the menu when you run out for the day.
In Plus, create a floor plan of the restaurant and use it to track where people are sitting.
In Plus, automatically add gratuity to checks for large parties.
Square lets users set up an e-commerce website for free without knowing any code. For $12 a month, you can add a custom domain. Restaurants can accept online orders for pickup or delivery or create a QR code for in-person ordering. If you already have a website, you can embed Square’s Online Checkout to take payments..
Square’s payment methods are more limited than Stripe’s are. Square can process most domestic and international Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, JCB or UnionPay cards. But some coding knowledge is required to accept digital wallets online, and you can’t charge your customers in other currencies.
You may need to pay a subscription fee to access special features. And Square notes that its pricing is meant for businesses with an average ticket size of less than $15 and less than $250,000 per year in receipts. If you process larger transactions or have more revenue than that, you could pay a different rate via custom pricing.
For businesses that make most of their sales online, Stripe is likely the better choice. It also handles international transactions with ease, and every business can make the checkout flow their own. E-commerce businesses may also want to compare Stripe vs. Paypal, as the latter offers a simpler setup compared to Stripe.
For mostly in-person businesses, however, Square comes out ahead. If credit and debit cards and digital wallets are sufficient for your business’s in-person transactions, you may not need Stripe’s huge library of payment methods. And Square’s software features for retailers and restaurants set it apart: You can manage tables or inventory from the same dashboard you use to track your sales revenue.

**Square and Stripe: A Comparison of Two Popular Payment Processing Services**

Many or all of the products featured here are from our partners who compensate us. This influences which products we write about and where and how the product appears on a page. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money.

When it comes to payment processing, small and growing businesses have a plethora of options to choose from. Two of the most popular services are Square and Stripe, both of which have disrupted the traditional payment processing industry with their simple, fixed-rate fees. But how do these services compare, and which one is best for your business?

**Square: A Focus on In-Person Payments**

Square, founded in 2009, has become a go-to for mobile and brick-and-mortar businesses alike. Its physical Square Stand, released in 2013, transforms iPads into traditional cash registers, making it easy to process payments in person. The company's software suite has also expanded to handle diverse product sales, inventory management, appointment management, analytics, invoicing, online ordering, gift cards, and capital management tools.

Square's payment processing fees are competitive, with a flat rate of 2.6% plus $0.10 per transaction. And, unlike traditional payment processing companies, Square doesn't charge monthly service fees, only charging business owners when a payment is processed.

**Stripe: A Focus on Online Payments**

Stripe, founded in 2010, has made a name for itself as a leader in online payment processing. Its API makes it easy to integrate a variety of online payment processing tools and plugins, making it a popular choice for businesses that operate primarily online. With a flat rate of 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction, Stripe's fees are slightly higher than Square's, but still competitive.

**A Comparison of Fees and Services**

Both Square and Stripe offer similar services, including automated direct deposits within a few days of processing each transaction. However, there are some key differences in their fees and focus areas. Square's fees are slightly lower, but Stripe's online-focused services may be more appealing to businesses that operate primarily online.

**The Impact on the Payment Processing Industry**

Both Square and Stripe have disrupted the traditional payment processing industry, which has long been dominated by large banks. By offering simple, fixed-rate fees and eliminating monthly merchant account fees, these companies have made it easier for small and growing businesses to access credit and debit customers.

**The Future of Payment Processing**

As these companies continue to innovate and add new products, such as loans, consumers and business owners can expect further changes that will make payment processing easier and more accessible. And, as cash becomes less prevalent and consumers continue to shift towards plastic, these electronic payment processing companies can be expected to grow, with more competitors likely to enter the space.

**The Bottom Line**

Square and Stripe are both popular payment processing services, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. For businesses that operate primarily in person, Square may be the better choice. But for online-only businesses, Stripe's online-focused services may be more appealing. Ultimately, the choice between Square and Stripe will depend on the specific needs of your business.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of NerdWallet:

**Square vs. Stripe: A Comprehensive Comparison for Small Businesses**

As the payment processing industry continues to evolve, Square and Stripe have emerged as two popular options for small and growing businesses. While both companies offer simple, fixed-rate payment processing fees, they cater to different business needs. In this comparison, we'll delve into the features, fees, and benefits of Square and Stripe to help you make an informed decision.

**Square: Ideal for In-Person Transactions**

Square has become a household name, especially among mobile and brick-and-mortar businesses. Its physical Square Stand, released in 2013, transforms iPads into traditional cash registers. The company has also built out its software suite to handle diverse product sales, inventory management, appointment management, analytics, invoicing, online ordering, gift cards, and capital management tools. Although some users have reported system freezing issues, Square remains a popular choice for businesses that need to process payments on the go.

**Stripe: Perfect for Online Transactions**

Founded in 2010 by two Irish entrepreneurs, Stripe is designed specifically for online payment processing. With a flat rate of 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction, Stripe offers discounts for high-volume clients. Like Square, Stripe doesn't have monthly service fees and only charges businesses when a payment is processed. The company's API makes it easy to integrate various online payment processing tools and plugins, making it an ideal choice for businesses that operate primarily online.

**Comparing Fees and Features**

Both Square and Stripe offer similar, automated direct deposits within a few days of processing each transaction. However, Square's fees are slightly lower, at 2.6% plus $0.10 per transaction. This difference in fees relates to the difference in products, with online payments carrying a greater risk of fraud than in-person transactions.

**Target Audience**

Both Square and Stripe target businesses that want to avoid monthly transaction fees and don't want to be burdened with expensive payment processing equipment or complex contracts. While Square focuses on in-person, on-the-go transactions, Stripe is designed specifically for online payment processing.

**Disrupting Traditional Payment Processing**

Square and Stripe are major disruptors in the traditional payment processing space, which has long been dominated by large banks. By overturning traditional monthly merchant account fees and transaction fees, these companies have made it possible for more businesses to access credit and debit customers, shifting the competitive landscape from traditional businesses to startups and growing small to medium-sized companies.

With cash becoming less prevalent and consumers shifting towards plastic en masse, electronic payment processing companies like Square and Stripe are likely to grow, and more competitors are likely to enter the space.

**Conclusion**

For online-only businesses, Stripe may be a better choice due to its focus on internet payment processing. However, Square is the best option for businesses that need to process payments on the go. By understanding the differences in fees, features, and target audiences, you can make an informed decision and choose the payment processing service that best fits your business needs.","Here is the final JSON style guide for NerdWallet:

Retirement is now — and has been — a hot financial planning topic. This is especially true in recent years with the rise of the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, which emphasizes saving and investing early and often. Simply put, people are continuously interested in saving enough money from formal employment to be able to call it quits forever.
Funding emergency reserves is another very popular goal. Ideally, an emergency fund is a pile of cash with six to 12 months' of living expenses, depending on the number of earners in your household and your overall net worth. But the size of an emergency fund will vary greatly. People with a high net worth and a very simple lifestyle may only need a few months' worth of expenses set aside in cash, while families dependent on a single earner may want a larger cushion.
Starting a family is also a common goal that many people plan for from a financial perspective. Expenses might include the cost of setting up a nursery, arranging child care, and buying child-related gear. Depending on your specific family dynamic — and the level of help you can expect from parents and in-laws — these expenses can vary widely.
College funding — through 529 plans and other vehicles — is another major long-term goal that many young families have. While there are grants and other forms of aid available to many students, parents are generally expected to cover a significant portion of education costs. If your children ultimately want a professional career, you'll need to plan for college costs well in advance.
Finally, some people save and invest money for big life events, such as a wedding or lengthy vacation. Not everyone will have the same goals, and not everyone follows the same life trajectory, so there is truly no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to finding a long-term reason to invest.
It's not groundbreaking, but it bears mentioning: People want to grow their money through investing. Moreover, they want to increase it beyond the impact of inflation so they increase their purchasing power over time.
While this might seem obvious as an investment goal, growth is most likely to be an objective when the investor has a lengthy time horizon. As we constantly see, markets fluctuate in a random fashion. People with very short investment time horizons may want to focus on other priorities instead of putting too much money at risk.
Beyond increasing their money to its highest point, people who are approaching or in retirement also focus on wealth preservation. Preservation can certainly be as important as growth, depending on a number of factors: your estimated time to retirement, your overall net worth, as well as your money mindset. Even if you have the ability to take additional risk with the hope of increasing your money even more, you might sleep better at night knowing you have a certain amount locked in.
Cash flow is the bedrock of any sound financial plan. More cash flow means a greater ability to save, invest, and pay down debt.
Optimizing for cash flow might include taking on a side gig, investing in high-dividend-yielding stocks, or putting just enough in a 401(k) to get the company match, leaving more cash available to you now to fund other goals. Cash available generally means more flexibility, adaptability, and psychological safety — three things most of us are better off with than without.
Some people are happy with the material goods they have, while others strive for bigger and better. The good news is that both are entirely acceptable.
You might focus on covering your immediate expenses to fund larger goals down the line, or you might spend more now to improve your lifestyle going forward. Your mileage varies substantially here, so what this ultimately looks like is a personal preference.
One of the best ways to achieve investing success is to set up a framework for action. This is sometimes referred to as a ""workflow,"" but generally it refers to your process around saving and investing. Without specific goals and objectives — like those described in steps one and two — the workflow will be more difficult to implement.
A written document can go a very long way in spurring action and creating a mental framework concerning money. Short-term goals might include reducing your debt load or starting an emergency fund, while longer-term goals might include retirement planning and/or college funding. Regardless of your specific goals, it's good practice to have them down on paper.
Here at The Motley Fool, we're committed to a philosophy of long-term investing. This means avoiding day trading and other short-term trends in favor of buying great companies or indexes and holding them for the long term. Buy-and-hold investing tends to produce robust returns over time and affords the investor an array of tax benefits.
You'll need to check in with yourself at regular intervals — say, once a quarter or twice a year — to ensure that you're making progress. You don't need to beat yourself up if you don't make as much progress as you would have liked. Focus instead on making any progress at all. The completion of small, achievable goals can go a long way over time, so don't be too hard on yourself if you aren't immediately successful.
Some funds are needed immediately — for example, if you're paying down high-interest credit card debt — and other funds are needed many decades in the future. This is completely normal, so give yourself time to prioritize those goals that are most important to you and those that will have the greatest positive impact on your net worth.
With longer-term goals such as retirement, it's imperative that you start sooner rather than later, even if it's with a small amount of money. The power of compound earnings will intensify over time, so by starting small today, you'll have money working in the background for years to come.
By pinpointing when you'll need the money, you can figure out how much you need to save every year to ultimately achieve your funding goals. For retirement, the answer to this tends to be ""as much as possible."" But for more finite goals such as education planning, you can reverse-engineer the amount you need to save if you start at the birth of a child or at another year in the future.
A major takeaway from the conversation about investing workflow is that everyone has different variables — different desires for retirement, different family structures, and different lifestyle costs. You'll need to evaluate your own situation using a collection of information and then decide what works best for you. A plan that's adaptable and flexible will usually be better than a plan that has high costs to change or can't be changed at all.

Setting goals may feel daunting, especially when you're just starting to invest. This is the reality of large financial goals: They're difficult to achieve. But they're also very much attainable with steady and constant attention, as well as some form of accountability on the part of the investor.
That's why it's important to define realistic goals, assign a strategy for each goal, and continuously monitor your progress. With the right amount of understanding and perseverance, you'll find that most investing goals are achievable.

Our relationship with money starts at an early age when we notice family members exchanging coins or bills for all sorts of stuff we like. Money's power and authority grow when we get our first allowance or paid chore. These early experiences foster habits and beliefs that last throughout your life. Its challenges multiply as we approach adulthood and are encouraged to take loans to pay for college or buy a car.
Parental figures set the tone for investment goals early in life, teaching us to delay gratification until we can break the piggy bank, allowing those coins to buy video games, clothes or equipment. The intimate connection between investment and lifestyle grows more sophisticated as the years pass. The culmination of your working life is either a comfortable retirement – or a struggle to make ends meet.
Investment goals spread into three branches, depending on age, income and outlook. Age can be further sub-divided into three distinct segments: young and starting out, middle aged and family building and old and self-directed. These classifications often miss their marks at the appropriate age, with middle-agers looking at investments for the first time or old folks forced to rigorously budget, exercising the discipline they lacked as young adults.
Income provides the natural starting point for investment goals because you can’t invest what you don’t have. The first career job issues a wake-up call for many young people, forcing decisions about 401(k) contributions, savings or money market accounts and lifestyle changes needed to balance growing affluence with delayed gratification. It’s common to experience setbacks during this period, getting stuck in overpriced home rental and car payments or forgetting that your guardians are no longer picking up the monthly credit card bill.

Outlook describes the playing field on which we operate during our lifetimes and the choices we make that impact wealth management. Family planning resides at the top of the list for most people, with couples deciding how many kids they want, their preferred neighborhoods and how many wage earners will be needed to match those goals. Career expectations dovetail into these calculations, with the highly educated ramping into years of increased earnings power while others are stuck in dead end jobs, forced to cut back to make ends meet.
Investment goals become moving targets for many individuals, with carefully laid-out plans running into roadblocks in the form of layoffs, unplanned pregnancies, health issues and the need to care for aging parents. Those unexpected challenges demand a dose of realism when choosing 401(k) allocations or deciding how to spend a year-end bonus, with the old axiom “saving for a rainy day” ignored by many folks until it’s too late.
Fortunately, it’s never too late to become an investor. You may be in your 40s before realizing that life is moving more quickly than expected, requiring contemplation about retirement. Fear can dominate your thinking if you wait this long to set investment goals, but that‘s OK if it adds a sense of urgency to wealth management. All investments start with the first dollar set aside for that purpose, whatever your age, income, or outlook. Of course, those investing for decades hold a major advantage, while their growing wealth allows them to enjoy the fruits of their saving habits.
Investment goals address three major themes regarding money and money management. First, they intersect with a life plan that engages our thought processes in unexpected ways. Second, they generate accountability, forcing us to review progress on a periodic basis, invoking discipline when needed to stay on track. Third, they generate motivation that impacts our non-financial selves in positive ways that can improve health and mental outlook.
Once established, the investment plan forces you to think about sacrifices that need to be made and budgets that need to be balanced, understanding that delay or failure will have a direct and immediate impact on your wealth and lifestyle. This process induces long-range thinking and planning, allowing you to abandon a hand-to-mouth approach and set a priority list for the things in life you truly value.
Use monthly or quarterly statements to review progress and recommit to your chosen life plan, making small adjustments rather than big changes when money flow improves or deteriorates. Review your annual returns periodically, and enjoy seeing your wealth grow without direct intervention or a holiday check from a relative. Learn to deal with losing periods in a mature manner, using the red ink to build patience while reexamining how your decision-making may have impacted those negative returns.
Start by writing a document or journal that lists each investment goal and how you’ll measure progress. List as much detail as possible, considering both short-term and long-term objectives. Let's say you want to save for retirement but also plan to own a home in a safe neighborhood, with enough cash left over for an occasional vacation. Now review your current financial situation, noting how well you’ve handled money to this point and the steps you’re willing to take to achieve that list of goals.
It may be premature to consider the practical actions required or time frames needed to mark progress if your investment goals are unrealistic, outlandish or don’t match your current or expected earnings power. You can dream about fulfilling life’s desires, but investment planning requires a brutal reality check before executing the needed action plan. Simply stated, if the plan doesn’t match your reality or your goals, throw it away and start over. Concentrate on baby steps rather than broad-brush daydreams.
A small 401(k) contribution may be all that’s needed to get the investment plan on track during its infancy. Employers sometimes match your contribution to a certain level, which allows you to eventually think about more sophisticated planning. Financial advisors recommend you allocate the maximum allowed whenever possible although that’s unrealistic for many young people just starting out in their careers. This is especially true with the enormous burden of student loans incurred by people born after 1990.
Break investment goals into short-, intermediate- and long-term segments whenever possible, matching the natural life stages of youth, middle age and post-retirement years. Aligning bank and brokerage accounts to short and intermediate terms also makes sense while retirement accounts focus exclusively on the long term (stiff penalties are incurred when accessing those funds prematurely). In fact, there’s no good reason to tap into IRAs, SEP and other retirement accounts unless dire circumstances offer no viable alternatives.
Short- and intermediate-term goals assist SMART planning as well, allowing a quick review to gauge savings progress for a home, automobile, vacation, or family obligations. Intermediate term planning can also include a more generalized account, denoting the capital set aside for the inevitable “rainy day.” This emergency fund allocation can also serve as a firewall between life’s surprises and the much larger retirement account, allowing that capital to be left untouched, set to fulfill its intended purpose.
Don’t despair if you’ve reached middle age without investment planning because major benefits accrue quickly when the task is first engaged. Of course, playing catch-up will be required if your finances are flashing red ink, necessitating lifestyle changes until your income matches or exceeds expenses. Debt management will be needed to get on the right track because it makes no sense to earn 5% or 10% annually in an investment account when multiple credit cards have hit their limits at 18%, 20%, or 25% interest rates.
Learning to invest in middle age has the benefit of experience – that is, you can more accurately gauge your future earnings power by examining the household’s current career trajectories. It’s often possible for high-wage earners to play catch-up, building investment wealth quickly in these circumstances, but it’s still likely to require sacrifices. Sadly, income often stagnates through middle age, with dead-end jobs and stymied careers keeping some lucky family finances above water but preventing the building of more substantial savings.
Whenever possible, retirement accounts should be fully funded through middle age and right up to the end of employment even when it forces other lifestyle changes. Financial burdens are likely to increase over time, due to rising healthcare and child-rearing costs (which may include college tuition). Entering retirement with little more than government checks in hand can produce well-founded anxiety, especially when one spouse has been dependent on the other for decades, and should be avoided at all costs.
More folks are working past retirement age now than at any time in the past century. However, government rules require that investors start to withdraw funds from retirement accounts (other than Roth IRAs) at age 70½.2 Along with longer life expectancies, this requirement adds new significance to investment planning in the retirement years. It makes perfect sense for people over the age of 70 to continue their wealth building through work or investment right up to death whenever possible, especially if a spouse will rely on the funds.
Financial advisors use different metrics to calculate retirement needs. Many suggest clients accumulate enough savings during their working lives to replace 70-85% of pre-retirement income. Some even recommend 100% or more to generate the capital needed to pursue a hobby or travel. These common approaches may be outdated, given the explosion of baby boomers remaining in the work force after age 65 or 66, often taking pay cuts.
Fidelity Investments recommends saving at least 1x your pre-retirement income at age 30, 3x at 40, 7x at 55 and 10x at 67. If you think you'll need $100,000 per year after you retire, you should have $100,000 in savings at age 30, $300,000 at age 40, and so on. These recommendations assume that clients will save 15% of their annual income every year starting at age 25, with more than 50% of those savings allocated to equities.3 Realistically, many young people don’t have that level of disposable income at age 25 due to student loan commitments or internships, which means a higher annual commitment will be required at a later starting date.
Retirement planning may be hard for young people to accomplish, but it’s relatively easy to visualize the post-work years with a self-examination that considers their expected lifestyle and how they might want to spend their life savings. The Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) makes that introspective task easier with its Consumption Activities and Mail Survey (CAMS), outlining how Americans over the age of 70 spend their money and how those allocations change through the senior years.
Housing costs exceeded all other categories by a wide margin, holding at 31-36% across all age groups. Not surprisingly, healthcare costs start out relatively small – 7% at age 45 – and more than double to 15.5% at ages 75 and up. Taken together, it’s expected you’ll eventually spend more than 50% of your retirement dollars just staying alive and keeping a roof over your head.4 Now imagine how difficult it is to meet those simple needs if income is limited to a monthly Social Security check. Unfortunately, millions of Americans now face that life-sobering challenge because they could not set and address their investment goals earlier in life.
These numbers are especially troubling because, as the study notes, men and women participate in 401(k) plans at the same 79% rate, but women set aside an average 7.5% of their salary while men allocate an average 8.7%, a deficit made worse by women's lower average earning power. In 2015, 401(k) balances for women were just 59% of the men’s total – $71,060 versus $119,150.5 While the authors suggest plan changes to encourage higher saving rates, this disparity is likely to continue as long as the workplace gender gap in pay remains.
This is a remarkable finding, directly applicable to achieving investment goals and objectives, offering a perfect path for individuals lacking discipline or willpower to overcome those deficits in a life-changing way. Age diversity among participants also tells us it’s never too late to achieve realistic investment goals as long as we’re willing to go the extra mile, writing them in detail and reporting our progress to a helpful third party.
Of course, even disciplined individuals may find it hard to stay on financial track when life throws a hardball in their direction. Job loss, divorce, sickness, discrimination, or other headwinds can set life on an unexpected course that negatively impacts earnings and savings power. Volatility can also take its toll on the financial markets and your savings, as they did in 2007 and 2008 when American investors lost trillions of dollars in their retirement accounts.
Bear markets and crashes may be inevitable over the decades between your first contribution and retirement age, despite statistics that confirm impressive long-term equity returns. Many investors don’t have the stomach for those volatile periods, often ignoring sound advice and dumping long-term positions at bargain-basement prices. It’s easy to tell ourselves we’ll stand firm when the next crisis comes long, but you won’t know for sure until it happens.
Two incomes make saving for a home and qualifying for a mortgage much easier goals to accomplish. Cooperation between partners is vital when engaged in this intermediate term planning because goals need agreement and coordination to avoid major complications. One spouse tapping credit card limits while the other diligently allocates weekly income into savings can generate a major roadblock to long-term prosperity.
Partnership can also ease the housing burden for those ages 45 and up, when 31-36% retirement income is allocated to rent, mortgage payments, insurance, property taxes and maintenance.4 The savings from pooled income can be significant in multi-person households, freeing up capital for other outlays. Conversely, physical disparities between spouses or partners may complicate healthcare expenses, with a major illness or institutional care overcoming Medicare coverage, creating hardship for the other partner.
Figure out your investment goals as early in life as possible because waiting too long introduces complications that may be difficult or impossible to overcome. Planning and execution requires a level of discipline and commitment that makes many folks uncomfortable, often requiring major life changes to be successful. Start small if the process feels overwhelming, with minimum 401(k) contributions that let you watch a small nest egg grow quickly.
Raise the contribution to the maximum as soon as possible and take the next step, developing realistic short- and intermediate-term investment goals for the disposable income accumulating in a checking or savings account. Remember this is a lifetime pursuit that demands careful planning at each stage, but the payoff can be great, offering a potentially reliable path to prosperity.

**Setting Financial Goals: A Key to Achieving Long-Term Success**

Creating a plan for future financial goals is a crucial concern for individuals of all ages. In this article, we will identify some common financial planning objectives, explore strategies for achieving them, and offer suggestions for establishing an effective investing workflow.

**Retirement Planning: A Top Priority**

Retirement planning has been a hot topic in recent years, particularly with the rise of the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement. This movement emphasizes the importance of saving and investing early and often to achieve financial independence. Simply put, people want to accumulate enough wealth to support themselves in retirement and live comfortably without the need for a steady paycheck.

**Funding Emergency Reserves: A Necessity**

Building an emergency fund is another essential financial goal. Ideally, an emergency fund should cover six to 12 months of living expenses, depending on the number of earners in the household and overall net worth. The size of the emergency fund may vary greatly, with individuals with a high net worth and a simple lifestyle requiring a smaller cushion, while families dependent on a single earner may need a larger safety net.

**Starting a Family: A Major Financial Milestone**

Starting a family is a significant financial goal that many people plan for. Expenses associated with raising a family may include setting up a nursery, arranging childcare, and buying child-related gear. The cost of these expenses can vary widely, depending on the individual's family dynamics and the level of support expected from parents and in-laws.

**College Funding: A Long-Term Priority**

College funding is another major long-term goal that many young families aim to achieve. While grants and other forms of financial aid are available to many students, parents are generally expected to cover a significant portion of education costs. To plan for college costs, individuals must start saving and investing early to ensure they have sufficient funds to support their children's education.

**Saving for Big Life Events: A Personal Goal**

Some people save and invest for big life events, such as a wedding or a lengthy vacation. While not everyone will have the same goals, it's essential to identify a personal reason for investing and saving.

**Growing Your Wealth: A Primary Investment Objective**

Growing one's wealth is a fundamental investment objective. People want to increase their wealth beyond the impact of inflation to maintain their purchasing power over time. This goal is more likely to be achieved when the investor has a lengthy time horizon, as markets can fluctuate randomly. Individuals with a short investment time horizon may want to focus on other priorities instead of risking their capital.

**Wealth Preservation: A Crucial Consideration**

Wealth preservation is another essential investment objective, particularly for individuals approaching or in retirement. Preservation can be as important as growth, depending on factors such as estimated time to retirement, overall net worth, and money mindset. Even if individuals have the ability to take additional risk to increase their wealth, they may prefer to prioritize wealth preservation to ensure a certain level of security.

**Cash Flow: The Foundation of a Sound Financial Plan**

Cash flow is the bedrock of any sound financial plan. A greater ability to save, invest, and pay down debt requires a sufficient cash flow. Optimizing cash flow may involve taking on a side gig, investing in high-dividend-yielding stocks, or contributing enough to a 401(k) to receive the company match, leaving more cash available for other goals.

**Creating a Framework for Action: A Key to Investing Success**

One of the best ways to achieve investing success is to establish a framework for action, often referred to as a ""workflow."" This framework helps individuals set specific goals and objectives, prioritize their goals, and create a plan to achieve them. A written document can go a long way in spurring action and creating a mental framework for managing money.

**Setting Realistic Goals and Monitoring Progress**

Setting realistic goals, assigning a strategy for each goal, and continuously monitoring progress are essential to achieving investing success. It's crucial to define achievable goals, prioritize them, and track progress to ensure that individuals are on track to meet their financial objectives.

Retirement planning, for instance, is a pressing concern for many, particularly with the rise of the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement, which emphasizes the importance of saving and investing early and often. The ultimate goal is to accumulate sufficient wealth to sustain oneself in retirement, free from the burden of formal employment.

Building an emergency fund is another critical financial planning objective. Ideally, this fund should cover six to 12 months' worth of living expenses, depending on the number of earners in the household and overall net worth.

Growth and wealth preservation are two fundamental investment objectives. Growth is often a priority for those with a lengthy time horizon, as it allows them to increase their purchasing power over time. Preservation, on the other hand, is critical for those approaching or in retirement, as it ensures they have a certain amount of wealth locked in.

Cash flow is another essential component of a sound financial plan, enabling individuals to save, invest, and pay down debt. Optimizing cash flow may involve taking on a side gig, investing in high-dividend-yielding stocks, or contributing to a 401(k) to secure the company match.

This involves setting specific goals, assigning strategies for each goal, and continuously monitoring progress. With the right mindset and perseverance, most investing goals are achievable.

One of the most critical aspects of investing is defining realistic goals and assigning strategies for each goal. It's essential to have a written document outlining one's goals, as this can spur action and create a mental framework for making investment decisions. Short-term goals might include reducing debt or building an emergency fund, while longer-term goals might include retirement planning and college funding.

By setting clear goals and establishing a workflow, individuals can create a roadmap for achieving their financial objectives. This involves checking in regularly to ensure progress, making adjustments as needed, and focusing on small, achievable goals. With time and discipline, anyone can create a successful investment strategy tailored to their unique needs and priorities.

In conclusion, creating a plan for achieving long-term financial goals is a critical component of a sound financial strategy. By identifying one's goals, assigning strategies for each goal, and establishing a workflow, individuals can set themselves on a path to financial success.","Here is the comprehensive style guide in valid JSON format, organized into a clear hierarchy, making it easy for LLMs to parse and reference:

You could save money by using a home equity loan to pay off a credit card balance.
If you're sitting on credit card debt, you may be eager to pay it off as quickly as possible. The longer you carry a credit card balance, the more interest you're apt to accrue. And that interest could get expensive.
In fact, if you own a home and have a lot of equity in it, you may be thinking of taking out a home equity loan and using it to pay off your credit card balance. But is that a smart move?
Home equity refers to the portion of your home you own outright. It's calculated by taking the market value of your home and subtracting your mortgage balance.
Alert: highest cash back card we’ve seen now has 0% intro APR for 15 months. Learn more here.
If you have equity in your home, you can generally take out a loan against it, and that loan will be secured by your home itself. So, let's say your home is worth $300,000 and you owe $200,000 on your mortgage. That leaves you with $100,000 of equity.
If you owe $10,000 on your credit cards, you might easily qualify for a $10,000 home equity loan based on the equity you have. In that case, you'd use your loan proceeds to pay off your credit cards and then pay off your home equity loan in equal monthly installments.
The interest you'll be charged on a home equity loan will generally be much lower than the interest rate you're paying on your credit card balances. That's why using a home equity loan to pay off credit card debt makes sense. If your credit cards are charging you an average of 15% interest but you qualify for a home equity loan at 7% interest, that's a big difference.
Also, credit card interest can be variable and your rate can rise over time. Home equity loans commonly come with fixed interest rates. That not only makes your monthly payments predictable, but helps ensure your loan doesn't end up costing more than necessary.
A home equity loan is a secured loan, which means it's tied to a specific asset -- your home itself. If you fall far enough behind on your home equity loan payments, you could end up losing your home.
By contrast, credit card balances aren't secured by a specific asset. If you fall behind on making your minimum credit card payments, there will be consequences, like seeing your credit score take a massive hit and being unable to borrow money because of that. But falling behind on your credit card bills won't put you at risk of losing your home.
Another thing you should know is you might pay closing costs on a home equity loan. The amount of those fees can vary from lender to lender, but it's another expense you might incur in the course of making your credit card debt less expensive to pay off.
A home equity loan could make your credit card debt easier to pay off, but if you're going to go this route, make sure you understand the risks involved. Also, make sure the payment plan you sign up for is one you can afford. If you're able to keep your home equity loan payments to a manageable level, you can knock out your credit card debt more affordably without putting yourself in danger of losing the roof over your head.
This credit card is not just good – it's so exceptional that our experts use it personally. It features a 0% intro APR for 15 months, a cash back rate of up to 5%, and all somehow for no annual fee!

It could take years—if not decades—to bring your cards back down to zero if you're only able to make minimum monthly payments. One alternative, if you own your home, is taking out a home equity loan and using the money to pay off your card debt. But before you do, you'll also want to consider the risks and some possible alternatives.
A home equity loan is a second mortgage. It allows you to borrow against the equity accumulated in your home over the years. It's based on the value of the home minus whatever is owed on your mortgage. For example, if you own a home that's currently worth $300,000 and you owe $200,000 on your mortgage, you have $100,000 in equity.
Based on that, a bank, credit union, or other lender may be willing to issue a home equity loan equal to some percentage of your equity. You would need to apply for a home equity loan through the lender of your choice before anything else. How much you can borrow and whether you can get a loan at all will also be affected by other factors, such as your credit score.
Most lenders require borrowers to have some form of income, a credit score of 600 or more, and equity of at least 15% to 20% of the value of their home.1 You may qualify even if you don't meet these requirements but you will likely end up with a higher interest rate.
Unlike a refinance, this type of loan does not get factored into your mortgage. This means that you're taking on additional debt on top of your mortgage. As such, you will be required to make your monthly mortgage payment as well as the one to your home equity loan.
Many people take home equity loans to do repairs and renovations on their homes.
If you use a home equity loan to pay off multiple credit cards, it will also simplify your life, giving you just one bill to deal with each month instead of several.
The major downside to taking out a home equity loan, whether that's to pay off debt or for any other purpose, is that you'll be putting your home on the line. Because your home serves as collateral for the loan, just as it does for your original mortgage, the lender could seize and sell it if you are unable to pay your loan back.
When you can't repay credit card debt, you'll also face serious financial consequences, of course, especially for your credit score. But because credit card debt is not secured by your home, you'll be at far less risk of losing it. Even if you have to declare bankruptcy because of your debts, you can often keep your principal residence.
As noted above, a home equity loan adds to your debt because it is a separate loan. This means that you must continue making your mortgage payment in addition to the loan payment each month.
Some credit cards allow you to transfer your balances over from other cards. This can make sense if you're able to obtain a significantly lower interest rate on the new card.
Many balance transfer credit cards also offer promotional periods of six to 18 months for which they charge 0% interest on the transferred balance. Of course, moving a balance from one card to another won't eliminate the debt. But it can help you pay it off faster—especially if you get a really great rate.
A debt consolidation loan from a bank, credit union, or other reputable lender could provide the money you need to pay off your credit card balances. This allows you to pool together a number of different debts into one. So if you have multiple credit cards, loans, or any other outstanding debts, you can get a larger loan to pay them off.
Debt consolidation loans tend to charge significantly lower interest rates than credit cards. And you also have the added benefit of making one monthly payment to a single creditor rather than many payments to different lenders.
Many 401(k) plans allow you to borrow from the money you've accumulated in your account. If your plan comes with a loan provision, you may be able to borrow as much as $50,000. What's more, the interest you pay on the loan goes back into your account. Loans from a 401(k) do have a few caveats.
Keep in mind that you should only use this as a last resort. For one thing, the money you've pooled is intended for your retirement and should be kept for that purpose. If you withdraw the money, you'll lose out on compounding.
If you must use it, remember that the loan generally needs to be repaid within five years, or sooner if you leave your job. For another, if you're unable to repay the loan, it will be treated as a withdrawal, subjecting you to income taxes and a possible 10% penalty on the unpaid balance.
The process of getting a home equity loan from application to approval depends on a few factors. In general, it can take anywhere from a couple of weeks to a few months. The process could go smoothly and quickly if you're prepared with all the required paperwork. But there may be certain holdups that are beyond your control, including the underwriting process, the timing of the appraisal, and the closing.
This depends on your personal and financial situation because a home equity loan is completely different from refinancing. A home equity loan is an additional loan on top of your existing mortgage. This means if you're approved for the loan, you have to make both payments each month. The loan does give you additional cash to do whatever you wish, whether you want to renovate or pay off other debts. Refinancing, on the other hand, means you restructure the original mortgage debt with new terms. In some cases, you may be able to refinance and add the value of additional equity into your new loan.
Home equity loans can be used for any purpose. If you meet your lender's requirements and are approved, you can use the money to make improvements or repairs to your home, pay off other debt, or pay for other expenses. Keep in mind that you must make your monthly mortgage payment in addition to the one for your loan.
A home equity loan can be a good way to pay off high-interest credit card debt as long as everything goes according to plan. In deciding whether it's a viable option, consider how strong—or precarious—your financial situation currently is. If you have a secure job (and/or a spouse with one) and are confident that you'll have no trouble keeping up with the payments, it could make sense. However, if your job is on shaky ground and you have no other financial resources to draw on if you lose it, a home equity loan could be a risky proposition. Remember, it can also cost you your home in the worst-case scenario.

Using a Home Equity Loan to Pay Off Credit Card Debt: Is It a Smart Move?

If you're struggling to pay off credit card debt, you may be considering unconventional methods to eliminate your balance. One option some homeowners are exploring is using a home equity loan to pay off their credit card debt. But is this strategy wise?

Home equity refers to the portion of your home's value that you own outright, calculated by subtracting your mortgage balance from the market value of your property. If you have significant equity in your home, you may be eligible for a home equity loan, which can be used to pay off high-interest debt, including credit card balances.

For example, let's say your home is worth $300,000, and you owe $200,000 on your mortgage. That leaves you with $100,000 of equity. If you owe $10,000 on your credit cards, you may qualify for a $10,000 home equity loan based on the equity you have. By using the loan proceeds to pay off your credit cards, you can then focus on repaying the home equity loan in equal monthly installments.

One major advantage of using a home equity loan to pay off credit card debt is the significantly lower interest rate. While credit card interest rates can be variable and reach as high as 15%, home equity loans typically offer fixed interest rates, often around 7%. This can lead to substantial savings over time.

Moreover, credit card interest can increase over time, whereas home equity loans come with fixed rates, making your monthly payments predictable and helping ensure your loan doesn't end up costing more than necessary.

It's essential to understand, however, that a home equity loan is a secured loan, tied to a specific asset – your home. If you fall behind on your home equity loan payments, you risk losing your home. By contrast, credit card debt is unsecured, meaning that while missing payments will have negative consequences, such as damaging your credit score, it won't put your home at risk.

Another consideration is the potential closing costs associated with a home equity loan, which can vary by lender. These fees should be factored into your decision, as they may affect the overall cost-effectiveness of using a home equity loan to pay off credit card debt.

In conclusion, using a home equity loan to pay off credit card debt can be a viable strategy, but it's crucial to understand the risks involved and ensure the payment plan is manageable. By doing so, you can eliminate your credit card debt more affordably without putting yourself in danger of losing your home.

**Paying Off Credit Card Debt with a Home Equity Loan: Is It a Smart Move?**

If you're struggling with credit card debt, you may be considering using a home equity loan to pay off your balances. But is this strategy a wise decision, or could it lead to more financial trouble down the line?

**The Benefits of Using a Home Equity Loan**

One of the primary advantages of using a home equity loan to pay off credit card debt is the lower interest rate. Home equity loans typically offer fixed interest rates, which can be significantly lower than the variable rates charged by credit card companies. For example, if you're paying 15% interest on your credit card balances, you may be able to secure a home equity loan with a 7% interest rate. This difference in interest rates can add up to significant savings over time.

Another benefit of using a home equity loan is the predictability of your monthly payments. With a fixed interest rate and a set loan term, you'll know exactly how much you'll need to pay each month to pay off your debt. This can be a welcome change from the uncertainty of credit card payments, which can fluctuate based on your outstanding balance and interest rate.

**The Risks of Using a Home Equity Loan**

While using a home equity loan to pay off credit card debt can be a smart move, it's essential to understand the risks involved. One of the most significant risks is that you're securing the loan with your home, which means that if you're unable to make your payments, you could lose your property. This is in contrast to credit card debt, which is unsecured and doesn't put your home at risk.

Another risk to consider is the possibility of accumulating more debt. If you use a home equity loan to pay off your credit card balances, you'll need to be disciplined enough to avoid running up new charges on your credit cards. Otherwise, you could find yourself in an even deeper hole than before.

**Closing Costs and Other Expenses**

In addition to the risks involved, you'll also need to consider the closing costs associated with a home equity loan. These costs can vary from lender to lender, but they typically include fees for appraisals, title insurance, and loan origination. You'll need to factor these costs into your decision to ensure that using a home equity loan is still a cost-effective strategy for paying off your debt.

**The Bottom Line**

Using a home equity loan to pay off credit card debt can be a smart move, but it's essential to carefully consider the risks and benefits involved. By understanding the pros and cons of this strategy, you can make an informed decision that's right for your financial situation.

0.677777777777778,"A credit privacy number (CPN) is marketed to people with low credit scores as a supposed replacement for a Social Security number — It’s illegal and often part of credit repair scams.
Scammers present credit privacy numbers (CPNs), sometimes called credit profile numbers, as an alternative to Social Security numbers. Some credit repair companies promise that CPNs can give those with poor credit histories a fresh start, while others market them as a way to protect one’s privacy and identity. While these selling points can seem tempting, it’s illegal to use a CPN. Misrepresenting your Social Security number on loan or credit applications is considered fraud and a federal crime. Many CPNs are stolen Social Security numbers, including those of children, so using one can also implicate you in identity theft.
Imagine that Sally has had a rough couple of years financially. She lost her job and went into credit card debt to make ends meet. Sally is working on rebuilding her credit, but for now her financial past prevents her from getting a credit card or loan. Sally learns about credit privacy numbers and thinks they might be a way out.
She wants to use a CPN on her credit applications so that creditors won’t learn about her financial history. Unfortunately for Sally, CPNs are a scam, and she could be breaking federal law by using them.
When you’re wearing a good costume, your mask and outfit conceal your real identity, and no one knows who you really are. Similarly, a CPN purports to mask your identity and credit history. Unfortunately, you can’t use your CPN in the real world any more than you can change your real identity by wearing a costume. And trying to do so could result in fines or jail time.

The idea that you could replace your Social Security number might sound appealing.
A low credit score can hold you back from qualifying for new credit or good interest rates. Poor credit can even keep you from landing a job or apartment in some cases. The possibility of buying a credit privacy number (CPN) to use in place of your Social Security number can sound like a fresh start.
Others might want to shield their Social Security numbers to protect themselves from identity theft. Many applications for loans, credit cards, jobs, and apartments ask for your Social Security number. It may sound tempting to use a CPN instead to avoid having your Social Security number end up in the wrong hands.
Unfortunately, CPNs are too good to be true.
So-called credit repair companies may promise you a fresh start with a credit privacy number in exchange for a fee. They may tell you this process is perfectly legal, but it’s not.
If you use a CPN on a credit card application instead of your Social Security number, you may be committing a crime. Federal law prohibits people from lying on a credit or loan application or misrepresenting their Social Security number.
What makes matters worse is that CPNS are often stolen Social Security numbers, including those of children or dead people. That means you could become involved in identity theft by using a CPN. Doing so could constitute fraud, which could lead to fines or land you in prison.
If any of these situations apply to you, you can visit an SSA office to apply for a new number. You will need to provide credible, external evidence to back up your case.
Unfortunately, getting out from under past financial problems is not one of the reasons you can get a new Social Security number.
If you’re struggling to qualify for credit or loans because of a rocky credit history, it’s understandable that you would be looking for alternatives. There’s no easy way to erase your past, but there are plenty of ways you can take control of the situation and repair your credit history.
First, make sure you pay all your bills on time. Your payment history is one of the most critical factors on your credit report, and missing even one payment can have a negative impact. The longer you make your payments on schedule, the more your credit score will increase.
Your credit utilization ratio is another major factor in determining your credit score. This ratio is the percentage of available credit that you are using. The lower your credit utilization score, the better. One way to increase your credit score may be to pay off some debt to lower that ratio.
Check your credit reports regularly to make sure all the information in them is correct. You can order a free report once a year from each of the three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. If anything looks amiss, you can dispute the error.
Improving your credit takes time. The longer you go without negative marks on your credit report, the more your score will increase. Even major events like bankruptcies and foreclosures won’t stay on your credit report forever.
Some people are interested in a CPN because they think it will help them avoid becoming victims of identity theft. While a CPN is not a legal option, there are other ways you can protect yourself.
One way is to avoid responding to suspicious phone calls, letters, or emails that ask for your Social Security number or other personal information. These requests may even come from the email address of someone you know if an email account is hacked.
Finally, a number of credit and identity-theft monitoring services offer to keep an eye on your credit and let you know if anything suspicious occurs using your Social Security number.
These services will flag new accounts, hard credit inquiries, public records, and more. If any activity occurs, they’ll alert you in case the activity was fraudulent. Some companies offer this as a paid service, while others offer free credit monitoring.
If you aren’t using a credit monitoring service, you can be on the lookout for identity theft yourself. Signs that someone has stolen your identity include withdrawals from your bank account, debt collectors contacting you about debt you didn’t take on, and unfamiliar accounts on your credit report.

You could unwittingly become involved in identity theft, and you could end up in prison if you fill in a form requesting your Social Security number with a CPN. Among the things you may be asked to do: Get a driver’s license with a different address, change your phone number and get a new email address. You will also be paying for the digits you may be hoping to use in place of your own Social Security number.
Requests such as those should be a giant red flag. The Federal Trade Commission has warned against companies offering a new credit identity by selling CPNs, calling it a scam.
CPNs exist in a legal gray area because the U.S. Privacy Act, a 1974 law, allows people to withhold their Social Security numbers when not required by federal law. Federal law does not require a Social Security number for credit applications. However, CPNs are not legitimate, nor are they recognized by the government, according to the Office of the Inspector General.
A Social Security number is one of several identifiers credit bureaus use to be sure they have the right person. Because other metrics, such as address and phone number are also used, sellers of CPNs generally encourage their clients to change those things so that data cannot be matched.
If you think about it, it doesn’t make sense that creditors who denied you credit under your name and credit record would reconsider if they were aware it was the same applicant, cloaked in “privacy” and with a new address and phone number.
It's tempting to hope for a quick and easy solution when you are in financial trouble. It’s only human to want to forget about skepticism and believe there’s a shortcut to credit respectability.
Be careful about any company that promises a “new credit identity”; there’s no such thing.
Don’t believe any company that asks you to apply for an Employer Identification Number just so that you can use it instead of your Social Security number. While EINs are legal — businesses use them when reporting to the IRS — they aren’t a substitute for a Social Security number.
Know your rights under the Credit Repair Organization Act, which among other protections makes it illegal for credit repair agencies to charge you before they’ve performed services.
There is not a legal way to start again with a blank slate for credit if the information in your credit reports is accurate.
But most negative information on your files is not permanent. It will drop off eventually, usually in seven years. And the more time goes by — and the more positive information in your credit report — the less impact it has on your credit scores.
If you have debt, explore all your options, including paying it off yourself, or consider debt relief methods such as bankruptcy, debt management or debt settlement.
Pay credit card bills and loans on time, every time.
Keep balances on credit cards low — try to stay below 30%, and lower is better.
Do those things consistently, over time, and your credit score will take care of itself — no gimmicks needed.

**The Credit Privacy Number Scam: A Warning to Those with Low Credit Scores**

The idea of erasing your financial past and starting anew can be tantalizing, especially for those struggling with low credit scores. But beware: credit privacy numbers (CPNs) are not a legal or safe way to escape your financial history.

CPNs are often marketed as a replacement for Social Security numbers, promising a fresh start for those with poor credit. But using a CPN is illegal and can lead to serious consequences, including fines and even jail time.

Imagine you're struggling to recover from a financial setback. You're tempted to use a CPN to wipe the slate clean and start over. But using a CPN is not a solution - it's a scam.

CPNs are often stolen Social Security numbers, including those of children or deceased individuals. When you use a CPN, you're not only committing fraud, but you may also be involved in identity theft.

So, what can you do instead? If you're struggling to repair your credit, there are legal and effective ways to improve your credit score. Start by paying all your bills on time, as payment history is a critical factor in determining your credit score. You can also work on reducing your credit utilization ratio by paying off debt and keeping credit inquiries to a minimum.

Regularly check your credit reports to ensure they're accurate and dispute any errors you find. And, be patient - improving your credit takes time, but it's worth the effort.

If you're concerned about identity theft, there are steps you can take to protect yourself. Avoid responding to suspicious requests for personal information, and consider using a credit monitoring service to keep an eye on your credit.

Remember, there's no quick fix for bad credit. But with time, effort, and patience, you can improve your credit score and achieve financial stability.

**The Dark Truth About Credit Privacy Numbers (CPNs)**

If you're struggling with a poor credit history, you may have come across the concept of a credit privacy number (CPN) as a supposed solution. But beware: CPNs are often nothing more than a scam, and using one can land you in serious legal trouble.

Scammers claim that CPNs can give you a fresh start, protecting your privacy and identity by replacing your Social Security number. But this couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, CPNs are often stolen Social Security numbers, including those of children or deceased individuals. And using one can constitute fraud, leading to fines or even jail time.

Meet Sally, who's been struggling to rebuild her credit after a rough financial patch. She thinks a CPN might be the answer to her problems, but unfortunately, she's been misled. Using a CPN on her credit applications would be illegal and could have serious consequences.

**The Myth of CPNs**

The idea of replacing your Social Security number might sound appealing, especially if you're worried about identity theft or want to escape a bad credit history. But CPNs are simply not a legal or ethical solution. In fact, misrepresenting your Social Security number on a loan or credit application is a federal crime.

Instead of turning to CPNs, there are legitimate ways to improve your credit score and protect your identity. For starters, make sure to pay all your bills on time, keep your credit utilization ratio low, and regularly check your credit reports for errors. You can also consider working with a reputable credit counselor or financial advisor to develop a personalized plan to get your finances back on track.

**Protecting Yourself from Identity Theft**

If you're concerned about identity theft, there are other ways to protect yourself without resorting to a CPN. For example, be cautious when responding to suspicious phone calls, emails, or letters that ask for your personal information. You can also consider using a credit monitoring service, which can alert you to any suspicious activity on your credit report.

Remember, there's no quick fix for a poor credit history, and no legitimate way to replace your Social Security number. By staying informed and taking the right steps, you can improve your credit score and protect your identity without resorting to illegal or unethical means.

0.634408602150538,"Railroad stocks were responsible for one of the first big investment booms in U.S. history. More than a century later, railroads remain a key part of the economy.
Over the years, the industry has consolidated down to a handful of titans responsible for moving most of the goods around the country and to and from ports. As shippers and truckers faced disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, railroads held up better than most because of their unique 24/7 business model and ability to move a lot of cargo with very few people. And, in an age where fuel efficiency is increasingly a priority, railroads are only growing in importance as the transportation solution of choice.
Transportation stocks tend to be cyclical, but rail holds up better than most in an economic downturn because rail companies are larger and better capitalized than trucking companies. Despite high oil prices leading to higher fuel bills, railroads also tend to do well when fuel costs spike because trains can transport a lot more cargo than trucks for each gallon of diesel burned.
For much of the 20th century, the railroad industry was plagued by bankruptcies. But today, thanks to years of consolidation and a recent push called ""Precision Scheduled Railroading,"" the remaining companies are able to get more out of the assets they own than ever. The changes have brought down costs throughout the industry and allowed the companies to return more cash to shareholders.
Union Pacific is one of two large railroads operating in the western half of the country, with track that connects the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach with U.S. population centers. Union Pacific has long had a reputation among investors as the best-run U.S. railroad. Over the past decade, the company has invested more than $35 billion to modernize and maintain its 32,200 miles of track.
Like most railroads, Union Pacific pays a dividend, with the stock yielding about 1.8% at the time of this writing. Over the past five years, the railroad has increased revenue at a compound annual rate of about 2.1% and has forecast continued steady growth and a dividend that equates to 45% of annual earnings.
Canadian National has only been public since the mid-1990s, but the government entity turned private company provides access to almost every corner of Canada, while also providing a shipping link to the Gulf of Mexico. The railroad has more than 22,000 route miles of track and hauls agricultural products, energy, and containers from coast to coast.
Canadian National is under new management following a 2021 proxy battle, but it has continued to pay a dividend yielding about 1.8%. The company believes it can match the 3.3% compound annualized growth rate that the railroad has produced over the past five years, thanks to track improvements, strong demand for Canadian energy assets, and the impact of a combined North American trade area.
If you're using the wrong credit or debit card, it could be costing you serious money. Our experts love this top pick, which features a 0% intro APR for 15 months, an insane cash back rate of up to 5%, and all somehow for no annual fee. In fact, this card is so good that our experts use it personally. Click here to read our full review for free and apply in just 2 minutes.
CSX is primarily focused east of the Mississippi River, with more than 20,000 miles of track and access to 70 ports. The East Coast railroads historically have been less efficient than their Canadian and western counterparts due to the more congested landscape, but CSX has made great strides in recent years in improving its operations. CSX has delivered compound annual growth of more than 15% over the past five years.
CSX officially has only existed since 1980, but it is a combination of a number of railroads that have been around since the dawn of the rail age, including the Baltimore & Ohio. The company faces the challenge of maintaining and modernizing a lot of century-old assets along the rails, but it has still generated reliable profits and a dividend that currently yields more than 1.1%.
Canadian Pacific has long been the smaller of the two major Canadian railroads, with just 14,700 miles of track and less of a reach into the U.S. That's set to change if the company's planned acquisition of Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) is cleared by regulators sometime in late 2022. The deal would give Canadian Pacific a vast network down the spine of North America to a deep-water port in Mexico, which, coupled with its existing east-west track across Canada, will allow freight to seamlessly travel around the continent.
Railroad mergers have a long history of getting off-track, and investors should tread cautiously during what is likely to be a multi-year integration process (assuming the deal is approved). But those already invested should continue to get a dividend currently yielding about 1.3%, as well as reason to hope they are on the ground floor of a new North American transportation powerhouse.
Norfolk Southern is the other eastern-focused railroad, operating more than 19,300 track miles spread across 22 states and the District of Columbia. The company is a major transporter of industrial, agriculture, and consumer products, as well as a primary source of transportation for coal and auto parts. Norfolk Southern also has an extensive intermodal network in the east that carries containers from ship hulls to truck flatbeds.
Norfolk Southern's revenue has been growing at a 12% annualized rate over the past five years and currently has a dividend yielding more than 1.7%. The company hiked its dividend twice in 2021 and also doubled its share repurchase target. In years to come, Norfolk Southern plans to return between 35% and 40% of net income to shareholders in the form of continued dividends.
There's another railroad competing against Union Pacific out West, but it is hidden inside the massive portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A  1.17%) (BRK.B  1.0%). In 2009, Berkshire Hathaway bought full control of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, giving it ownership of North America's largest railroad. BNSF, as the railroad is called, operates more than 32,500 miles of track in 28 states and three Canadian provinces.
BNSF's earnings make up only a small fraction of Berkshire Hathaway's overall revenue, and it would be unwise to buy Berkshire solely for its railroad. But for investors looking for exposure to rail in a diversified package, Berkshire Hathaway could be an attractive investment.
Moving people and things around is where these companies are at.
Exchange-traded funds composed of transportation companies can help your portfolio fly.
Industrial companies span several subsectors of the economy they support.
Infrastructure is the backbone of the economy, so these companies can help build your portfolio.
Rail can be plodding, but it does deliver. In a world where the supply chain is under pressure and fuel efficiency is king, rail with its 24/7 operating model and ability to pull hundreds of cars with only one locomotive, is well-positioned to take an ever-expanding part of the transportation pie in years to come.
These railroad companies provide a steady stream of income, reliable cash flows, and modest but sustainable revenue growth. For those looking to keep a growth-focused portfolio on the rails when tech stocks are out of favor, railroad stocks can be an attractive way to diversify.

Simply click below to lock in this deal!","We look at the top railroad stocks in three categories: the best value, the fastest growth, and the best performance. All data are as of April 13.
These are the railroad stocks with the lowest 12-month trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Because profits can be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, a low P/E ratio shows you’re paying less for each dollar of profit generated.
These are the top railroad stocks as ranked by a growth model that scores companies based on a 50/50 weighting of their most recent quarterly YOY percentage revenue growth and their most recent quarterly YOY earnings-per-share (EPS) growth. Both sales and earnings are critical factors in the success of a company.
Therefore ranking companies by only one growth metric makes a ranking susceptible to the accounting anomalies of that quarter (such as changes in tax law or restructuring costs) that may make one or the other figure unrepresentative of the business in general. Companies with quarterly EPS or revenue growth of over 1,000% were excluded as outliers.
These are the railroad stocks that had the highest total return over the last 12 months.
You should also survey the railroad's competition in the transportation sector, such as the trucking industry.
Railroad stocks can be highly volatile during weak economies or when some other sectors are under strain, because railroads and their deliveries connect many sectors of the economy. For example, if there's a shortage of timber and you invest in a railroad company that specializes in transporting timber, that company and your stock may face some losses. Also note the economic state of commodities such as coal, oil, and gas as well as precious metals like gold, silver, and cobalt when considering investing in railroad companies.
Another factor that could affect the performance of railroad stocks is political turmoil. Some people are critical of the oil and gas industry, for instance, so if countries pass laws that limit the production or exposure of oil and gas companies, the railroad companies that serve them may suffer.

Railroad Stocks: A Safe Bet in Volatile Markets

Railroad stocks have been a cornerstone of the US economy for over a century, and their importance only continues to grow. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic's disruption to global supply chains, railroads held up remarkably well, thanks to their 24/7 business model and ability to transport large volumes of cargo with minimal labor.

In an era where fuel efficiency is increasingly critical, railroads are becoming a transportation solution of choice. And, as shippers and truckers face rising costs, railroads are poised to capitalize on their comparative advantage.

Unlike other transportation stocks, railroads tend to perform better during economic downturns due to their larger size and stronger capitalization compared to trucking companies. Higher oil prices, which typically hurt transportation companies, actually benefit railroads, as they can transport more cargo per gallon of diesel burned.

The railroad industry has undergone significant consolidation in recent years, leading to increased efficiency and cost savings. The introduction of ""Precision Scheduled Railroading"" has allowed companies to get more out of their assets, resulting in higher returns for shareholders.

Union Pacific: A Leader in Western Rail

Union Pacific is one of the largest railroads in the western United States, with a vast network connecting the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to major population centers. The company has a reputation for being well-run and has invested over $35 billion in modernizing and maintaining its 32,200 miles of track over the past decade.

Union Pacific pays a dividend, currently yielding around 1.8%, and has a strong track record of revenue growth, with a compound annual growth rate of around 2.1% over the past five years. The company forecasts continued steady growth and a dividend payout equivalent to 45% of annual earnings.

Canadian National: A Dominant Force in Canadian Rail

Canadian National is a major player in Canadian rail, with over 22,000 route miles of track and a presence in almost every corner of the country. The company has a diverse range of cargo, including agricultural products, energy, and containers, and provides a vital shipping link to the Gulf of Mexico.

Under new management since 2021, Canadian National continues to pay a dividend, yielding around 1.8%. The company believes it can match its 3.3% compound annualized growth rate over the past five years, driven by track improvements, strong demand for Canadian energy assets, and the benefits of a combined North American trade area.

CSX: The Eastern Rail Powerhouse

CSX is a major player in eastern rail, with over 20,000 miles of track and access to 70 ports. While historically less efficient than its Canadian and western counterparts, CSX has made significant strides in recent years, delivering compound annual growth of over 15% over the past five years.

The company faces the challenge of maintaining and modernizing century-old assets, but has still generated reliable profits and a dividend currently yielding over 1.1%.

Canadian Pacific: Expanding into the US Market

Canadian Pacific, the smaller of the two major Canadian railroads, is set to transform its business with the planned acquisition of Kansas City Southern, pending regulatory approval. The deal would give Canadian Pacific a vast network down the spine of North America, allowing freight to seamlessly travel around the continent.

While investors should exercise caution during the integration process, Canadian Pacific's dividend, currently yielding around 1.3%, provides a reason to be optimistic about the company's prospects.

Norfolk Southern: The Eastern Rail Alternative

Norfolk Southern is the other major eastern-focused railroad, operating over 19,300 track miles across 22 states and the District of Columbia. The company is a major transporter of industrial, agricultural, and consumer products, as well as a primary source of transportation for coal and auto parts.

Norfolk Southern's revenue has been growing at a 12% annualized rate over the past five years, and the company currently pays a dividend yielding over 1.7%. The company hiked its dividend twice in 2021 and doubled its share repurchase target, with plans to return between 35% and 40% of net income to shareholders in the form of dividends.

Burlington Northern Santa Fe: The Hidden Gem

Burlington Northern Santa Fe, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, operates more than 32,500 miles of track in 28 states and three Canadian provinces. While not a standalone investment opportunity, Berkshire Hathaway's diversified portfolio makes it an attractive option for those seeking exposure to rail.

Railroad stocks offer a unique combination of income, reliability, and modest growth, making them an attractive addition to any portfolio. As the transportation landscape continues to evolve, railroads are poised to take an increasingly important role, providing a safe bet for investors seeking stability in volatile markets.","After analyzing the reference documents from Investopedia, I have identified the following key style attributes:

**Railroad Stocks: A Cyclical Industry with Steady Growth Potential**

The railroad industry has been a cornerstone of the US economy for over a century, and its importance continues to grow. Despite being cyclical, railroad stocks tend to hold up better than most during economic downturns, thanks to their ability to transport large volumes of cargo with minimal labor requirements.

**Industry Consolidation and Efficiency Gains**

Over the years, the industry has consolidated, leading to a handful of titans responsible for moving most of the country's goods. The implementation of ""Precision Scheduled Railroading"" has brought down costs and allowed companies to return more cash to shareholders. Union Pacific, one of the largest railroads, has invested over $35 billion in modernizing and maintaining its 32,200 miles of track.

**Dividend Yield and Growth Potential**

Railroad stocks offer a steady stream of income, with dividend yields ranging from 1.1% to 1.8%. Canadian National, another major player, has a dividend yield of 1.8% and has produced a compound annual growth rate of 3.3% over the past five years. CSX, focused on the eastern half of the country, has delivered compound annual growth of more than 15% over the past five years.

**Diversification and Exposure**

Investors looking to diversify their portfolios can consider railroad stocks as a way to tap into the transportation sector. With their steady cash flows and modest growth potential, railroad stocks can provide a hedge against market volatility. Berkshire Hathaway's ownership of Burlington Northern Santa Fe offers exposure to the industry through a diversified portfolio.

**Conclusion**

Railroad stocks offer a unique combination of steady growth, dividend income, and diversification benefits. As the transportation sector continues to evolve, railroad companies are well-positioned to take advantage of emerging trends and opportunities. For investors seeking a dependable and steady investment, railroad stocks are worth considering.

0.62962962962963,"It's great to see a return of postseason college basketball. Still, it feels a little different this year: Gone are the gratuitous camera shots of exhilarated (or disappointed) fans along with office pool watercooler banter as COVID-19 continues to limit social gatherings and large crowds.
However, you can still get your wagering fix. Thanks to a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned the federal ban on sports betting, online wagering is exploding. According to the American Gaming Association, 17.8 million Americans plan to place an online bet FOR this tournament, up significantly from 5.8 million in 2019.
Investors have taken notice: shares of mobile betting stock DraftKings (DKNG 2.06%) are up more than 200% since announcing its reverse merger with blank check special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Diamond Eagle. This has investors asking when FanDuel is planning to IPO. Recent reports say this is being considered, but here's how you can own FanDuel stock today.
Currently, FanDuel is a subsidiary of Flutter Entertainment Plc (PDYP.Y), a U.K.-based holding company that owns stakes in a host of mobile gaming and sports betting brands including Sky Betting, PokerStars, and Fox Bet.
Flutter Entertainment initially took a majority ownership stake in FanDuel a week after the Supreme Court decision and wisely structured the deal with an option to a commanding interest in FanDuel within five years.
The idea was to leverage the existing relationship and name recognition FanDuel had developed with its daily fantasy app to reach new online bettors. The strategy paid off handsomely, as FanDuel has become the No. 1 mobile betting site in the United States.
In December 2020, Flutter Entertainment made a deal to boost its stake in FanDuel ahead of schedule, acquiring Fastball Holdings 37.2% minority interest for approximately $4.2 billion. Currently Flutter has a 95% stake in the U.S betting giant, with Boyd Gaming having the remaining stake.
Currently, it appears that FanDuel -- via Flutter Entertainment -- is being valued at a discount to DraftKings. At the time of the recent acquisition, Flutter announced that the deal valued FanDuel at an enterprise value of approximately $11 billion, compared to DraftKings' enterprise valuation of $18 billion. Because of stock appreciation since that date, currently DraftKings trades at an enterprise value of $22.3 billion, or approximately 36 times revenue.
Since FanDuel is a subsidiary, Flutter Entertainment does not have to list FanDuel's income or capital structure separately and only reports total U.S. revenue via sports and gaming. Additionally, Flutter's annual reports would not include full contribution from FanDuel's revenue on account of the December transaction discussed above.
However, FanDuel's CEO Matt King said that the company expects to generate $850 million in revenue in 2020, which represents approximately 14% Flutter's total revenue. For a quick comparison, Flutter Entertainment has an enterprise value of $43.5 billion. If FanDuel can command the same sales multiple as DraftKings, it alone would trade at an enterprise value of $30.6 billion -- or nearly 70% of Flutter's total EV -- despite being a minor contributor to its total revenue.
For Flutter to spin off a percentage of those shares for an IPO makes sense to unlock value, as investors are willing to pay up for a leader in an industry with potentially decades of growth as more cash-strapped states legalize gambling to raise revenue.
The key for investors will be to understand the capital structure if/when Flutter chooses to spin off FanDuel stock, as enterprise value includes debt and subtracts cash from market capitalization. That said, FanDuel appears undervalued when compared to recent transactions and public disclosures.

The company raised $300 million earlier this year and now trades on the Nasdaq exchange.
Terms of the potential deal have not been disclosed, yet in 2016, FanDuel claimed its fully diluted value stood at $1.2 billion. The valuation was calculated for the purpose of discussions ended in July regarding a potential merger with its biggest competitor, DraftKings, which has since been barred by antitrust regulators.
The nine-year-old company, which targets the more-than-30 million adult fantasy sports players in North America, has raised more than $416 million in seven rounds of funding, according to Crunchbase. Backers include KKR & Co., NBC Sports, Comcast Corp.'s (CMCSA) venture arm and the National Basketball Association. One source suggests thinking about the potential takeover by Platinum Eagle as more of a fund raise for the New York-based company than as an exit for FanDuel investors, according to Axios.
In November, it was announced that FanDuel Chief Executive Officer Nigel Eccles would step down and be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Matt King. Many viewed the move as a signal of a forthcoming sale.

FanDuel Valuation Appears Discounted Compared to DraftKings

The return of postseason college basketball is a welcome event, albeit with a slight twist this year. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to limit social gatherings and large crowds, which has affected the typical fanfare and office pool banter. Nonetheless, online wagering has seen a significant surge, thanks to the 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned the federal ban on sports betting.

According to the American Gaming Association, 17.8 million Americans plan to place an online bet for this tournament, a substantial increase from 5.8 million in 2019. This growth has caught the attention of investors, who have driven up shares of mobile betting stock DraftKings (DKNG) by more than 200% since its reverse merger with blank-check special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Diamond Eagle. The question on many minds is when FanDuel, another prominent player in the online wagering space, will go public.

Presently, FanDuel is a subsidiary of Flutter Entertainment Plc (PDYP.Y), a U.K.-based holding company that owns stakes in various mobile gaming and sports betting brands, including Sky Betting, PokerStars, and Fox Bet. Flutter Entertainment initially took a majority ownership stake in FanDuel shortly after the Supreme Court decision, with an option to acquire a commanding interest in FanDuel within five years.

At the time of the recent acquisition, Flutter announced that the deal valued FanDuel at an enterprise value of approximately $11 billion, compared to DraftKings' enterprise valuation of $18 billion. Given the stock appreciation since that date, DraftKings currently trades at an enterprise value of $22.3 billion, or approximately 36 times revenue.

As a subsidiary, Flutter Entertainment does not have to report FanDuel's income or capital structure separately, only providing total U.S. revenue via sports and gaming.

**The Surprising Value of FanDuel**

As the NCAA basketball tournament kicks off, fans are eagerly anticipating the excitement of March Madness. However, the pandemic has significantly impacted the way we experience sports, and the typical watercooler banter and enthusiastic crowds are noticeably absent. While we can't replace the electric atmosphere of a live game, online sports betting is filling the void, and FanDuel is leading the charge.

**A Rapidly Growing Industry**

In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting, paving the way for a booming online wagering industry. According to the American Gaming Association, a staggering 17.8 million Americans plan to place online bets on the tournament, up from 5.8 million in 2019. This surge in popularity has caught the attention of investors, who are driving up the shares of mobile betting stocks like DraftKings.

**FanDuel: The Undervalued Player**

But what about FanDuel, the subsidiary of Flutter Entertainment Plc? Despite being the number one mobile betting site in the United States, FanDuel appears to be undervalued compared to its peers. In December 2020, Flutter Entertainment acquired a 95% stake in FanDuel, valuing the company at approximately $11 billion. Meanwhile, DraftKings' enterprise value has soared to $22.3 billion.

**Unlocked Value**

While FanDuel's financials are not publicly disclosed, CEO Matt King revealed that the company expects to generate $850 million in revenue in 2020. If FanDuel can command the same sales multiple as DraftKings, it could trade at an enterprise value of $30.6 billion, nearly 70% of Flutter's total EV. This discrepancy in valuation presents an opportunity for investors to unlock value in FanDuel.

**The Path to an IPO**

With investors clamoring for a piece of the sports betting pie, it's likely that Flutter will consider spinning off a percentage of FanDuel shares for an IPO. This move would unlock value for Flutter shareholders and provide investors with a direct way to own a leader in the rapidly growing sports betting industry.

**The Capital Structure**

When considering an investment in FanDuel, it's essential to understand the capital structure. Enterprise value includes debt and subtracts cash from market capitalization. Investors will need to carefully evaluate the company's financials to determine the true value of FanDuel.

**Conclusion**

The sports betting industry is on the rise, and FanDuel is poised to capitalize on this growth. With its undervalued status compared to peers, investors may find an opportunity to unlock value in this leader in the sports betting space. As the company continues to expand its offerings and solidify its position in the market, it's likely that FanDuel will become an attractive investment opportunity for those seeking to tap into the burgeoning sports betting industry.

Solo entrepreneurs face challenges that many other workers don't, most notably the fact that they don't have a company that automatically offers retirement savings. If you are an independent entrepreneur, you have to come up with your own plan.
Even if a small business owner has made necessary plans for the future, it would be difficult for that small business owner to invest strategically for the near future when they have to deal with personnel decisions, capital allocation, how to grow sales, how to cut costs, and constantly putting out fires. For this reason, it can be especially advantageous for small business owners to consult the services of a financial advisor.
Most small business owners want their business, their future, and their children’s future to be in their control. This is understandable, but if all that time and energy is being put into the business, then who’s going to keep a sharp eye on personal finances? A small business owner isn’t going to have time to see if the U.S. Dollar is appreciating or depreciating and how it might impact their Apple Inc. (AAPL) investment for the current quarter. They also don’t have time to dig into 10-Qs and 10-Ks, follow interest rate moves, read Federal Reserve statements, and track foreign exchange movements.
Furthermore, a financial advisor can help small business owners come up with a formal plan for transferring their business to a new owner when approaching retirement.
In short, a savvy small business owner knows that delegation to the right party saves time and is fiscally rewarding. Therefore, that small business owner will strongly consider hiring a financial advisor. However, that’s just the first step. Now that small business owner needs to figure out which financial advisor to hire.
1. Are you commission-based or fee-based?
You’re looking for fee-based, which means a financial advisor will charge for your time and advice based on a fixed amount or a percentage of assets under management on a quarterly basis. The reason fee-based is often a better option is full transparency. A commission-based financial advisor will make money on financial products sold to you, which leads to a more impersonal relationship.
2. Do you specialize in working with small business owners?
3. Are you a CFP?
A CFP must meet education, examination, experience, and ethics requirements.
4. How can you save me time?
5. What types of advanced technology do you use to keep up with the rest of the industry?
6. How will you offer personalized service?
7. Can you help formulate a business succession plan, including tax, legal, and insurance planning?
8. Do you have any referrals?
Yes, a small business owner needs a financial advisor. By following the tips above, you should increase your odds of finding a financial advisor that’s a good fit for you.

Some projects lend themselves perfectly to the DIY route: You can change your own car oil, paint your home, maybe even patch up your own roof. But managing your small business finances? Unless you have a background in the subject, this is something you could consider leaving in the hands of an expert.
For a small business owner, your finances are like gas in the car. Money keeps your business running. If you manage your cash flow properly, your business can take you to destinations you’ve always dreamed of: rapidly scaling your business, early retirement, and more.
With so many exciting possibilities, it may come as a surprise that 34% of 1,960 small business owners surveyed by the business directory website Manta have no retirement savings plan in place. Many of these business owners state that they don’t have enough profits to fund their retirement.
If you’re struggling to handle your own finances, a small business financial advisor may be the right solution. While it does cost money to work with a financial advisor, the upfront investment can be worth it to increase your business’s financial health, create a plan for your retirement, and more. In this article, we’ll explore what a small business financial advisor does and how they can potentially help your business.

Tell us where you're at in your business journey, and we'll direct you to the experience that fits.
A small business financial advisor is a professional who can help you maximize the capital that goes into starting and running your business.
The most practical part about managing your business finances is that it keeps your business alive. But you didn’t start a business just to skimp by. You want your business to make a profit, scale, and thrive. Keeping your business finances healthy can help you achieve this.
Recommended accounts for operating your business.
A financial advisor can be a useful resource for any business owner. After all, you’ll want the best advice available to you when making decisions about your business finances.
If you have little experience, hiring a financial advisor can be especially helpful. Many businesses fail in their first few years and it’s often due to poor planning and costly mistakes. The expertise of a financial advisor can compensate for your lack of experience. They can help you make sound financial decisions for your business, as well as create a financial plan you can follow for the life of your business.
That said, it’s never too late to consult a small business financial advisor, especially if you’re considering some big changes, like acquiring a new business, passing ownership to someone else in your organization, planning for retirement and more.
We’ll start with a brief questionnaire to better understand the unique needs of your business.
Once we uncover your personalized matches, our team will consult you on the process moving forward.
Working with a small business financial advisor can have myriad benefits for both you and your business. Let’s explore some of these further.
As a small-business owner, you wear a lot of hats and are constantly switching between them. One minute, you might be researching a new marketing strategy. Next, you may be handling some customer service issues. With so much to do, not everything can get your full attention.
But the last thing you should put on your “I’ll get to it” list is your business finances. Poor bookkeeping, unsound financial decisions and cash flow “clogs” can negatively affect your business.
That’s where delegating your business finances to an expert comes in handy. While you’re running your business operations, a financial advisor will help keep the capital flowing as well as help you develop a plan for what to do with that capital.
Many small business owners might not know that they’re overspending in certain areas of their businesses. A small business financial advisor will evaluate your business finances and see where you can cut unnecessary costs.
As we mentioned, you will have to spend money to work with a financial advisor. However, as the saying goes, “you have to spend money to make money.” This business expense should lead to growth down the line.
When you write your business plan, you can have grand ideas about where you want to take your business. Often, these goals can be financially unrealistic and you’ll need an objective outlook if you want to bring your business idea to fruition.
This is where a small business financial advisor comes in. Earlier, we mentioned that capital is like gas in a car. Your business plan is the coordinates you put into your GPS—while the directions are there, you won’t get anywhere if the tank is bone-dry. A financial advisor can help you put gas in the tank so that you can get your business to its end destination.
Some financial advisors will be more involved in the execution of the business, including researching market trends. Some markets are more competitive than others and you’ll need an expert opinion on how your business will fare in such a market.
Market projections, advancing technology and other factors can affect the growth of your business. You want to ensure your business is financially healthy so you can weather challenges and capitalize on opportunities.
For many business owners, their investments are all wrapped up in their business with the logic that they can later sell their business to fund their retirement. While it’s natural to want to give your business everything you have, this is an unwise investment strategy. A healthy investment portfolio is one that is diversified. A financial advisor can offer personal finance tips and help you choose which investments work best for your unique situation, including when and how you want to retire.
As your business starts generating more revenue, your small business financial advisor can also help you decide how to invest this capital to continue growing your business.
Whether retirement is a long way off or just around the corner, this isn’t the only instance when you should consider what will happen to your business when you’re no longer in charge. While it’s a more difficult conversation to have, you should create a plan for what would happen to your business in the event of your death or disability, known as a succession plan.
Your small business financial advisor can help you draft this document so there are clear instructions on how to keep the business running or prepare for its sale in your absence.
You may be tempted to choose the first financial advisor you come across, but as with every other decision you make for your business, research is key. Beyond finding a financial advisor who specializes in small business finances and works with other business owners, you’ll also want to find someone with whom you’re comfortable. Talking about finances isn’t everyone’s favorite topic, but if you can’t openly discuss your finances—the good and the bad—your advisor won’t be very useful.
When a financial advisor is a fiduciary, it confirms that they are legally obligated to always prioritize the client’s interest. This means that if they had the option to recommend a client Option A (which would make the advisor more money) or Option B (which is in the client’s best interest), the financial advisor is legally required to recommend Option B.
If your small business financial advisor is not a fiduciary, you can’t be sure they’re acting in your best interest.
Another consideration when finding the right small business financial advisor is their pricing structure. Finding an advisor who charges a flat fee is typically the more transparent route to go. Financial advisors who work by commission, on the other hand, can create conflicts of interest. They might operate in a way that nets them the most commission but isn’t necessarily best for you. Flat-fee models eliminate this incentive and encourage financial advisors to focus on offering value over volume.
What is your pricing structure (flat fee or commission)?
What are your qualifications and designations?
How many years of experience do you have?
Do you have experience working with small business owners?
Do you have any referrals?
If you’re still not sure if a small business financial advisor can provide value to you and your business, here are some mistakes you can avoid with professional guidance.
Many entrepreneurs start their own small businesses because they want to write their own paychecks. However, overpaying yourself can stunt the growth of your business. A financial advisor can assess your business’s financial health and determine whether your cut of the profit is reasonable.
On the other hand, if you’re afraid to pay yourself anything because you don’t want to detract from the business, they can also help you settle on an appropriate amount so both your needs and the needs of your business are met.
Keeping your personal and business expenses separate is key for many reasons, including tax and liability purposes, but you may be unsure how to set up and manage separate accounts. A small business financial advisor can help you find the right business bank account for you, as well as manage these separate accounts.
Should you run your business as a sole proprietor, form an LLC, or start a corporation? These are questions you’ll likely be confused about when you first start running your business—and you may decide to revisit it down the line for tax purposes. Consulting with your small business financial advisor can help you understand each business structure and which would best fit your business model and goals.
A small business financial advisor can do more than assist you with managing your business assets. They can also walk you through personal financial decisions, like your retirement plans. A financial advisor will help prepare to smooth the transition between running a business and retirement with a business exit strategy.
It’s easy for small business owners to be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of small business insurance plans available. However, you want to make sure you and your employees are covered—from the required, like unemployment insurance, to optional plans that could provide a significant income, like key person insurance.
Today, robots can do more than vacuum and mop your floors. Robots can even help you manage your finances.
A robo-advisor is an automated investing service that uses algorithms to build and grow your investment portfolio. Depending on which robo-advisor you choose, you can manage your taxes, optimize your investment portfolio, plan for retirement, and more. Also, a robo-advisor can be a cost-effective alternative to hiring a small business financial advisor.
Sometimes you want to manage your finances yourself but you still need some guidance. Some financial advisors allow you to consult them for advice only (although many of them are hoping to take you on as a client). Paying a one-time fee for counsel on your current financial situation can help you make the right decisions for yourself.
Hiring a small business financial advisor is not necessary but it is highly recommended. A financial advisor may ask questions about your business you didn't even know to ask. Most importantly, a financial expert will help to strengthen the long-term financial health of your business. Capital is the lifeblood of your business and it’s an aspect of your business that you should consider leaving in the hands of a competent financial professional.

**Solo Entrepreneurs Face Unique Retirement Savings Challenges**

As a solo entrepreneur, you're likely no stranger to hard work and dedication. But when it comes to retirement savings, going it alone can be especially daunting. Without the safety net of a company-sponsored 401(k) or pension plan, solo entrepreneurs must take matters into their own hands.

**The Struggle is Real: Saving for Retirement as a Small Business Owner**

It's tough to invest strategically for the future when you're busy putting out fires, making personnel decisions, and allocating capital. That's why consulting a financial advisor can be a game-changer for solo entrepreneurs. They can help you create a formal plan for transferring your business to a new owner when you're ready to retire.

**Why You Need a Financial Advisor (And How to Find the Right One)**

As a savvy small business owner, you know that delegating tasks to the right people can save you time and money. But that's only half the battle. You need to find a financial advisor who's a good fit for you and your business. Here are some questions to ask potential advisors:

* Are you commission-based or fee-based? Look for a fee-based advisor who charges by the hour or as a percentage of assets under management.
* Do you specialize in working with small business owners like me?
* Are you a certified financial planner (CFP)?
* How can you save me time and energy?
* What kind of advanced technology do you use to stay ahead of the curve?
* How will you offer personalized service tailored to my needs?
* Can you help me formulate a business succession plan, including tax, legal, and insurance planning?
* Do you have any referrals from satisfied clients?

By asking the right questions, you can increase your chances of finding a financial advisor who's a good match for you and your business.

**In Short, Solo Entrepreneurs Need a Financial Advisor**

As a solo entrepreneur, you wear many hats. But when it comes to your personal finances, it's essential to have a trusted expert in your corner. By delegating tasks to a financial advisor, you can save time, reduce stress, and focus on what matters most – growing your business and securing your financial future.

**Disclaimer:**

It's essential to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of NerdWallet:

**Solo Entrepreneurs: Do You Need a Financial Advisor?**

As a solo entrepreneur, you face unique challenges that other workers don't. One of the biggest hurdles is navigating retirement savings without the support of a company-sponsored plan. If you're an independent entrepreneur, you need to come up with your own plan.

**Strategic Planning is Key**

Even if you've made necessary plans for the future, it can be tough to invest strategically for the near future when you're juggling personnel decisions, capital allocation, sales growth, cost-cutting, and putting out fires. That's where a financial advisor can help.

**Why a Financial Advisor Makes Sense**

Most solo business owners want control over their business, future, and their children's future. However, with all your energy focused on the business, who's keeping an eye on your personal finances? A financial advisor can help you make informed decisions about investments, such as tracking the U.S. Dollar's performance and its impact on your Apple Inc. (AAPL) investment.

**Finding the Right Financial Advisor**

When searching for a financial advisor, consider the following:

1. **Are you commission-based or fee-based?** Opt for a fee-based advisor for transparency.
2. **Do you specialize in working with small business owners?**
3. **Are you a CFP?** Ensure your advisor meets education, examination, experience, and ethics requirements.
4. **How can you save me time?**
5. **What advanced technology do you use to stay current with industry trends?**
6. **How will you offer personalized service?**
7. **Can you help formulate a business succession plan, including tax, legal, and insurance planning?**
8. **Do you have any referrals?**

By following these tips, you can increase your chances of finding a financial advisor that's a good fit for you.

0.603448275862069,"Student loan borrowers have a number of options when the time comes to start repaying their loans. Federal student loans offer the most flexibility, while the choices for private student loans are limited.
The best way for you to repay will depend on the kind of loans you have, how much you owe, and where you stand financially after graduation.
There are multiple repayment plans that you may be eligible for if you have federal student loans. Here’s how they compare.
As of June 2023, just 3.3% of applicants qualified for forgiveness, while the remainder have yet to fulfill this criteria.2 So be forewarned: Receiving loan forgiveness under the PSLF program is not an easy task.
Whether or not you should choose an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan hinges on several factors, including what you’re earning now and your future earning potential.
“Some students will enter the workforce immediately with a high-paying job, while others will work their way up,” says Lena Chukhno, general manager of student loan refinancing at Earnest. Other variables that come into play when making this decision include the amount of debt you owe and whether you plan to go back to school for a graduate degree at some point.
“You can always refinance your loan down the line if the situation changes, but it’s best to start off on the right note so you don’t get into financial trouble,” says Chukhno.
Depending on your lender, you may be eligible for a deferment or forbearance period if you aren’t able to keep up with your regular loan payments. But this typically requires a financial hardship, and it isn’t offered by every lender.
If you have private student loans, it’s important to do the math so you know what the various repayment options will cost you in interest over the life of the loan.
You might also consider refinancing your private loans if that would get you a lower interest rate. This can save you money on interest during the repayment term. Refinancing a student loan typically involves a credit check, so if you don’t yet have a solid credit history, you may need a co-signer to qualify.
There are several variables that determine what repayment plan(s) you might be eligible for, including your income and debt. If you have a loan from a private lender such as a bank, contact the lender to discuss your options. If you have a federal loan, the U.S. Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid website breaks down the options.
Yes. There is a loan simulator tool on the Federal Student Aid website that can help you calculate your potential loan payment and see which plan might suit you best.
If you owe education debt, take time to get to know your repayment options. Ideally, this is something you do before graduation so you have an idea of which repayment plan you want to start with. If you’re choosing an income-driven plan, reevaluate your finances each year to see if another repayment option might be better for saving money on interest charges.

Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money.
Borrowers can choose from four types of federal student loan repayment plans. But the best one for you will likely be the standard repayment plan or an income-driven repayment plan, depending on your goals.
Standard repayment lasts 10 years and is the best one to stick with to pay less in interest over time.
Income-driven repayment (IDR) options tie the amount you pay to a portion of your income and extend the length of time you're in repayment to 20 or 25 years. When the term is over, you can get income-driven loan forgiveness for your remaining debt. IDR is best if you're having difficulty meeting your monthly payment and need something more manageable. There are four types of IDR plans.
Graduated repayment lowers your monthly payments and then increases the amount you pay every two years for a total of 10 years.
Extended repayment starts payment amounts low and then increases every two years for a total of 25 years. Or you can choose a fixed version which splits payment amounts evenly over 25 years.
Before changing student loan repayment plans, plug your information into the Education Department's Loan Simulator to see what you’ll owe on each plan. Any option that decreases your monthly payments will likely result in you paying more interest overall.
Best repayment option: standard repayment.
On the standard student loan repayment plan, you make equal monthly payments for 10 years. If you can afford the standard plan, you’ll pay less in interest and pay off your loans faster than you would on other federal repayment plans.
How to enroll in this plan: You’re automatically placed in the standard plan when you enter repayment.
Best repayment option: income-driven repayment.
The government offers four IDR plans: income-based repayment, income-contingent repayment, Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE). These options are best if your income is too low to afford the standard repayment.
Income-driven plans set monthly payments between 10% and 20% of your discretionary income. Payments can be as small as $0 if you're unemployed or underemployed and can change annually. Income-driven plans extend your loan term to 20 or 25 years, depending on the type of debt you have. At the end of that term, you get IDR student loan forgiveness on your remaining debt — but you may pay taxes on the forgiven amount.
The Education Department has announced another new IDR plan option that would cut payments by at least half and forgive some borrowers' debt after 10 years, instead of 20 or 25. It's not yet finalized or available to borrowers; rollout will begin at the end of 2023.
How to enroll in these plans: You can apply for income-driven repayment with your federal student loan servicer or at studentaid.gov. When you apply, you can choose which plan you want or opt for the lowest payment. Taking the lowest payment is best in most cases, though you may want to examine your options if your tax filing status is married filing jointly.
» MORE: Which income-driven repayment plan is right for you?
Best repayment option: graduated student loan repayment plan.
If your income is high, but you want lower payments, a graduated plan may make sense for you.
Graduated repayment decreases your payments at first — potentially to as little as the interest accruing on your loan — then increases them every two years to finish repayment in 10 years.
If your income is high compared with your debt, you may initially pay less under graduated repayment than an income-driven plan. This could free up money in the short term for a different goal, like a down payment on a home, without costing you as much interest as an income-driven plan. You would still pay more interest than under standard repayment.
Initial payments on the graduated plan can eventually triple in size. You need to be confident you’ll be able to make the larger payments if you choose this plan. Generally speaking, it’s best to stick with the standard plan if you can afford it.
How to enroll in these plans: Your federal student loan servicer can change your repayment plan to graduated repayment.
Best repayment option: extended student loan repayment plan.
The extended plan lowers payments by stretching your repayment period to as long as 25 years. You must owe more than $30,000 in federal student loans to qualify for extended repayment.
You can choose to pay the same amount each month over that new loan term — like under the standard repayment plan — or you can opt for graduated payments. Whether you choose equal or graduated extended payments, you’ll have a good idea of what you’ll pay each month in the future.
Extended repayment does not offer loan forgiveness like income-driven repayment plans do; you will pay off the loan completely by the end of the repayment term.
How to enroll in these plans: Your federal student loan servicer can change your repayment plan to extended repayment.
To get rid of your debt sooner than your monthly payments allow, you can prepay loans. This will save you interest with any repayment plan, but the impact will be greatest under standard repayment. Just be sure to tell your student loan servicer to apply the extra payment to your principal balance instead of toward your next monthly payment.
You may be able to temporarily postpone repayment altogether with deferment or forbearance. Some loans accrue interest during deferment, and all accrue interest during normal forbearance periods. This increases the amount you owe.
If your financial struggles are pay-related, income-driven repayment is a better option. Income-driven repayment plans can reduce payments to $0 — and those payments count toward forgiveness.
Best repayment option: income-driven repayment.
Public Service Loan Forgiveness is a federal program available to government, public school teachers and certain nonprofit employees. If you’re eligible, your remaining loan balance could be forgiven tax-free after you make 120 qualifying loan payments.
Only payments made under the standard repayment plan or an income-driven repayment plan qualify for PSLF. To benefit, you need to make most of the 120 payments on an income-driven plan. On the standard plan, you would pay off the loan before it’s eligible for forgiveness.
How to enroll in these plans: You can apply for income-driven repayment with your servicer or at studentaid.gov.
Private student loans don’t qualify for income-driven repayment, though some lenders offer student loan repayment options that temporarily reduce payments. If you’re struggling to repay private student loans, call your lender and ask about your options.
If you have a credit score in at least the high-600s — or a cosigner who does — there’s little downside to refinancing private student loans at a lower interest rate. Dozens of lenders offer student loan refinancing; compare your options before you apply to get the lowest possible rate.
Private lenders also refinance federal student loans, which can save you money if you qualify for a lower interest rate. But refinancing federal student loans is risky because you lose access to benefits like income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness. Refinance federal loans only if you’re comfortable giving up those options.

The right repayment plan depends on the type of loans you have, your current financial situation, and your future earning potential. With federal student loans, you may be eligible for multiple repayment plans. Here's a breakdown of how they compare.

**The Limitations of Public Service Loan Forgiveness**

As of June 2023, only 3.3% of applicants qualified for forgiveness, highlighting the challenges of meeting the criteria. While it's not easy to achieve loan forgiveness under the PSLF program, it's crucial to be aware of the options available to you.

**Income-Driven Repayment Plans: Weighing the Pros and Cons**

Choosing an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan hinges on several factors, including your current income, future earning potential, and debt amount. ""Some students will enter the workforce immediately with a high-paying job, while others will work their way up,"" says Lena Chukhno, general manager of student loan refinancing at Earnest. It's essential to consider these variables when making a decision.

**Deferment and Forbearance: Understanding Your Options**

If you're struggling to make regular loan payments, you may be eligible for a deferment or forbearance period, depending on your lender. However, this typically requires a financial hardship, and not all lenders offer this option.

**Private Student Loans: Crunching the Numbers**

If you have private student loans, it's crucial to calculate the various repayment options to determine the total interest cost over the life of the loan. You may also want to consider refinancing your private loans to secure a lower interest rate, which can save you money on interest charges.

**Repayment Plan Eligibility: Factors to Consider**

Several variables determine which repayment plan(s) you may be eligible for, including your income, debt, and lender. If you have a federal loan, the U.S. Department of Education's Federal Student Aid website provides a detailed breakdown of your options. You can also use the loan simulator tool to calculate your potential loan payment and determine which plan best suits your needs.

**Take Control of Your Student Loan Repayment**

To avoid financial trouble, it's essential to understand your repayment options and make an informed decision. If you're choosing an income-driven plan, regularly reevaluate your finances to ensure you're on the right track. By doing so, you can optimize your repayment strategy and achieve financial stability.

Remember, taking the time to understand your repayment options can make a significant difference in your financial future.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of NerdWallet:

**Navigating Student Loan Repayment Options**

Repaying student loans can be a daunting task, especially with the numerous options available. Federal student loans offer the most flexibility, while private student loans have limited choices. The best repayment plan for you depends on the type of loans you have, your debt amount, and your financial situation after graduation.

**Understanding Federal Repayment Plans**

If you have federal student loans, you may be eligible for multiple repayment plans. As of June 2023, only 3.3% of applicants qualified for forgiveness, so it's essential to carefully consider your options. Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans may be suitable for you, depending on your current income, future earning potential, and debt amount.

**Factors to Consider**

When deciding on a repayment plan, consider the following factors:

* Your current income and future earning potential
* The amount of debt you owe
* Whether you plan to pursue a graduate degree
* Your lender's options for deferment or forbearance

**Refinancing Private Student Loans**

If you have private student loans, refinancing may be a viable option to lower your interest rate. This can save you money on interest over the life of the loan. However, refinancing typically involves a credit check, so you may need a co-signer if you don't have a solid credit history.

**Exploring Repayment Options**

To determine which repayment plan is best for you, consider the following:

* Contact your lender to discuss your options
* Use the Federal Student Aid website's loan simulator tool to calculate your potential loan payments and compare plans
* Evaluate your finances each year to ensure you're on the right track

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2022 financial results conference call. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that this conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Alexia Quadrani, senior vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead.
Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website.
Joining me for today's call are Bob Chapek, Disney's chief executive officer, and Christine McCarthy, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Walt Disney wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, Disney's employees and cast members continued to execute against our strategic priorities of storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus, and I could not be more proud of what they've achieved. Our strong results this quarter, including fantastic performance at our domestic parks and continued growth at our streaming services along with the creative achievements of our content teams, once again proved that we are in a league of our own. We have entertainment's most iconic brands and the world's favorite franchises, a high-quality creative pipeline that will continue to drive engagement and consumption and an unrivaled synergy machine with touch points that reach audiences across distribution channels, geographies and demographics, all of which come together to create a deep, emotional connection with audiences across generations.
I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter that illustrate these strengths, and then Christine will go through the details of our results. As I said, our domestic parks were a standout. They continue to fire on all cylinders, powered by strong demand coupled with customized and personalized guest experience enhancements that grew per capita spending by more than 40% versus 2019. Response to next-generation storytelling like Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser has been phenomenal.
In fact, guest ratings for this immersive experience, which opened March 1, are incredibly high and in line with our best-in-class offerings. Demand is strong, and we expect 100% utilization through the end of Q3. Looking ahead, we could not be more excited to officially welcome riders on Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at Epcot on May 27. One of the longest indoor rollercoasters in the world, the attraction puts guests in the middle of an exciting adventure as they're called on to help the Guardians out of a jam.
With our first-ever reverse launch and rotating cars that turn riders 360 degrees, guests won't miss a second of the story during our most immersive coaster experience yet. At Disneyland Paris, we are thrilled to take the next step in our ambitious expansion plan: the opening of Avengers Campus this summer as part of the resort's 30th anniversary celebration. As Europe recovers from the pandemic, we've seen strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris and look forward to its continued recovery. Another standout this quarter were our streaming services.
We ended Q2 with more than 205 million total subscriptions after adding 9.2 million in the quarter. That includes 7.9 million Disney+ subscribers, keeping us on track to reach 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by fiscal '24. The growth of the platform since its launch reinforces its unique nature. Quite simply, we believe Disney+ is one of a kind, a service based on exceptional branded content with wide appeal across all four quadrants.
It's certainly popular with families, but as a reminder, almost half of Disney+ subscribers are adults without kids. In recognition of Disney+'s unique ability to attract viewers from a range of demographic groups, we are selectively enhancing Disney+ with general entertainment titles designed to drive sign-ups among specific audiences and deepen engagement among those cohorts. A benefit of our incredible creative engines and decades of general entertainment excellence is that we can reach these demographics not only through the creation of original titles but also by shifting resources from across our content ecosystem, especially as consumer behavior continues to evolve. Our strategy is not just to fill our distribution pipelines but to be thoughtful with each asset to best position it among our various distribution options.
For instance, Dancing with the Stars is a beloved show that has entertained viewers for more than 30 seasons on ABC and is a wonderful example of content that brings the whole family together. We recently announced Disney+ will be the series' new home starting this fall. Beyond targeting specific demos, we are equally enthusiastic about our growth potential in international markets. We currently have over 500 local original titles in various stages of development and production.
180 of those titles are slated to premiere this fiscal year, increasing to over 300 international originals per year in steady state. We believe these premium local originals, along with branded content with broad international appeal, will attract new subscribers and drive engagement. One example in production is Nautilus from our EMEA team. Based on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Nautilus is the origin story of the iconic submarine from the perspective of its mysterious commander, Captain Nemo.
This is just one example of how our global network of creative hubs can develop and produce original content with worldwide appeal. And by the end of we plan to roll out Disney+ to 53 new markets across Europe, Africa and West Asia, starting with South Africa next week. Before leaving Disney+, I want to mention our recently announced plans to introduce an ad-supported subscription offering in the US by the end of the calendar year and internationally in 2023. Expanding Disney+ access through multiple price points is a win for consumers and advertisers.
Of course, all of our success is rooted in great content. Our general entertainment team continued its string of phenomenal series with Hulu's Pam & Tommy and The Dropout. And while not in the quarter, we could not be happier with the performance of The Kardashians, more great general entertainment content is ahead, like the second season of Only Murders in the Building on Hulu and the record-breaking 19th season of ABC's Grey's Anatomy. This quarter, our studios earned six Academy awards, including Best Animated Feature for Walt Disney Animation Studios, Encanto, and Best Documentary Feature for Onyx Collective and Searchlight Pictures Summer of Soul.
Pixar Animation Studios' Turning Red premiered on March 11 on Disney+ and became the fastest title to reach 200 million hours viewed on the platform. The Disney+ original series Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett drew positive reaction from audiences, and Marvel's Moon Knight continue the studio's impressive track record. Looking ahead, our studios will continue to deliver high-quality content at scale with an exciting array of series and films coming to all of our distribution channels. In fact, our slate for the remainder of this year is incredibly strong with titles like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ms.
Marvel, Lightyear, Thor: Love and Thunder, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and the long-anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water. Finally, I must mention the phenomenal success of Marvel's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which opened to roughly $450 million worldwide this past weekend. Domestically, it was the second-highest opening of the pandemic era and the 11th highest opening of all time. Our strategy of distribution flexibility has worked well for us, and these fantastic results are another sign of our ability to succeed no matter of the platform.
That success extends to sports. ESPN viewership was notably strong for the quarter across both live events and studio programming with ratings up double digits, and we remain encouraged by how fans are engaging with sports content coming out of the pandemic. Opening weekend of the NBA Playoffs was the most viewed in the past decade, and the ratings have been fantastic with over 4.3 million average viewers through 20 games on ABC and ESPN. Our groundbreaking NHL deal is unique in its exposure across ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, culminating with the Stanley Cup Playoffs, which began on May 2.
In fact, the combination of the NHL and NBA Playoffs going on simultaneously kicks off an exciting stretch of championship programming that also includes Wimbledon, the NCAA Women's and Men's College World Series, UFC, Boxing and more. Coming off the success of Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli, we recently debuted our new season-long MLB alternative broadcast, KayRod Cast with Michael Kay and Alex Rodriguez. And we began the inaugural season of PGA TOUR Live on ESPN+, featuring over 4,000 hours of live golf coverage from 35 tournaments. Before I hand it over to Christine, I want to say a few words about our unique synergy machine or franchise flywheel, if you prefer.
What sets Disney apart is our ability to reach people with our uniquely engaging content across an array of touch points to make our portfolio of businesses and brands a bigger part of their lives. This enables us to not only create new franchises like Encanto, but to also build on existing IP across our lines of business. One example of this is our Toy Story franchise, which was created almost three decades ago with the release of the first film in 1995 and which is now brought to life across distribution platforms, geographies, businesses and time. In our parks, we've built a portfolio of four immersive Toy Story lands with more than 20 attractions and live character interactions available around the world, as well as two themed hotels.
The franchise is the cornerstone of Disney+ with all four feature-length films, as well as the original short series, Forky Asks a Question, exclusively available on the service. And nearly 30 years after the film debuted, Toy Story is still a key consumer products franchise, generating over $1 billion in annual retail sales. And in just a few weeks, Pixar's Lightyear will tell the origin story of everyone's favorite space ranger when it hits theaters on June 17. Of course, Toy Story is just one of our many franchises, but it illustrates our unparalleled ability to bring stories to life in more ways for more people in more places.
In fact, our franchise library and capabilities will continue to set us apart even further as we bring our IP to life through next-generation storytelling that is more integrated and connected across consumer touch points. As we look to our second century, that's our mission: to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger, more connected and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine.
Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter were $1.08, an increase of $0.29 versus the prior year quarter. We continue to be pleased with our financial results with total segment operating income increasing by 50% versus the prior year quarter and by over 80% year-to-date. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment continued to show strong signs of growth and recovery as operating income increased by nearly $2.2 billion year-over-year to approximately $1.8 billion.
Growth was primarily driven by our domestic parks, which were open for the entire quarter. In the prior year, Walt Disney World was open, but Disneyland was closed for the entire quarter. We continue to be pleased with the overall demand and attendance trends at our domestic parks. In fact, there were many days in the quarter where we saw demand exceed 2019 levels.
However, we are continuing to control attendance through our reservation system with an eye on delivering a quality guest experience. As Bob mentioned earlier, per capita guest spending at our domestic parks increased by over 40% versus Q2 of fiscal 2019 and by 20% versus Q2 of fiscal 2021 with increases across the board on admissions, food and beverage and merchandise. Looking ahead to the third quarter. Our forward-looking demand pipeline at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland remains robust.
And while attendance from international visitation is still in the early days of recovery, we are beginning to see some improvements. We are also thrilled that as of the end of March, all of our domestic resorts are now open, a major milestone as we continue to move through the impacts of the pandemic. At our international parks, operating results improved versus the prior year due to growth at Disneyland Paris, which was open in Q2 and closed during the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by lower results at Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disney, both of which were impacted by COVID-related closures in the quarter.
Consumer Products operating income increased in the quarter, reflecting higher sales of merchandise based on several of our iconic franchises, including Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man, Star Wars and Disney Princess. Moving on to the Media & Entertainment Distribution segment. Second quarter operating income decreased by approximately $900 million versus the prior year as revenue growth of about $1.2 billion, primarily driven by direct-to-consumer was more than offset by higher expenses, including programming and production expenses at linear networks and direct-to-consumer, which came roughly in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. At our linear networks business, operating income in the quarter was $2.8 billion or roughly flat versus the prior year as modest growth at our domestic channels was offset by a decline at our international channels.
Domestically, higher operating income at broadcasting was partially offset by lower results at cable. Broadcasting results benefited year-over-year from affiliate revenue growth in addition to higher advertising revenue due to the timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in Q2 this year versus Q3 last year. These impacts were partially offset by higher programming and production costs also driven by the timing of the Academy Awards. At cable, lower operating income versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase in programming and production costs.
The largest component of the increased cost was driven by four additional NFL games versus the prior year, consisting of three regular season games, as well as the return of the Pro Bowl. These impacts were partially offset by growth in cable advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at ESPN increased by over 30% in the quarter, and third quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up significantly benefiting from a return to a pre-COVID NBA schedule that is driving increased viewership and pricing. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 5% in the quarter.
This was primarily driven by seven points of growth from higher rates, partially offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating income at our international channels decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower affiliate revenue and an increase in programming and production costs, partially offset by advertising revenue growth. At direct-to-consumer, operating losses widened to almost $900 million due to higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ and lower operating income at Hulu. The higher losses at our DTC services were largely driven by higher programming and production expenses, in line with what we noted in our guidance last quarter.
At Disney+, programming and production costs grew along with marketing and technology costs to support our growth around the world, partially offset by higher subscription revenue. We ended the quarter with nearly 138 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting close to 8 million net additions from Q1. A little over half of those net adds were from Disney+ Hotstar, which benefited from the start of the new IPL season toward the end of the second quarter. Internationally, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added over 2 million paid subscribers versus the first quarter with Latin America being the strongest contributor, driven by growth of the Combo+ offering.
Domestically, net adds of approximately 1.5 million reflect in part the success of tentpole content releases, including Turning Red and Moon Knight, as well as the strength of our bundled and multiproduct offerings. ESPN+ ended Q2 with 22.3 million paid subscribers, a net increase of about 1 million versus Q1. Operating results decreased compared to the prior year due to higher sports programming costs and lower pay-per-view income, partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, which ended the second quarter with 45.6 million paid subscribers, higher subscription and advertising revenues versus the prior year were more than offset by higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs.
Moving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased by approximately $300 million versus the prior year, driven by lower TV and SVOD results, which we discussed in our guidance last quarter, in addition to a decrease in home entertainment results. As a reminder, these impacts are deliberately aligned with our strategic decision to utilize our content on our own direct-to-consumer services. Before I touch on a few things that we'd like you to keep in mind for the back half of the fiscal year, I'll quickly note two other relevant items for the second quarter.
We recognized a revenue reversal of $1 billion related to the early termination of content licensing agreements with a customer in order to make that content available on our own direct-to-consumer services. Because substantially all of the consideration we received was recognized as revenue at the time that content was originally made available in previous years, we've recorded amounts to terminate the agreement net of remaining amounts of deferred revenue as a revenue reversal. Finally, a note on the impact of some tax-related items on our Q2 EPS. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items of $1.08, includes an adverse impact of approximately $0.11 due to the impact of higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of a recent change in US tax regulations.
It's worth mentioning that while our annual effective tax rate has generally been correlated with the US statutory rate, there are many complex puts and takes in any given period, which can lead to these variances quarter-to-quarter. And we currently expect the full year tax rate could remain somewhat elevated above the US statutory rate. Now, as it relates to the third quarter and the second half of fiscal 2022. At DPEP, closures at our Asia theme parks could adversely impact operating income in the third quarter by up to approximately $350 million versus the prior year.
As a reminder, Hong Kong Disneyland was closed for the first three weeks of the quarter, Shanghai Disney has been closed quarter-to-date, and we do not yet have visibility to a reopening date. As we continue to strategically prioritize leveraging our content for our own services, we expect content sales, licensing and other operating results to decrease in the third quarter by approximately $150 million to $200 million versus the prior year. The expected decrease is primarily driven by declines in content licensing along with a continued decline in home entertainment results. direct-to-consumer programming and production costs in Q3 are expected to increase by more than $900 million year-over-year, reflecting higher original content expense at Disney+ and Hulu, increased sports rights costs and higher programming fees at Hulu Live.
At Disney+, while we still expect higher net adds in the second half of the year versus the first half, it's worth mentioning that we did have a stronger-than-expected first half of the year. Additionally, note that some of the Eastern European markets we're launching in toward the end of Q3, including Poland, are in regions being impacted by geopolitical factors. As it relates to content spend, we previously stated that we expect fiscal year 2022 cash content spend to total as much as $33 billion. We've adjusted that amount to as much as $32 billion to reflect a slightly slower cadence of spending than anticipated during the first half of the year.
Note that we are still expecting a strong content slate in the back half of the year. And as Bob mentioned, we are confident in our long-term subscriber guidance of 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subs by fiscal 2024. We also still expect that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.
Thank you, Christine. We are happy to be back here in person for this call, but to make it easier, I will help direct the questions. [Operator instructions] And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.
Your first question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Yes. Thanks for taking the question. And Bob touched on pricing to some degree during his comments. So I thought we could come back to that.
One of the questions we've been getting is, how do you think about the right cadence for revisiting pricing on Disney+ really when you can take price higher? It just seems like there's a lot of factors that would go into that, including the fact you'll be launching a new ad-supported tier. You're putting a lot more content onto the service. You've seen some increased competition. And obviously, there's some inflationary pressures, and I'm just not quite sure if you put all that to a pot what that yields in terms of how you're thinking about pricing.
All right. Thank you. As you know, we launch with an extremely attractive opening price point on Disney+, and we've been very comfortable with the price-value relationship that we've offered. And as you know, as we increase our content investment, we believe that that's going to give us the ability to adjust our price by -- and still, at the same time, maintain that strong value proposition.
You mentioned the Disney+ ad tier I think this is going to give us the ability to reach an even more broad audience as we expand Disney+ across multiple price points. And using some of our other services, we can see the additive nature of an ad-driven service that enables us to keep the price lower. Of course, that's made up for by the additional revenue that we would get per user on the advertising spending. So we believe that we can sort of move up and cascade up our net price over time given the tremendous value that we started with and the increased price-value relationship of all the new content, but we're pretty bullish about that.
Next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thanks. Good afternoon.  A question and if I can, Alexia, just a clarification from the prepared remarks. On parks, as you know, you'll start to lap some really strong significant double-digit per-capita growth as you move through the rest of the summer and into the fall. And I'm just wondering, particularly given how focused everybody is on the economy and inflation, the consumer, if you're seeing any signs that would suggest that you're going to see substantial deceleration or even maybe not grow your per capita growth at the domestic parks.
Just be curious on how you're thinking about the full year and as you lap these comparisons. And then, I just wanted to come back, Christine, on the second half net adds. Are you still expecting a stronger second half at Disney+ than the first half and you're just calling out that maybe the relative comparison won't be as pronounced? I just wanted to make sure I understood what you -- we understood what you were saying. Thank you.
Bob, why don't you take the first half and then Christine can follow up?
OK. So we continue to see really strong demand, and we're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing, particularly as we're going to get some improvements to international visitation. But we're controlling our attendance, as Christine mentioned in her comments, using our reservation system to optimize the guest experience. But that domestic yield strategy, and we're also seeing it in Paris, is really exceeding our expectations.
If you remember, last quarter, we mentioned that we had some high hopes for it, but we were seeing well above what we had anticipated. Well, I'm happy to say that in Q2 we're even, as you say, we're lapping those numbers again even higher. So we're very, very encouraged by the continuation of the trends that we're seeing in terms of the number of people. For example, that sign-up for Genie+, plus the willingness to come to our parks with our balanced reservation system, which really helps us sort of manage our price per day, if you will.
So that domestic yield strategy has really structurally allowed us to increase that per-capita spending meaningfully without having to rely solely on raising ticket prices, and we don't see any end in sight for that.
Great. Ben, your question on net adds for the second half of the year. We still do expect an increase over the first half. However, the first half came in better than expected, so that delta that we had initially anticipated may not be as large.
But we still do expect an increase in the second half to exceed the first half.
Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Thank you. I have two. First would be, Bob, it seems that the equity markets are now focused on, kind of, the cost to achieve subscriber growth and maybe not just focused on the sub numbers as much as the cost to achieve. So I wonder, given the rising content costs you're seeing in things like sports and competition around the globe, how do you measure maybe the need to drive shareholder returns versus attaining those sub targets that were laid out in 2020? And how do you -- and how and when will you determine what the ROIC would be on maybe the next 100 million subs versus the first 100 million subs? And then, Christine, can you talk a bit about any type of incremental margins at the parks? Very strong so far, halfway through the year.
Any type of inflation on the parks that could limit maybe the margin growth we've seen at this point? So thanks.
So as you know, we're very carefully watching our content growth -- content cost growth. And we reaffirmed, as you heard earlier, our targets, our guidance on both subs and on profitability. So we think they move together. It's obviously a balancing act, but we believe that great content is going to drive our subs, and those subs then in scale will drive our profitability.
So we don't see them as necessarily counter. We see them as sort of consistent with the overall approach that we've laid out. We're extremely happy with the content that we've got both across the general entertainment option, which frankly is -- you heard that 50% of our subs are families without kids. And so, at the same time, that relative content expenditure is a little cheaper than our typical franchise expenditure on a per-program basis.
So even though we're adding a lot of content both in local, international markets and as well in the general entertainment area, it doesn't come at the per-title level, if you will, that we've been seeing sort of to date on our general franchise films. That said, we're balancing all three. And we're very confident that going forward, we're going to hit both of those sub guidance and profitability guidance by bringing in the cost at a reasonable level relative to their ability to attract and retain our subs.
Hi, Michael. On the parks margins, as Bob said, we feel really good about the consumer demand and what we're seeing in the forward-looking bookings and everything else in the attendance levels. So we feel good about that portion of margins. The one that is more challenging is what we face with inflation.
But we do pay close attention to all the recent inflationary pressures, and it covers everything from merchandise to food and beverage. I'll give you an example of something -- for those, we are actually always looking at mitigating impacts of rising costs. But I'll give you a good example of one that we are executing on, and that is the increased cost in fuel. We have a very robust fuel hedging program at Walt Disney World, and that reduces risk and minimizes volatility, reduces volatility in the cost of fuel.
And so, that -- while we suspended that program while the parks were shut, we have reopened that program and we are doing what we can to minimize the impact on that particular cost. We do have the labor impacts. Rising wages is something everybody is dealing with and a tighter labor market. On the supply chain, our business isn't immune to the global supply chain challenges.
And to the extent we experience any product availability impacts given strong demand that we're seeing, we're working with our suppliers to diversify some of our suppliers, and we're also working with shippers to expedite time to receive those through shipping. But right now, it's very difficult to accurately forecast the potential financial impact due to the fluidity of the situation. But you can trust that we are fully aware of it, and we're working hard to mitigate any pressure on the margins.
From Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Thank you. I have one big question, one multipart. Can you -- with the upfronts coming next week, can you give us some -- any color on how you're thinking about what this year's upfront will be like given changes in measurement, multiple platforms that you're selling across and, of course, the economy? And staying with the theme on -- given your upcoming rollout of the AVOD platform for Disney+, you already have Hulu ad inventory, and as you're adding Disney+, do you think this will grow the pie overall for Disney advertising dollars? Or will this ultimately just drive share shift from traditional broadcast linear? Is it incremental or not? How are you thinking about that? And how much do you think that having an ad-supported service will increase overall TAM for subscribers?
OK. Let's see. I'm going to take the first part first. We're expecting a very positive reaction from advertisers overall.
And as you suggest, this is a combination of our excitement around the Disney+ ad tier. They have been asking for this for years. And we also expect Hulu, as you know, which has been very strong for us at the same time, to be a key contributor of our performance at the upfront this year. The other thing is that sports are going to continue to be in high demand.
And so, with the advertisers, we focused on the right deals that we've made over the past few years, as well as our robust slate of original content shows and studio shows and original content games. In terms of sort of the growing-the-pie idea, we believe that the value proposition of advertising with Disney+ is only enhanced with our addition of an ad-supported tier on Disney+. So we believe it's good for the consumer because it's going to give us another entry price point, but it's also going to be great for the advertisers. Our advertisers increasingly are looking for multiple platforms to reach a broader reach.
And we think that as a company, we're going to provide that given our portfolio of streaming and our linear networks. So I think we're creating more avenues, both for consumer choice and for comprehensive advertising solutions, for our advertising customers at the same time.
From Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Thanks. Just two. Maybe first, Bob, what's holding you back from making ESPN+ a fully a la carte sports network? Disney historically has always been more aggressive in the pivot to streaming than some of the peers. We've already seen some of the peers put a lot of their key sports like the NFL on to streaming.
You talked a lot about how much the bundle is working with Disney+ and Hulu. So just really wondering how you're thinking about all the content you've got on ESPN+ and what it would take to make that fully a la carte and drive the DTC strategy even harder. And then, Christine, I have asked this before, so I'm just going to try again. Of the $32 billion in content spend, any help in sizing maybe how much of that is either general entertainment or local content? Thank you very much.
OK. So as you know, on all of our linear networks, they're huge cash generators for us. So to some extent, we're doing a really good job of chopping down some of the debt that we've had to accumulate due to either acquisition or through the COVID challenge. And so, the hesitancy to move too fast away from those is really a cash flow situation that I think puts our company in a healthier overall situation.
At the same time, we're very conscious of our ability to go more aggressively into the DTC area of ESPN. And so, what we're doing is sort of putting one foot on the dock, if you will, and one foot on the boat right now. But we know that at some point when it's going to be good for our shareholders, we'll be able to fully go into an ESPN DTC offering the way that you described. And we fully believe that there is a business model there for us that's going to enable us to regain growth on ESPN+ in a full DTC expression.
But at that point, obviously, that will have ramifications on immediate cash flow that we get from our legacy linear networks.
OK. Steve, to answer your question on that $32 billion of content spend and where it's going, remember back when we talked about that initially, we talked about it being about one-third in sports. That still remains. And when you think about the balance of that $32 billion, a meaningful amount of it will be enterprisewide content budget that will be dedicated into investments into the general entertainment content that we can leverage across all of our various distribution platforms.
When we say that, we mean linear, theatrical, as well as direct-to-consumer. And as I mentioned earlier, our world-class creative teams are focused on creating content that will drive subscriber growth in targeted segments and deeper engagement across the platform. This includes leveraging our existing intellectual property. Also, we're intent on creating new franchises.
You saw that in Encanto and investing in general entertainment, local language content and sports rights. I just want to -- even though you didn't ask about local language content, I do want to give you some perspective because we haven't provided this previously. But as Bob mentioned, we have about 500 shows in the pipeline for local content outside of the US or English speaking. When you look at that 500, I'll give you some broad breakdowns.
In the Asia Pacific region, including Southeast Asia, of that 500, 140 is in that region. In EMEA, it's 150. In India, it's 100. And in Latin America, it's 200.
Next question is from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Thank you. A couple, if I could. So Bob, first, I guess, when we think about the streaming goal, if we are really looking at 240 million subs at the midpoint, with the new ad-supported streaming service, what proportion of the base do you expect will be on that tier versus normal premium tier, especially given the fact that now you may have to do more than 50 million subs a year to get to that goal given the trend lines for this year? So that would be the first one. And secondly, I don't think Disney has been able to release a movie in China since 2019.
If you could just help us understand what the roadblocks there are and when we could see some change in that process? Thanks.
OK. I'm going to start with China. And the situation there has been very fluid, and as you probably guess, very complicated both from a business standpoint and from a political standpoint. But as you know, we've got a long record of success and a strong fan base for our brands and franchises in this market.
And our most recent releases were Death on the Nile and Encanto. And we'll continue to submit our films for release. And it's worth noting, I think, though, that at the time that we're having some difficulty in getting our films in China that Doctor Strange did extraordinary. We've just crossed $500 million in less than a week without this market.
So we're pretty confident that even without China, if it were to be that we continue to have difficulties in getting titles in there, that it doesn't really preclude our success given the relatively lower take rate that we get on the box office in China than we do across the rest of the world. Christine, do you want to talk about streaming?
Sure. On streaming, right now, we have not disclosed a mix or expected mix of an ad-supported tier. So we don't have any additional details on that product, and that includes pricing as well. But when we expand Disney+ across multiple price points with this new Disney+ ad tier, we are able to reach an even broader audience, and we'll create more avenues for consumer choice.
And this is a consistent theme that you've heard from us, having the consumer be our North Star. We'll continue to evaluate what makes sense for the service, our brand and our core principle of providing consumers with the maximum flexibility and choice. So we expect the advertising revenue we earn will contribute positively to our ARPU as we look to achieve our long-term profitability goals.
Question is from Philip Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
I have a couple of follow-ups, if I can. Thank you. On parks, can you talk about where the parks are -- the US parks are in terms of staffing and cost, as well as the potential for upside or not in those domestic attendance numbers for customers? And then, Bob, if I can go back to your comment on ESPN going all online someday. I think most of us expect us to happen eventually.
Clearly, that will be a huge change in the P&L at both DTC and linear. When that happens, does the overall profitability of the company take a hit for a year or 2? And how does the long-term sports on ESPN+ model work? And what's the structure of that versus what we've seen in the past of a purely linear model? Thanks very much.
Christine, do you want to start with the first question? And then, Bob second.
Sure. On our parks business, we're obviously extremely pleased with our domestic parks operations and how they have come back robustly. But on domestic attendance, we could, but we're choosing to limit attendance using our reservation system. And once again, that goes back to us trying to balance demand and attendance throughout the year, not have days when consumers in the parks aren't enjoying the experience.
So attendance is something that we're controlling, but we're doing it to have a better consumer experience. And some of the things that we've brought back, we will continue to with additional capacity. But some capacity that we just brought back in April were things like the character meet-and-greets at our domestic parks. And we also brought back in April our Nighttime Spectaculars at the Disneyland Resort.
And we'll also be opening a new attraction at Walt Disney World, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at the end of this month on Memorial Day weekend, and that is all new capacity, and we're really looking forward to having our guests experience that.
OK. And on the ESPN question, we're not ready to share the specifics of our model in terms of how long it would take for us to reach profitability on that or the impact that it would have on our linear business. But I would emphasize that we're only going to do it if it's accretive to our shareholder value when it comes time to actually pull the trigger. But I can tell you that it will be the ultimate fan offering that will appeal to super fans that really love sports.
And I think there's nobody but ESPN that, frankly, could actually pull that off. But we don't have a lot of specifics when it comes to structure. But we do believe that because sports is so powerful, in fact, in the last quarter, 46 of the top 50 most viewed programs on linear TV were sports. And obviously, ESPN dominates that.
And I do believe that sports is the third leg of our domestic offerings in terms of our DTC offerings, and right now, that expression is through the bundle. And I think that could become very powerful for us going forward in the future.
From Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Thanks so much for taking the question. So I guess two questions, if I could. Bob, you've continued to suggest a lot of confidence in Disney+ guidance. Can you talk about trends for churn and engagement for Disney+? And I'm not sure if you're willing to share how much of Disney+ viewing is new content versus library, just thinking as more and more new content starts to show up and ramp.
And then, separately, and maybe this is for Christine, Alexia, you'll let me know. But I'm just curious what you think the international fee park margin potential because it peaked at 16% in fiscal '19. I think we're getting a pretty good idea that the domestic theme parks is going to be very, very profitable. But international is still a bit of a mystery.
I know you've got some parks closed and there's some disruption, but you also have a good idea of what you're seeing in the US, how you could apply that overseas and what you've done with the cost structure during the pandemic. And also, if you look back at fiscal '19, sorry for making the question a little bit longer, but Hong Kong was shut down for part of the year; China was, what, in year three. So I'm just curious if those international margins, do we think about the getting closer and closer to US margins over time? Thanks so much.
Bob, why don't you take the first half and then Christine can follow up on parks.
OK. In terms of our confidence in Disney+ guidance, as you probably know, we have a tremendous amount of data that we get on our DCC platforms, things like the first view, what's the first view that somebody watches when they first come on to our platform, which is a pretty good proxy for maybe why they signed up. There's also the amount of time spent, the engagement scores and then, of course, the churn, information that you sort of look at. And we've said this before in past earnings calls, but we're extraordinarily pleased with the low churn that we see, particularly given the bundle.
The bundle is really efficient in terms of churn. And that gives us a lot of bullishness when it comes to the idea of bigger offerings from Disney. So as we sort of take each of these elements, when we get a new piece of content, we'll look at first view, we'll look at engagement, we'll look at the amount of time they spend on it. And we can model.
We can do a lot of modeling. And that modeling suggests that in addition to things like local market content, new content coming online, both in terms of general entertainment and from franchises, as well as new markets being added that that Disney+ guidance is going to be very achievable for us both in terms of the sub adds and in terms of the operating performance.
OK. On international theme parks, Doug, on Asia, I think it's really too early for us to tell. And as you heard in my comments, we said that we could see a negative impact of Hong Kong and Shanghai of $350 million in the next quarter, so just keep that in mind. But it is a bit of a tale of two cities.
I can give you some very positive trends we're seeing out of Disneyland Paris. So just like domestically, we're seeing very strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris. And we're looking forward to its continued recovery, particularly with the recent launch of their 30th anniversary celebration. Avengers Campus, that's the first new themed area of our multiyear expansion that we've talked about previously for DLP, that will open this summer.
And what has already opened is the -- one of our large hotels over there, the New York Hotel, has been rethemed in a Marvel theme and Avengers theme. So that's very exciting. And our guests love staying there. So I think what we're seeing in Paris gives me hope.
Hope is not a strategy, but it gives me hope that our other parks in Asia will see that same rebound when their COVID-related headwinds abate.
If I could just follow up, maybe the simple way to put it is, you've talked about the potential for higher park margins than previous peak. Would that apply to both domestic parks, and separately, international parks longer term?
Well, Doug, we've said it for domestic. We're not going to update that for international. There's just too much uncertainty with the region in Asia that has two of our parks right now.
All right. Thanks so much.
Operator we have time for one more question.
Thank you. From Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. I have a couple on this advertising tier we're talking about for Disney+. My first is, can you share anything else on what remains to be done prior to the rollout, the implementation of that advertising tier? Are there assets you need to acquire? Or what are you building or anything like that given the pieces that you do already have in place through your ownership of Hulu, etc.? So I'm curious about the advertising infrastructure.
And then, the second, you touched on this a little bit, Christine, but I'm curious if you can share any more relative sizing of the ARPU potential of the ad-supported service. Given that Disney+ is still half the price of Netflix domestically, I'm curious if ad-supported ARPU could actually be higher than where you are right now and if this does present a catalyst for you to raise price on the ad-free service. Thank you.
Bob, why don't you start and then Christine can finish.
OK. We're in really good shape in terms of being able to meet our timing with our Disney+ ad tier. And that's largely because we're already doing it. The combination of our ESPN+, streaming tech stack and our experience in Hulu and the software, we think that our current advertising capabilities really substantially prepare us to already bring this tier into operations.
So there's nothing that we need to go acquire or, frankly, even in any significant way developing anything new. And that's due to the ongoing investments in technology that we've made over time to increasingly automate much of this process. And we've been looking forward to this for a while. So this is something that's well-greased, if you will.
And our teams are hard at work at making that become a reality.
So on the incremental information you had touched pm our ad-supported tier. At this time, we haven't announced a price point for it. So we're not going to do that today. But we will continue to evaluate what makes sense for the service in terms of pricing.
And I will say that you can look to our experience with Hulu and their ad-supported tier. We believe that this will contribute to ARPU. And we look at it as certainly something additive that will work toward achieving our long-term profitability goals.

**The Walt Disney Company's Q2 2022 Financial Results Conference Call**

Thank you for joining us for The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2022 financial results conference call. Our press release was issued approximately 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at [www.disney.com/investors](http://www.disney.com/investors).

Joining me today are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer, and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following their comments, we will be happy to take your questions.

**Bob Chapek's Remarks**

Good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, Disney's employees and cast members continued to execute against our strategic priorities of storytelling excellence, innovation, and audience focus. Our strong results this quarter, including fantastic performance at our domestic parks and continued growth at our streaming services, along with the creative achievements of our content teams, once again proved that we are in a league of our own.

Our domestic parks were a standout, with strong demand and customized guest experiences driving per capita spending up more than 40% versus 2019. Response to next-generation storytelling like Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser has been phenomenal. In fact, guest ratings for this immersive experience, which opened March 1, are incredibly high and in line with our best-in-class offerings. Demand is strong, and we expect 100% utilization through the end of Q3.

Our streaming services also had a strong quarter, with over 205 million total subscriptions, including 7.9 million Disney+ subscribers. We believe Disney+ is one of a kind, a service based on exceptional branded content with wide appeal across all four quadrants. Our strategy is not just to fill our distribution pipelines but to be thoughtful with each asset to best position it among our various distribution options.

Investors have several ways to potentially profit from this tremendous growth. You could invest in specific marijuana stocks, but another alternative is to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on cannabis.
The main benefit of buying marijuana ETFs is that your money is spread across a basket of stocks, which can lower your risk compared to investing in only a few individual stocks. Here's what you need to know about the top marijuana ETFs on the market.
Below are nine top marijuana ETFs ranked by assets under management.
The largest marijuana ETF based on assets under management is the AdvisorShares Pure U.S. Cannabis ETF (MSOS  -2.31%). It's the first ETF to focus exclusively on the U.S. cannabis market.
AdvisorShares Pure U.S. Cannabis ETF currently owns 26 U.S. marijuana stocks. Its top holdings include Green Thumb Industries (GTBIF  -2.8%), Curaleaf Holdings (CURLF  1.07%), Trulieve Cannabis (TCNNF  -5.76%), Verano Holdings (VRNO.F  -2.66%), and Terrascend (TRSSF  0.07%). Together, the five U.S. cannabis operators make up more than 78% of the ETF's total portfolio.
It's possible that the ETF's concentration on the U.S. market could give investors greater growth opportunities than other ETFs. Although marijuana remains illegal at the federal level in the U.S., many states have legalized marijuana for medical and/or recreational use.
In 2015, ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ  -2.28%) became the first ETF to target the global cannabis market. This ETF was established even before the Canadian cannabis industry took off after the legalization of recreational marijuana in 2018.
ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF currently owns 34 individual stocks. Its top holdings include Tilray Brands (TLRY  -4.06%), Canopy Growth (CGC  -6.09%), Cronos Group (CRON  -0.93%), SNDL (SNDL  -4.29%), and Chicago Atlantic Real Estate Finance (REFI  -1.46%). The five positions combined make up close to 26% of the ETF's total assets.
Canadian cannabis producers weigh heavily in the ETF's portfolio. This could hurt the ETF's performance while current U.S. federal cannabis laws remain in effect. The Canadian companies can't enter the U.S. cannabis market and retain their listings on major U.S. stock exchanges as long as marijuana is illegal at the federal level.
ETFMG U.S. Alternative Harvest ETF is one of the newest marijuana ETFs and was launched in 2021. As its name indicates, the fund focuses on U.S. cannabis companies.
The ETF currently owns 29 individual stocks. Its top holdings include Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR  -0.8%), Green Thumb Industries, Trulieve Cannabis, Curaleaf Holdings, and Verano Holdings. The positions make up almost 66% of the total portfolio.
The fund also is invested heavily in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, which currently offer attractive yields. Treasuries make up more than 44% of its total portfolio.
Although Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF (HMLSF  0.36%) isn't listed on a major U.S. stock exchange, U.S. investors can buy the ETF on over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Its 2017 inception makes it one of the oldest marijuana ETFs.
The ETF holds positions in 27 marijuana stocks. Its top holdings include Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ  -1.42%), ScottsMiracle-Gro (SMG  3.68%), Innovative Industrial Properties, Cronos Group, and Tilray. Together, these five stocks represent more than 68% of the ETF's total portfolio.
Like all marijuana ETFs, Horizons Marijuana Life S) became the first ETF to target the global cannabis market. The ETF was established even before the Canadian cannabis industry took off after the legalization of recreational marijuana in 2018.
AdvisorShares operates two marijuana ETFs. One focuses exclusively on the U.S. cannabis market, but the AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (YOLO  -2.76%) doesn't limit itself to the U.S. Instead, it focuses on the global cannabis market.
The ETF currently has 24 holdings. Almost 49% of its assets are invested in the AdvisorShares Pure U.S. Cannabis ETF. The top five individual stocks in its portfolio are Village Farms International (VFF  -4.59%), Tilray, High Tide (HITI  -4.89%), Jazz Pharmaceuticals, and Innovative Industrial Properties. The stocks make up more than 27% of the ETF's total holdings.
The AdvisorShares ETF could be an attractive alternative to investors who want exposure outside of the U.S. but still want a heavier weighting to U.S. stocks.
Global X Cannabis ETF (POTX  -0.77%) is operated by Mirae Asset, a financial services company based in South Korea. As its name indicates, the ETF focuses on the global cannabis industry.
There are currently 16 individual stocks in the Global X Cannabis ETF portfolio. Its top holdings include Innovative Industrial Properties, Tilray Brands, Canopy Growth, Cronos Group, and AFC Gamma (AFCG  -2.64%). The stocks combined make up more than 59% of the ETF's assets.
The ETF contains both U.S. and Canadian cannabis stocks, providing investors exposure to the cannabis markets in both countries.
Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF (CNBS  -3.6%) bears the name of its manager, Tim Seymour. He is a well-known cannabis investor and has appeared frequently on CNBC's Fast Money TV show.
The ETF currently holds positions in 34 stocks. Its top holdings include Green Thumb Industries, Tilray Brands, Curaleaf Holdings, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, and Trulieve Cannabis. The five stocks comprise more than 40% of the ETF's total assets.
U.S. marijuana stocks make up eight of the top 10 positions held by the Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF and 65% of its total portfolio. Most of the remaining portfolio consists of Canadian pot stocks with a small percentage invested in the stocks of cannabis companies based in Ireland and Israel.
The Cannabis ETF (THCX  -3.04%) began trading in July 2019. It focuses on stocks that could benefit from growth in both the hemp and legal marijuana industries.
The ETF currently owns 23 stocks. Its top positions include Nova Cannabis (NASDAQ:NOVC), AFC Gamma, Fire & Flower Holdings (FFLW.F  -44.37%), OrganiGram Holdings (OGI  -4.7%), and PerkinElmer (NYSE:PKI). Together, the five stocks make up almost 33% of total assets.
Probably the biggest knock against The Cannabis ETF is its relatively high expense ratio of 0.75%.
The continued legalization of marijuana means growth for companies in this sector.
It turns out that ""magic mushrooms"" may have medical applications.
These companies create drugs and treatments for some of the biggest medical problems of our time.
Healthcare is a universal need. Companies in this broad-based sector can produce healthy returns.
Cambria Cannabis ETF is operated by Mebane Faber's Cambria Investment Management. Like The Cannabis ETF, it launched in July 2019.
The ETF typically owns between 20 and 50 cannabis stocks. It currently holds positions in 35 stocks. The top holdings include Constellation Brands (STZ  -1.35%), Imperial Brands (OTC:IMMBY), Jazz Pharmaceuticals, ScottsMiracle-Gro, and Philip Morris International (PM  -0.24%). The five stocks combined make up almost 39% of total assets.
Although Cambria Cannabis ETF provides exposure to U.S. marijuana stocks, it doesn't own any of the leading multi-state operators. However, it offers the lowest expense ratio of the top marijuana ETFs.

Below are the best-performing cannabis ETFs available to U.S. investors (excluding the over-the-counter market). It’s important to remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, but looking at a fund’s recent price movements often provides a good place to start your search. For a deeper dive, look into the fund's three-year or five-year returns (if it's old enough to have them) to see how the fund has performed over longer periods.

There are hundreds of cannabis stocks to choose from, many of them risky penny stocks or stocks of companies with extremely small market capitalizations. Given the industry’s young age, there’s ample room for shakeout that could significantly affect a stock’s price. There will likely be many losers, and it’s hard to predict the number of potential winners. The current state of the industry makes an already risky strategy — picking individual stocks — even riskier.
Marijuana ETFs still come with considerable risk, but you’ll at least broaden your exposure to dozens of companies. If one company in the fund fails, ideally those losses will be offset by another company’s success. It’s true that you could miss out on the sky-high returns of an individual breakout stock, but investing in cannabis ETFs could help you avoid the significant losses investors are likely to see in such an unproven industry.
Investing in cannabis — including cannabis ETFs — comes with considerable risk. Regulatory uncertainty, financing hurdles and sheer unpredictability in business models and operations could significantly and quickly alter the future landscape, and in turn, the value of marijuana stocks and ETFs.
While recreational marijuana consumption and possession is now legal in several states (and medical marijuana is legal in even more), in the eyes of the federal government, it’s still a Schedule 1 drug. This designation, which puts marijuana in the same category as heroin, ecstasy and LSD, suggests it has no medical value and a high rate of abuse.
This classification can lead to gray areas between state and federal laws. For example, the U.S. attorney general has the power to decide whether the Justice Department will enforce federal marijuana laws within states that have passed legalization laws, and this stance has already shifted from one presidential administration to the next. As long as enforcement is fluid, uncertainty will persist.
While the earliest dispensaries and marijuana businesses may have struggled to find traditional financing and banking services, that isn’t as big of a concern today, and more change could be on the horizon.
In 2019, the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act of 2019 passed in the House. If it becomes law, it would help protect depository institutions that supply financial services to marijuana companies. Moreover, the National Credit Union Administration issued interim guidance in 2019 to help credit unions navigate how to provide services to legal hemp businesses. This guidance was in response to the 2018 Farm Bill, which delisted hemp (which, in this context, means a marijuana plant containing less than 0.3% of the psychoactive ingredient THC) as a controlled substance at the federal level.
On top of all that, the number of depository institutions that provide banking services to marijuana companies has risen steadily since 2014, reaching 553 banks and 162 credit unions by the third quarter of 2019, up from about 100 banks and a handful of credit unions five years earlier.
Still, many of these developments aren't yet concrete. While they suggest legislation favorable to the marijuana industry could be forthcoming, the landscape is still being formed, which will likely result in continued uncertainty in the short term.
Since its 2015 inception, the U.S. Marijuana Index — which tracks the leading cannabis stocks in the country — has enjoyed both high times and harsh comedowns. As of July 7, the index’s 52-week high is 105.19; the 52-week low is 19.91.
If you’re a new investor or are looking for predictability, there are other index funds and ETFs better suited for you. But if you’re willing to stomach the volatility of an uncertain market in exchange for getting in at an extremely early stage — and your portfolio is in a well-diversified, healthy state — you may have a case for investing in cannabis ETFs.

**The $197.7 Billion Cannabis Industry: How to Invest and Avoid Lifestyle Creep**

The cannabis industry is expected to reach a staggering $197.7 billion by 2028, according to Fortune Business Insights. With a compound annual growth rate of 32%, investors are eager to tap into this tremendous growth opportunity. But while investing in cannabis stocks can be lucrative, it's essential to avoid lifestyle creep, a common pitfall that can derail even the best investment strategies.

**Lifestyle Creep: The Silent Wealth Killer**

Lifestyle creep occurs when your expenses increase in lockstep with your income, making it difficult to save and invest for the future. This phenomenon can happen to anyone, regardless of income level. Even high earners, with salaries ranging from $100,000 to $500,000, often struggle to save enough, citing lifestyle creep as a major obstacle.

**Investing in Cannabis ETFs: A Smart Way to Diversify**

Instead of investing in individual cannabis stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a diversification strategy that can help reduce risk. Here are nine top marijuana ETFs ranked by assets under management:

1. **AdvisorShares Pure U.S. Cannabis ETF (MSOS)**: The largest marijuana ETF, focusing exclusively on the U.S. cannabis market.
2. **ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ)**: The first ETF to target the global cannabis market, with a significant weighting towards Canadian cannabis producers.
3. **ETFMG U.S. Alternative Harvest ETF**: A newer ETF focusing on U.S. cannabis companies, with a heavier weighting towards short-term U.S. Treasury bonds.
4. **Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF (HMLSF)**: One of the oldest marijuana ETFs, listed on the over-the-counter (OTC) markets.
5. **AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (YOLO)**: A global cannabis ETF that doesn't limit itself to the U.S. market.
6. **Global X Cannabis ETF (POTX)**: A global cannabis ETF operated by Mirae Asset, a financial services company based in South Korea.
7. **Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF (CNBS)**: A cannabis ETF managed by Tim Seymour, a well-known cannabis investor.
8. **The Cannabis ETF (THCX)**: A newer ETF focusing on stocks that could benefit from growth in both the hemp and legal marijuana industries.
9. **Cambria Cannabis ETF**: A broadly diversified ETF that provides exposure to U.S. marijuana stocks, with a low expense ratio.

**Avoiding Lifestyle Creep: Strategies for Success**

To avoid lifestyle creep, it's essential to create a financial plan and budget, and stick to it. Here are some strategies to help you keep your expenses in check:

* Create a budget that accounts for your essential expenses, savings, and investments.
* Set up automatic transfers to your investment accounts to ensure consistent investing.
* Avoid overspending on housing, keeping costs below 25% of your net income.
* Pay yourself a weekly allowance to remain intentional about your spending.

By investing in cannabis ETFs and avoiding lifestyle creep, you can set yourself up for financial success in this growing industry.

**The Rise of Cannabis ETFs: A Growing Opportunity for Investors**

The global cannabis market is projected to reach $197.7 billion by 2028, growing at a staggering compound annual growth rate of 32%. As the industry expands, investors are seeking ways to capitalize on this growth. One way to do so is by investing in cannabis-themed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These ETFs offer a diversified portfolio of cannabis stocks, spreading risk and providing exposure to the growing industry.

**Top Cannabis ETFs: A Closer Look**

We've compiled a list of the top cannabis ETFs, ranked by assets under management. Here's a breakdown of each fund:

2. **ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ)**: As the first ETF to target the global cannabis market, this fund owns 34 individual stocks, with a heavy weighting towards Canadian cannabis producers.

9. **Cambria Cannabis ETF**: This ETF typically owns between 20 and 50 cannabis stocks, with a focus on U.S. marijuana companies.

**Key Considerations for Investors**

When investing in cannabis ETFs, it's essential to consider the following:

* **Concentration risk**: Many cannabis ETFs have a high concentration of stocks in a few large companies, which can increase risk.
* **Expense ratios**: Cannabis ETFs often have higher expense ratios compared to other ETFs, which can eat into returns.
* **Global exposure**: Some ETFs focus on the global cannabis market, while others focus on U.S. or Canadian companies.
* **Diversification**: Cannabis ETFs can provide diversification benefits, but it's essential to consider the overall portfolio risk.

**Investing in Cannabis ETFs: A Growing Opportunity**

The cannabis industry is growing rapidly, and cannabis ETFs offer a way to invest in this growth. However, it's crucial to carefully consider the risks and benefits of each ETF before investing. As with any investment, it's essential to have a long-term perspective and a solid understanding of the underlying holdings.","Here is the style guide in JSON format, based on the analysis of the reference documents:

0.589285714285714,"Square is a great entry-level, affordable point-of-sale (POS) system for small businesses such as restaurants and retailers. With free credit card readers and a user-friendly interface, Square lets you collect payments in-store and on the road with minimal fuss and expense.
But is Square the best option for your business? Whether you want to upgrade from Square or evaluate your options before investing in a POS system, here are alternatives to consider.
Square gets high marks for easy setup, free hardware, and simple operation. It does have limitations, though. Here's what to look for in a Square alternative.
The Square app is free and there are no monthly fees or minimum charges. Instead, Square charges a flat fee of 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction for in-person charges, including swiped (magnetic stripe), dipped (chip), and tapped (mobile) credit card payments.
Square fees for online payments are 2.9% + $0.30, and transactions that are manually keyed in cost 3.5% + $0.15. Square's invoice fee is also 2.9% + $0.30 unless the payment is made with a card on file, which costs 3.5% + $0.15.
Across the board, Square's pricing is on par with other POS providers, but Square credit card processing can be costly for businesses that process a lot of charges under $10, called micropayments.
The system includes a free Square credit card reader that accepts swipe payments. A reader that handles both contactless (tap) and chip (dip) card transactions is available for $49.
If you're considering alternatives to Square, you need to evaluate pricing and how the charges will add up for your sales volume and typical charges.
Square offers basic support with live customer service available only on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Pacific time. If you're investing in a new POS system, look for one with support covering critical evening and weekend hours.
Square offers basic POS features such as inventory management and sales analytics, but many POS systems have much richer tracking and reporting capabilities.
Here are our top suggestions to consider in place of Square for payment processing.
Stripe is a family of web-based POS solutions that integrate with existing websites and applications. Stripe Terminal is a versatile POS terminal solution ideal for businesses that want control over the customer's purchasing journey from end to end, but it takes web development savvy to make it all work.
If you have coding expertise in-house, Stripe is a powerhouse payment solution for online and mobile payments. It includes an embedded checkout on your website that can be branded and customized to your precise specifications.
Stripe comes packed with pre-built integrations with just about every backend system you might use, from website builders to customer relations management (CRM) to inventory and sales management.
Stripe's fee for online payments is the same as Square's, but its POS fee for in-person card payments is 2.7% + $0.05 per transaction. If you process a lot of small payments, this might be advantageous for you.
If you want more features, better support, and competitive pricing, Stripe is worth a look.
Toast POS is designed for restaurants, with thoughtful features for managing digital orders, front-of-house and back-of-house tasks, sales tracking, and customer engagement. For example, Toast's sales reports drill down to sales by item to inform purchasing and pricing strategies. They also break down sales by employee to inform staffing and performance management.
Toast also supports popular marketing elements such as gift cards and loyalty programs. The system integrates with approximately 60 third-party software programs. This is fewer than many competing POS systems, but it includes specialty providers such as Grubhub.
Toast's POS pricing is $75/month for software to support one register. Its payment processing fees are determined individually, but are in the range of 2.5% + $0.15 per transaction. There are additional fees for specific features and hardware.
Toast has many useful features baked in for food services, plus excellent support and user-friendly software. If you're in the restaurant business, Toast should make your short list for POS software.
Lightspeed POS includes two solutions created for retailers and restaurateurs. It's not the lowest cost option, but Lightspeed offers rich features for the money.
Lightspeed POS lets you upload your inventory via spreadsheet or even directly from vendor catalogs. From there, you can sort, tag, and track items and automate restocking to maintain inventory. Lightspeed also includes advanced purchase order management features.
Lightspeed Restaurant offers menu management, ingredient tracking, floor plan management, and reporting and analytics. Lightspeed's customer loyalty feature lets you collect and track customer information to create targeted marketing campaigns.
Lightspeed accepts multiple payment types including credit cards, checks, and gift cards. The software is easy to use and provides outstanding 24/7 customer support.
Lightspeed offers five monthly subscription plans ranging from $69 to $299/month depending on the add-ons you choose. If you own a store or restaurant, check out Lightspeed before settling on a POS. Lightspeed offers a 14-day free trial, so there's nothing to lose.
Shopkeep, a Square alternative, is another competitive offering for retail and food service businesses. ShopKeep is easy to use straight out of the box, with sales, customer, and inventory management handled through a single dashboard.
ShopKeep's inventory management feature is tailored for small businesses, letting you group inventory by variants for easier viewing and automatic restocking. For example, if you sell a sandwich, ShopKeep will deduct the appropriate stock from your stores of bread, cheese, and meat.
ShopKeep's register function is equally well thought out, giving you advanced capabilities in a simple, user-friendly interface. With ShopKeep, you get all the tools you need to run a store or restaurant without complexity.
Shopkeep's pricing depends on your volume and other factors, but the company offers a free plan for businesses with a single register, location, and staff member and sales of less than $5,000 per month.
All of ShopKeep's plans come with 24/7 support via email, text, live chat, and a knowledge hub. With all that, ShopKeep has a lot to offer small shops and restaurants.
Shopify POS is a major competitor in e-commerce and payment processing, and the company's POS system doesn't disappoint. If you're already using Shopify online, it's easy to add Shopify POS to your sales system.
Shopify provides powerful sales, inventory, customer, and employee management tools and financial analytics, all from a single interface. This includes advanced reporting on everything from best and worst sellers to inventory turnover ratio. As an example of the depth of Shopify's offerings, the inventory management tool features alone integrate with more than 100 apps.
Shopify offers five pricing tiers starting from $9/month with a free card reader. Fees are 2.7% for card reader payments and 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction for online payments. All plans come with 24/7 support via email and chat, but phone support could be better.
Revel POS is an iOS-based POS solution designed for restaurants with systems specifically geared toward coffee and pizza shops. A general retail solution is also available.
Revel includes features for front-of-house operations such as order management and back-of-house tasks such as inventory management and sales analysis. Its POS interface is simple and easy to use, with a main dashboard that incorporates customer management, time clock, reports, and inventory.
Revel's analytics are excellent. Its inventory management tools let you analyze inventory turnover rates, holding costs, gross profit calculations, forecasting, and more. Sales reports are equally robust, with breakdowns by customer, payment method, employee, and more.
Revel is easy to use, but customer support receives mixed marks. And it’s incompatible with Android devices.
Revel's pricing, based on an annual subscription fee of $1,188/terminal with unlimited users, provides advanced reporting. Payment processing is quoted individually, and onboarding starts at $649. One advantage of Revel is that you can use your own iOS hardware.
PayPal Here is a mobile app that combines payment processing with basic retail management tools. It is a good solution for businesses that need to take payments anywhere, from any smartphone or tablet.
PayPal Here is a simple, quick, and trusted payment option. It accepts payments via a PayPal account, Venmo, PayPal Credit, or credit and debit cards. PayPal can also provide online payment processing through a PayPal button on your website.

The business account includes basic inventory tracking, customer management, and staff management tools. Its dashboards and reports also provide customized performance and sales analytics.
PayPal Here is a tested, out-of-the-box solution that can manage all of your payment processing needs from any device or location. Support includes a help center, live chat, in-app help, and phone support.
PayPal provides quick access to sales revenue and straightforward pricing at 2.7% for card payments, 2.9% + $0.30 per online transaction, and 3.5% + $0.15 for keyed transactions. If you qualify to take payments under $10, you'll pay a fee of 5% + $0.05 per transaction in U.S. dollars.
Epos Now is another POS system designed for businesses in the retail, restaurant, and hospitality space. Epos caters to the unique needs of hospitality businesses with features such as table layouts, master products, split bills, online booking, and loyalty systems.
Epos Now's POS solution accepts payments via global processing partners. It includes helpful add-ons such as custom receipts that incorporate customer loyalty information. Its inventory management tools include barcode scanning and automatic restocking.
The system provides extensive reports to monitor sales and financial performance from a single dashboard. You can access your dashboard from any device via website or app. You can also customize your dashboard to track key performance indicators (KPIs) of your choice.

Epos is worth a look for restaurants, bars, gyms, hotels, and other hospitality businesses. A free 30-day trial means you can take Epos Now for a spin risk-free.
Clover POS is also tailored to meet the needs of restaurants. It has a higher sticker price than many of the other POS systems featured here, but it is highly customizable and well suited to the needs of restaurants with table or counter service.
Besides processing credit card payments, Clover POS includes helpful features that make running your restaurant easier. With Clover's Register app, for example, you can customize orders to add bacon or put the dressing on the side and automatically adjust charges to match.
Clover also provides customer accounts complete with photos, allergy information, loyalty points, and other key stats so you can treat every customer like a VIP.
Clover's sales reporting and performance analytics are equally impressive. The system allows access to an array of apps from Clover and other providers for managing everything from payroll to bar tabs.
Clover POS is easy to use, but pricing is more complicated. The system requires Clover hardware, which starts with a smartphone card reader, Clover Go, at $69. You'll also pay for a register plan, which starts at $14/month, plus transaction fees of 2.7% + $0.10 for in-person credit card payments or 3.5% + $0.10 for keyed-in sales. Additional register fees apply.
Clover POS isn't the cheapest, but it is definitely among the more powerful POS solutions for restaurants. Customer support is not a strong point, however. Because of that, and the company's complex pricing, Clover warrants careful examination before signing on.
Your go-to accounting software company, QuickBooks, offers a POS solution that might be a good fit for businesses that want a tight integration with their bookkeeping system.
QuickBooks POS is the only system featured here that’s locally installed rather than cloud-based. That might be a non-starter for many, but QuickBooks POS works for a lot of businesses.
QuickBooks is designed for brick-and-mortar stores with straightforward POS needs, but it’s not ideal for stores with online sales.
The QuickBooks system includes checkout and payment processing, inventory management, and customer management as well as robust financial reporting. The system is easy to set up and use.
QuickBooks offers three tiers of pricing beginning at $960 for a one-time license purchase. Hardware such as card readers and tablets must be purchased separately. Payment processing fees are also covered by separate plans including a pay-as-you-go option and monthly subscription options.
QuickBooks offers a 30-day free trial, so if you're intrigued by integrating POS with your existing accounting software, it might be worth a look.
Your POS system is the nerve center of your business. With so many choices available, it makes sense to do your research and due diligence before investing in a system. Talk to a sales rep, take a test drive, and consider the payment structures carefully before deciding, and your POS should serve you well as you manage and grow your business.

0.561643835616438,"IRAs are tax-advantaged retirement accounts that accept pre-tax contributions. With traditional IRAs, account holders pay taxes on withdrawals. Sometimes those who own IRAs pass away before withdrawing all the money in an account, which means their heirs can inherit it. For those heirs, it may come as a shock to discover that you must pay taxes on an inherited IRA.
Taxes on an inherited IRA are due when the money is withdrawn from the account and taxed at your ordinary income tax rates. Taxes are typically due only on a traditional IRA, not on a Roth IRA (as long as the Roth IRA was open for at least five years).
However, you can't just leave the money invested in the traditional IRA indefinitely and avoid owing taxes. There are rules for when you'll need to make withdrawals and pay taxes. You must follow them to avoid penalties and should consider your withdrawal schedule carefully, as taking too much money out of an inherited traditional IRA could bump you into a higher tax bracket and raise your marginal tax rate.
The rules for how long you can wait to withdraw money from an inherited IRA vary depending on whether you inherit from a spouse or from a person you are not married to. The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act limited withdrawal options for most nonspouse heirs.
The government provides tax breaks for investing in an IRA to encourage retirement savings. But while account holders can contribute to their accounts with pre-tax dollars and allow money in their IRAs to grow tax-free, the government eventually wants its piece of the pie.
To make sure the money in an IRA is taxed eventually, the original account holder must begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) starting at age 72. But if the account holder dies prior to all the money being withdrawn, the government still wants to make sure taxes are paid on gains. As a result, it requires those who inherit to also take the money out within an acceptable timeline and to pay taxes when they do.
An inherited IRA is considered part of a deceased person's estate. That means that if the estate is large enough, it's possible it will owe estate taxes on the value of an IRA. Estate taxes are assessed on the federal level only on very large estates, but some states impose estate taxes at lower levels. The estate pays estate taxes, and rates vary depending on the size of the estate.
Those who inherit an IRA and who take distributions from it are taxed on the withdrawn income at their ordinary tax rate, regardless of whether the estate was subject to estate tax or not. However, when you take distributions, you may be entitled to an income tax deduction for estate taxes paid on the IRA, which can offset some of the IRA income and lower your tax bill.
If you're using the wrong credit or debit card, it could be costing you serious money. Our experts love this top pick, which features a 0% intro APR for 15 months, an insane cash back rate of up to 5%, and all somehow for no annual fee. In fact, this card is so good that our experts use it personally. Click here to read our full review for free and apply in just 2 minutes.
The SECURE Act, which was signed into law in 2020, changed the rules for taxes on inherited IRAs for most nonspouse beneficiaries. Previously, those who inherited had the option to stretch out distributions from the IRA over their life expectancy. Now most beneficiaries must withdraw all funds from the inherited IRA within 10 years.
Since distributions are taxed at ordinary income tax rates, this change to the rule now ensures inherited IRA funds will be taxed within a decade when not inherited by a spouse. There are limited exceptions to this rule for ""eligible designated beneficiaries,"" which include the spouse and minor children of the original IRA account owner, heirs who are less than 10 years younger than the original account holder, and disabled or chronically ill heirs.
The eligible designated beneficiary can also have the option to make withdrawals based on their life expectancy.
You must follow the rules for withdrawing money from an inherited IRA, or you could incur a 50% penalty on the funds you didn't take out at the proper time. That means that while you have options for waiting to pay taxes -- such as waiting until the end of the 10-year allowable period -- you have a strict deadline to comply with.
You may not want to wait to take out money at the last possible date, though, as this could result in a large distribution in a single tax year. This could increase your taxable income enough to push you into a higher tax bracket, thus raising taxes due on the entire amount. Instead you may prefer to take out more money in years when your taxable income is lower so the distribution is taxed at a lower rate, or you may decide to spread out the withdrawal over the entire period so you can pay taxes on the inherited IRA over time.
Inherited IRAs still are subject to required minimum distributions. Learn the rules here.

If the will asks for “cash on hand” to be distributed among family members, this does not include the IRA account. Under no circumstances would you be required to provide the executor with the proceeds from the IRA.
The beneficiary designation, assuming it names you directly, supersedes any provision in the will. Even if the will states that an IRA rollover or an IRA should be left to the estate, the beneficiary designation takes precedence.
The designation of a primary beneficiary for an IRA or 401(k) is very important. Whether you want to leave your IRA account to your spouse or your children, you must designate them as beneficiaries. You should also keep your IRA and 401(k) beneficiary list up to date as your family circumstances change.
IRAs and inherited IRAs are tax-deferred accounts. That means that tax is paid when the holder of an IRA account or the beneficiary takes distributions—in the case of an inherited IRA account. IRA distributions are considered income and, as such, are subject to applicable taxes.1 If the will refers to “cash on hand” to be distributed among family members, IRA distributions would not be considered cash on hand.
“Cash on hand refers to readily accessible cash, and since IRA distributions are taxable, I would personally not include that in cash on hand,” said Adam Harding, a financial advisor in Scottsdale, Arizona.
In the case of inherited IRAs, the primary beneficiary designation takes precedence over any directions in the will. If the executor of the estate asks the IRA primary beneficiary to hand over the IRA back to the estate, that is not a proper action to take. You, as a primary beneficiary, have all the rights to inherit your ancestor’s IRA.
If you were to actually cash out the inherited IRA and give it to the estate, you would pay taxes. “If you should cash in [the] IRA and hand it over to her estate, you would be forced to pay taxes on it on top of losing your inheritance,” said Arie Korving, a financial advisor with Korving & Company in Suffolk, Virginia.

Tax Implications of Inherited IRAs

Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) offer tax advantages to encourage retirement savings. Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, and the money grows tax-free. However, the government eventually wants its share of the pie. Traditional IRA account holders must pay taxes when they withdraw the funds, usually at their ordinary income tax rate.

When an IRA owner passes away, the beneficiaries inherit the account. Unfortunately, they must also pay taxes on the inherited IRA. The rules for withdrawing money from an inherited IRA vary depending on whether the beneficiary is a spouse or not. The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act limited withdrawal options for most non-spouse beneficiaries.

Taxes on an inherited IRA are due when the money is withdrawn, and taxed at the beneficiary's ordinary income tax rate. This applies to traditional IRAs, not Roth IRAs (as long as the Roth IRA was open for at least five years). The beneficiary cannot leave the money invested indefinitely to avoid taxes. There are rules for when withdrawals must be made, and failing to comply may result in penalties.

Taxes on Inherited IRAs: Understanding the Rules

Inheriting an IRA can be a significant windfall, but it also comes with tax implications. The government eventually wants its share of the pie, and beneficiaries must navigate the rules to avoid penalties and minimize their tax burden.

IRAs are tax-advantaged retirement accounts that accept pre-tax contributions. Traditional IRAs, in particular, require account holders to pay taxes on withdrawals. When the original account holder passes away, beneficiaries inherit the IRA and must pay taxes on the inherited amount.

Taxation of Inherited IRAs

Taxes on inherited IRAs are due when the money is withdrawn from the account and are taxed at the beneficiary's ordinary income tax rate. This applies to traditional IRAs, not Roth IRAs, which are funded with after-tax dollars. The rules for withdrawing money from an inherited IRA vary depending on whether you inherit from a spouse or a non-spouse beneficiary.

The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act, signed into law in 2020, limited withdrawal options for most non-spouse beneficiaries. Previously, beneficiaries could stretch out distributions from the IRA over their life expectancy. Now, most beneficiaries must withdraw all funds from the inherited IRA within 10 years.

Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

The original account holder must begin taking RMDs starting at age 72. If the account holder dies prior to withdrawing all the money, the beneficiary must also take RMDs within an acceptable timeline. Failure to comply with the rules can result in a 50% penalty on the funds not withdrawn.

Estate Taxes

An inherited IRA is considered part of the deceased person's estate. If the estate is large enough, it may owe estate taxes on the value of the IRA. Estate taxes are assessed on the federal level only on very large estates, but some states impose estate taxes at lower levels. The estate pays estate taxes, and rates vary depending on the size of the estate.

When beneficiaries take distributions from the IRA, they may be entitled to an income tax deduction for estate taxes paid on the IRA, which can offset some of the IRA income and lower their tax bill.

Inherited IRA Strategies

Beneficiaries have options for withdrawing money from an inherited IRA. They can take out more money in years when their taxable income is lower, spreading out the withdrawal over the entire period to pay taxes on the inherited IRA over time. Alternatively, they can wait until the end of the 10-year period to take out the entire amount, which may result in a higher tax burden.

It's essential to understand the rules and navigate them carefully to minimize taxes and avoid penalties. Beneficiaries should consider their withdrawal schedule and tax implications when inheriting an IRA.

Tom Gardner: I don’t know if you’re a stock investor, but if you are not spending time investing in other stocks, let me put you in that position and ask you, what few things would you look for if you were out there looking to make an investment? Let’s say outside of the category of retail. If you’re just looking at businesses in technology and health care and finance, what qualities or what factors would you look for to put the Sinegal Fund Inc. capital into that business?
Jim Sinegal: Well the only stocks that I own are Costco and Berkshire Hathaway, so maybe that’ll tell you something.
Sinegal: I don’t invest in the stock market. I have real estate holdings, but I don’t invest in the stock market.
Gardner: But when you look at...
Sinegal: But if I were to look at it, I mean I made the obvious choice of Berkshire Hathaway because of performance and because of the caliber and the quality of the management, and the integrity that the management represents, so I think you would look for exactly those types of things. You want to know that you’re getting involved with a company that is leveling with you and telling you the full story and that their performance is just not some fly-by-night type of aberration, but that they really are a solid organization.
Gardner: So I’m going to continue to simulate hypotheticals, which can always make us uncomfortable, and if you’d like to choose to pass on any of these questions, feel free to.  Now imagine that you’re investing in a small kind of up-and-coming retailer.  What might you look for to say, ""Those guys, they’re doing it right. They may only be in one region right now of the country, and they may be a small cap with only $75 million on their balance sheet, but I like what I see because I see this about them as a retailer.""
Sinegal: I would look for the types of qualities that you see in a Trader Joe’s.  That you’ve got a niche, that you’ve got quality products, you’ve got a quality organization, everything about that seems to suggest quality, including the people that they hire in their stores, and so it’s pretty easy to get turned on by a business like that.
Sinegal: So I think I would look for those same types of qualities.

Between 1990 and 2001, the number of Trader Joe's stores quintupled and the company multiplied its profits by ten.5 In 2019, Trader Joe's was ranked number 23 in best places to work in the United States by Glassdoor and in 2020, the company ranked number 14.6 However, there are no short-term plans for Trader Joe's to go public. In fact, part of the reason the company has been able to achieve so much success is that it has remained a privately-owned company.
When a company decides to go public, it has to answer to its shareholders who become partial owners of the company when they purchase shares. Shareholders expect that a company will experience growth year-over-year. If this doesn't happen, shareholders may become dissatisfied. When they go public, many companies are pressured into making changes that expedite their growth but might be executed at the expense of their core values.
Because Trader Joe's doesn't have to answer to shareholders, it can stay true to its brand values and give its consumers, employees, and other internal stakeholders the type of experience they want.
For example, Trader Joe's has made a commitment to operating smaller stores. Although this gives the company less square footage to sell products, it creates a more intimate environment in their stores. Trader Joe's also maintains a smaller selection of products. If a product doesn't appear to be selling well in its stores, then the company can easily get rid of it and replace it with something else. As a result, customers can trust the quality of all of their products.
Trader Joe's also doesn't charge its suppliers a slotting fee. This fee is typical of grocers and means that their suppliers have to pay a fee in return for shelf space. This results in suppliers trying to outbid each other and ensures that the supplier who is willing to pay the highest bid price gets the shelf space. They may not be the most deserving supplier or have the best product to offer. In the case of slotting fees, higher prices are also passed on to customers, so Trader Joe's has opted not to charge their suppliers for slotting fees.
Food retailers and grocery chains are facing a changing landscape, with a growing number of discount grocers in the industry. The acquisition of Whole Foods Market (WFM) by Amazon in August 2017 also created more pressure in the industry. There is speculation that Whole Foods will make significant gains in terms of market share and could threaten Trader Joe's growth in the future.

Sinegal: I believe you would look for similar qualities to those of Berkshire Hathaway, such as exceptional performance, high-caliber management, and integrity. It's essential to have confidence in a company's ability to be transparent and deliver sustained performance, rather than just a short-term aberration.

A home equity loan and a personal loan both offer one-time, lump-sum payments that are required to be paid back in installments over an agreed-upon period of time. However, the main difference is that home equity loans are a specific form of a secured loan in which the borrower’s home is used as collateral. Personal loans, on the other hand, can be secured or unsecured by collateral and are a much broader and varied category.
As personal loans tend to have a less intensive approval process than a home equity loan, they can generally be quicker and more straightforward to obtain. While home equity loans usually will take longer to be approved, they tend to offer a lower interest rate than a personal loan and potentially a higher loan amount as well. Before pursuing either option, however, it’s important to consider the amount you need and the intended purpose of your loan.
Many personal loans are unsecured, but there are secured personal loans available that can be backed by collateral such as a certificate of deposit (CD), stocks, a vehicle, or savings.
Personal loans can be used for a variety of purposes, including consolidating credit card debt, paying off higher-interest debt, large expenses (such as a major home appliance or a vacation), or even establishing or improving your credit score.
Home equity loans also can be used for a range of purposes, such as debt consolidation, large one-time expenses, or educational or medical expenses. Keep in mind that a home equity loan is a lump-sum payment, so a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be a better fit for situations (such as a lengthy home renovation project or starting a business venture) where a large amount of ongoing funding is required or money will be needed continually over a period of time.
When you apply for a home equity loan, a lender will calculate your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio or combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio to consider how much money they will allow you to borrow. This calculation essentially answers this question: If the house is sold, would it cover the amount owed by your original mortgage and this additional loan, and by how much? It is also a large factor in determining the interest rate of your loan. Usually, the lower your LTV, the lower your interest rate.
Home equity loan interest rates are usually fixed, and they tend to be lower than both personal loans and credit cards because the home is used as collateral. However, the risk here is that if the loan is not paid off, the lender can repossess and sell the home to cover the remaining debt. It also means that if the value of your home decreases, you may end up underwater—the amount that you owe may exceed the value of the home.
Try using a loan calculator to get an idea of how much you’ll end up paying.
Personal loans can have lower interest rates than a credit card, but not necessarily. It will depend largely on the length and type of the loan (e.g., secured vs. unsecured) as well as the borrower’s credit history.
The biggest difference between a personal loan and a home equity loan is the structure. A home equity loan is a specific type of secured loan that uses the borrower’s house as collateral. While both offer lump-sum payments, the amounts for each can vary and the approval process is different (usually significantly shorter in the case of personal loans).
Investopedia commissioned a national survey of 962 U.S. adults between Aug. 14, 2023, to Sept. 15, 2023, who had taken out a personal loan to learn how they used their loan proceeds and how they might use future personal loans. Debt consolidation was the most common reason people borrowed money, followed by home improvement and other large expenditures.
In considering whether to pursue a personal loan vs. a home equity loan, it’s important to determine whether either option is best for your financial situation (or whether another type of credit, such as a line of credit or a refinancing option, might be more suitable). Use a loan calculator to get an idea of how much you will potentially be spending. Considering the purpose of the loan and the amount that you’ll need, shop around for the best options among various lenders, and ensure that you understand the entire agreement and any associated fees before signing anything.

This influences which products we write about and where and how the product appears on a page. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money.
Home equity loans and personal loans are both fixed-rate, lump-sum financing options.
Personal loans are unsecured and your rate is tied to your credit and income.
Home equity loans usually have lower rates, but your home is collateral for the loan.
Personal loans may be a better choice for debt consolidation, while home equity loans include tax incentives if you're doing a home improvement project.
Personal loans and home equity loans are both fixed-rate financing options that you get in a lump sum and repay in equal monthly installments over a predetermined repayment period.
That’s about the extent of their similarities. Knowing the differences between personal loans and home equity loans will help you choose the right one for your plans.
The biggest difference between personal and home equity loans is that personal loans are unsecured, meaning there’s no collateral, while home equity loans are secured by your home.
The two financing options also have different borrowing amounts, rates and qualification requirements.
Here are some differences between personal loans and home equity loans.
Up to 80% of your home's value, minus your outstanding mortgage.
Average range is 4% to 8%.
Minimum 560; higher scores are more likely to qualify.
Personal loans can work for homeowners who don’t have enough equity or don’t want to use their equity, as long as they have enough cash flow to make the monthly payments, says Ryan Greiser, owner and certified financial planner at Opulus, a financial advisory firm based outside of Philadelphia.
They’re also an option for urgent expenses because approval and funding take a few days rather than a few weeks.
Strong credit and income are key to qualifying and getting a low rate, so a personal loan will be more expensive if you have bad credit.
No equity or collateral: New homeowners and those with little equity can get a personal loan because lenders don’t consider equity on an application. You also don’t have to provide collateral to get an unsecured loan, and the lender can’t take your property if you fail to repay.
Fast funding: Most lenders can send funds to approved borrowers within a week of approval — some lenders can even fund a personal loan the same or next day.
Pre-qualification: Many lenders let borrowers pre-qualify to preview their loan amount, rate and repayment term with a soft credit pull.
Rates may be high: Personal loan annual percentage rates are from 6% to 36%, and those who qualify with fair or poor credit (scores below 690) will likely get a rate on the high end of that range.
Monthly payments may be high: High rates and short repayment terms can make monthly payments higher on personal loans than on home equity loans.
Home equity loans have low rates and long repayment terms that keep monthly payments low. Your home’s value is considered on a home equity loan application, meaning your credit score doesn’t weigh as heavily as it does with a personal loan.
The big question is whether you’re comfortable using your home as collateral. Because a home equity loan is a second mortgage, failure to repay gives the lender the right to take your house. If that thought bothers you, this may not be the financing option for you.
Low rates: The average home equity loan rate is 4% to 8%. The collateral on a home equity loan keeps rates low.
Fair-credit borrowers may qualify: Stellar credit isn’t required to get a home equity loan, and borrowers with fair credit scores may get a lower home equity loan rate than on a personal loan.
Interest may be tax-deductible: If you use the funds from a home equity loan for a home improvement project, the interest is tax deductible. This isn’t the case if you use the funds for other expenses.
Approval could take weeks: Deka Dike, a mortgage loan officer with U.S. Bank, says a home equity loan takes three to six weeks from application to funding.
Your home is at risk: If you can’t repay the loan, your house will be in jeopardy.
Not ideal if you plan to sell soon: If you sell your home before the loan is repaid, the balance of the home equity loan will be due.
The reason you’re borrowing is another factor to consider when choosing between personal and home equity loans. In most cases, comparing different financing options gives you a chance to find the lowest rate.
Here’s how personal and home equity loans work for different expenses.
Large home improvement projects: Low monthly payments on home equity loans make them a common financing option for kitchen remodels and swimming pool additions. It doesn’t hurt to check your personal loan rate to see which option is more affordable, but you can’t deduct interest on a personal loan like you can with an equity financing option.
Emergencies and small repairs: A personal loan will come through faster in an emergency than a home equity loan. With underwriting and appraisal included, you could wait a month or longer to get a home equity loan. But don’t discount affordability. If the roof is leaking but not ready to blow, take the time to compare home equity loans, personal loans and other financing options (more on those below).
Debt consolidation: Personal loans are commonly used for debt consolidation because they can have lower rates than credit cards and they don’t require collateral. If you don’t qualify for a low-rate personal loan, consider other debt-payoff options before tapping equity.
Here are other financing options to consider.
Home equity lines of credit: Consider a HELOC if you have enough equity but are uncertain how much money you need to borrow. With this type of financing, you borrow a certain amount but repay only what you use.
Credit cards: A credit card can help you transfer balances to consolidate debts or cover a small DIY home improvement project, but be mindful of your credit limit and utilization. Unlike personal and home equity loans, you can make interest-free purchases on a credit card — if you pay the balance before interest has a chance to accrue.
Cash-out refinance: Cash-out refinance makes sense when current mortgage rates are lower than what you’re paying. You refinance your mortgage for a higher amount than you owe, and then “cash out” the rest. Cash-out refinance often comes with closing costs and requires an appraisal, so your timeline and budget should be pretty concrete before you choose this option.
Mix and match: You can split an expense up between multiple types of financing, Greiser says. For example, you could pay for the bulk of a home improvement project with a personal loan, but use your credit card or savings to cover any unexpected costs. Just keep an eye on how much debt you take on overall.

Lea Uardu, J.D.: Home Equity Loans vs. Personal Loans: A Comprehensive Comparison

When it comes to borrowing money, many of us are faced with a daunting decision: should I opt for a home equity loan or a personal loan? Both options offer a lump-sum payment, but that's where the similarities end. In this article, we'll delve into the key differences between these two types of loans, helping you make an informed decision that suits your financial situation.

The Lowdown on Home Equity Loans

Home equity loans are a specific type of secured loan, where your home is used as collateral. This means that if you're unable to repay the loan, your lender can repossess and sell your home to cover the remaining debt. However, home equity loans often offer lower interest rates than personal loans and credit cards, making them an attractive option for those with a stable income and a significant amount of equity in their home.

On the other hand, home equity loans usually have a more intensive approval process, which can take longer to complete. Additionally, if the value of your home decreases, you may end up underwater – where the amount you owe exceeds the value of your home.

The Lowdown on Personal Loans

Personal loans, on the other hand, can be secured or unsecured by collateral and offer a much broader and varied category of options. While they may have a less intensive approval process than home equity loans, personal loans tend to have higher interest rates. However, they can be used for a variety of purposes, including consolidating credit card debt, paying off higher-interest debt, large expenses, or even establishing or improving your credit score.

Secured personal loans are backed by collateral, such as a certificate of deposit (CD), stocks, a vehicle, or savings, which can provide a lower interest rate and better loan terms. Unsecured personal loans, on the other hand, don't require collateral, but may have higher interest rates and stricter credit requirements.

When to Choose a Home Equity Loan

Home equity loans are ideal for those who need a large sum of money for a specific purpose, such as debt consolidation, large one-time expenses, or educational or medical expenses. Since home equity loans are lump-sum payments, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be a better fit for situations where ongoing funding is required over a period of time.

When to Choose a Personal Loan

Personal loans are a great option for those who need a smaller amount of money for a specific purpose, such as consolidating credit card debt, paying off higher-interest debt, or covering large expenses. They're also ideal for those who don't have enough equity in their home to secure a home equity loan or prefer not to put their home at risk.

The Importance of Loan Calculators

Before applying for either type of loan, it's essential to use a loan calculator to get an idea of how much you'll end up paying. This will help you determine whether a home equity loan or personal loan is best for your financial situation.

The Bottom Line

In conclusion, while both home equity loans and personal loans offer lump-sum payments, they have distinct differences in terms of interest rates, approval processes, and collateral requirements. By understanding these differences and considering your financial situation, you can make an informed decision that suits your needs.

**Home Equity Loans vs. Personal Loans: What's the Difference?**

When you need a lump sum of cash, you may be considering a home equity loan or a personal loan. Both options offer one-time payments, but they operate differently and have distinct advantages. Here's what you need to know to make an informed decision.

**Key differences**

A home equity loan is a secured loan, which means your home is used as collateral. This type of loan typically offers a lower interest rate and a higher loan amount compared to a personal loan. However, the approval process can take longer. On the other hand, personal loans can be secured or unsecured, and they usually have a faster approval process. But, they may come with higher interest rates and lower loan amounts.

**Using a personal loan**

Personal loans can be used for various purposes, such as consolidating debt, paying off high-interest debt, or covering large expenses like a vacation or a home appliance. You can also use a personal loan to improve your credit score. Some personal loans are secured, meaning they're backed by collateral like a certificate of deposit, stocks, a vehicle, or savings.

**Home equity loan options**

Home equity loans can also be used for different purposes, including debt consolidation, large expenses, or educational and medical expenses. Keep in mind that a home equity loan is a lump sum payment, so a home equity line of credit (HELOC) might be a better fit for situations that require ongoing funding, such as a lengthy home renovation project or starting a business venture.

**Understanding loan-to-value ratios**

When you apply for a home equity loan, the lender will calculate your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio or combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio to determine how much you can borrow. This ratio considers how much your home is worth compared to the outstanding mortgage balance and the additional loan amount. A lower LTV ratio usually means a lower interest rate.

**Home equity loan interest rates**

Home equity loan interest rates are typically fixed and lower than those of personal loans and credit cards. However, the risk is that if you default on the loan, the lender can repossess and sell your home to cover the remaining debt.

**Personal loan interest rates**

Personal loan interest rates vary depending on the type of loan and your credit history. While they may be lower than credit card rates, they can still be higher than home equity loan rates.

**Before applying**

Before choosing between a home equity loan and a personal loan, consider the purpose of the loan and the amount you need. Use a loan calculator to estimate your total costs. Then, shop around for the best options among various lenders, and make sure you understand the terms and fees associated with each loan.

If you are among the millions of Americans who contribute to a 401(k) plan, you receive a quarterly account statement composed of dull, incomprehensible financial prose. However, you want to maximize your contributions—so you'll need to understand the types of investments offered in these investments.
Learn more about 401(k)s, which are best suited for you, and how to manage the account going forward to maximize your returns.
Mutual funds are the most common investment option offered in 401(k) plans, though some are starting to offer exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Both mutual funds and ETFs contain a basket of securities such as equities.
The first consideration is highly personal, your so-called risk tolerance. Only you are qualified to say whether you love the idea of taking a flier or whether you prefer to play it safe.
The next consideration is your age, specifically how many years you are from retirement. The basic rule of thumb is that a younger person can invest a greater percentage in riskier stock funds. At best, the funds could pay off big. At worst, there is time to recoup losses since retirement is not imminent.
The same person should gradually reduce holdings in risky funds, moving to safe havens as retirement approaches. In the ideal scenario, the older investor has stashed those big early gains in a safe place while still adding money for the future.
Traditional guidance is that the percentage of your money invested in stocks should equal 100 minus your age. More recently, that figure has been revised to 110 or even 120 because the average life expectancy has increased. Using a basis of 120, a 30-year-old would invest 90% of their portfolio in equities, while a 70-year-old would invest 50%.
As a general rule of thumb, many financial advisors recommend having enough saved in retirement funds plus other sources of income, such as social security or a pension, to replace 80% of your income before retirement. If you have determined how much you will receive from other sources of income, you can use a conservative estimate of roughly 5–6% in annual returns from your 401(k) to figure out what sort of balance you will need to generate the additional income to achieve 80%.
Another quick and simple way to estimate the amount you will need to have saved is to take your pre-retirement income and multiply it by 12. So, for example, if you were making $50,000 a year and were considering retirement, you should have about $600,000 saved in your 401(k).
A more comprehensive approach would be to use a ""retirement calculator."" Many financial institutions that manage 401(k) plans offer online, interactive retirement calculator tools that will allow you to use different assumptions and automatically calculate the required savings amount needed to achieve your goals. They typically also have knowledgeable representatives that will walk you through the process. You should take advantage of these resources if they are available, assuming you don't already have a financial advisor.
You probably already know that spreading your 401(k) account balance across various investment types makes good sense. Diversification helps you capture returns from a mix of investments—stocks, bonds, commodities, and others—while protecting your balance against the risk of a downturn in any one asset class.
Your decisions start with picking an asset-allocation approach you can live with during up and down markets. After that, it's a matter of fighting the temptation to time the market, trade too often or think you can outsmart the markets. Review your asset allocations periodically, perhaps annually, but try not to micromanage.
Some experts advise saying no to company stock, which concentrates your 401(k) portfolio too narrowly and increases the risk that a bearish run on the shares could wipe out a big chunk of your savings.
Vesting restrictions may also prevent you from holding on to the shares if you leave or change jobs, making you unable to control the timing of your investments. If you're bullish on your company and feel you want to invest in its stock, the general rule of thumb is to have no more than 10% of your portfolio made up of company stock.
Target-date funds can be a good set-it-and-forget-it option for retirement accounts. These funds offer diversified portfolios that automatically become more conservative over time as retirement approaches.
It costs money to run a 401(k) plan. The fees generally come out of your investment returns. Consider the following example posted by the Department of Labor.
It's important to be aware that you can't avoid all the fees and costs associated with your 401(k) plan. They are determined by the deal your employer made with the financial services company that manages the plan.
Among your choices, avoid funds that charge the biggest management fees and sales charges. Actively managed funds are those that hire analysts to conduct securities research. This research is expensive and drives up management fees.
If you are many years from retirement and struggling with the here and now, you may think a 401(k) plan isn't a priority. However, the combination of an employer match (if the company offers it) and a tax benefit should make it irresistible—the employer's match is tax-deferred money invested for you.
When starting out, the achievable goal might be a minimum contribution to your 401(k) plan. That minimum should be the amount that qualifies you for the entire match from your employer. You also need to contribute the maximum yearly contribution to get the full tax savings.
Once your portfolio is in place, monitor its performance. Keep in mind that various stock market sectors do not always move in lockstep. For example, if your portfolio contains both large-cap and small-cap stocks, the small-cap portion of the portfolio will likely grow more quickly than the large-cap portion. If this occurs, it may be time to rebalance your portfolio by selling some of your small-cap holdings and reinvesting the proceeds in large-cap stocks.
While it may seem counterintuitive to sell the best-performing asset in your portfolio and replace it with an asset that has not performed as well, keep in mind that your goal is to maintain your chosen asset allocation. When one portion of your portfolio grows more rapidly than another, your asset allocation is skewed toward the best-performing asset. If nothing about your financial goals has changed, rebalancing to maintain your desired asset allocation is a sound investment strategy.
Most people will change jobs more than half-a-dozen times throughout a lifetime. Some of them may cash out of their 401(k) plans every time they move, which can be costly. If you cash out every time, you will have nothing left when you need it—especially given that you'll pay taxes on the funds, plus a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're under 59½.10 Even if your balance is too low to keep in the plan, you can roll that money over to an IRA and let it keep growing.
As long as you can afford to do so, it's often advised that you contribute enough to your 401(k) to at least maximize your employer's contribution.
If you work for a company that offers a 401(k) plan, contact the human resources or payroll specialist responsible for employee benefits. You'll likely be asked to create a brokerage account through the brokerage firm your employee has selected to manage your funds. During the setup process, you'll get to choose how much you want to invest and which types of investments you want your 401(k) funds invested in.
There are two main benefits to a 401(k). First, companies usually match at least a portion of the money you put into your 401(k). Second, these accounts come with tax benefits. You don't have to pay taxes on the money you contribute or on the gains you earn over time if your contributions are pre-tax and made to a traditional 401(k), but you'll have to pay regular income tax on the withdrawals when it comes time to take the money out in retirement. You don't get to deduct your contributions on your federal income tax return if your contributions are post-tax and made to a Roth 401(k), but your gains over time aren't taxed, nor are your withdrawals in retirement.
Yes. Because your 401(k) will be invested in various assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, etc.), your portfolio will be exposed to market risk. If the stock market crashes, the stock component of your portfolio will also go down in value.
Building a better runway to retirement or financial independence starts with saving. The ""pay yourself first"" method works best, which is why your employer's 401(k) plan is a good place to place cash.
Once you get past the endless prose of the financial company's literature, you may find yourself genuinely interested in the wide variety of investing that a 401(k) plan opens to you. In any case, you'll enjoy watching your nest egg grow from quarter to quarter.

Nothing is more central to your retirement plan than your 401(k). It represents the largest chunk of most retirement nest eggs.
Finding the money to save in the account is just step one. Step two is investing it, and that’s one place where people often get tripped up. Here's how to invest your 401(k).
Some people think investing is too risky, but the risk is actually in holding cash. That’s right: You’ll lose money if you don’t invest your retirement savings.
Clearly you’re better off putting your cash to work. But how? The answer is a careful asset allocation, the process of deciding where your money will be invested. Asset allocation spreads out risk. Stocks — often called equities — are the riskiest way to invest; bonds and other fixed-income investments are the least risky. Just as you wouldn’t park your life savings in cash, you wouldn’t bet it all on a spectacular return from a startup IPO.
Instead, you want a road map that allows for the appropriate amount of risk and keeps you pointed in the right long-term direction.
Investors who have decades to save should take more risk early on and gradually dial it down as retirement approaches. As a rule of thumb, you can subtract your age from 110 or 100 to find the percentage of your portfolio that should be invested in equities; the rest should be in bonds. Using 110 will lead to a more aggressive portfolio; 100 will skew more conservative.
401(k)s tend to have a small investment selection that’s curated by your plan provider and your employer. You’re not selecting individual stocks and bonds (whew!), but mutual funds — ideally ETFs or index funds — that pool your money along with that of other investors to buy small pieces of many related securities.
Stock funds are divided into categories. Your 401(k) will probably offer at least one fund in each of the following categories: U.S. large cap — which refers to the value of the companies within — U.S. small cap, international, emerging markets and, in some plans, alternatives such as natural resources or real estate. Diversify your portfolio by spreading the portion you’ve allocated to equities among these funds.
That might mean putting 50% of your equity allocation into a U.S. large cap fund, 30% into an international fund, 10% into a U.S. small cap fund and spreading the remainder among categories such as emerging markets and natural resources.
The bond selection in 401(k)s tends to be even more narrow, but generally you’ll be offered a total bond market fund. If you have access to an international bond fund, you might put a bit of your savings in there to diversify globally.
You can search for risk ratings for specific funds on your plan provider’s website or on Morningstar.com.
» MORE: Learn about how to invest in stocks.
Expense ratios are the fees carried by investments, and they range widely. They’re charged as a percentage of the amount invested.
You might find your 401(k) offers only one choice in some of the above categories, but when you have a selection, you should generally pick the lowest-cost option — often an index fund. Index funds invest by tracking an index, such as the S&P 500, so they’re less expensive than a mutual fund, which is actively managed by a professional. You’ll pay for that person to pull the levers, and it often doesn’t translate into better returns.
Even small differences in fees can have a huge effect over time. Say you’ve invested $100,000 at a 7% annual return: A fund with a 0.80% expense ratio could eat up $70,000 more of your returns over 30 years than a fund with a 0.40% expense ratio.
Expense ratios are disclosed on each fund’s page on your 401(k) plan provider website, as well as in the fund’s prospectus.

If you’ve fallen asleep by now, or you’re paralyzed with fear, you’d probably benefit from a little more help. You have a few options, all of which may cost slightly more than a DIY approach — but then again, it’s hard to put a price on peace of mind.
One is a target date fund, available in virtually all 401(k)s. These funds have a year in their names, designed to correspond to the year you plan to retire. If you’re 30, you might pick a 2050 fund. You put all of your 401(k) money in this fund, which diversifies for you and automatically takes less risk as you approach that year.
Another option, which may be superior to a target-date fund, is a robo-advisor or an online planning service. Some robo-advisors will weigh in on or answer questions about your 401(k). Online planning services, including many of the ones on our list of the best financial advisors, offer low-cost access to human advisors and provide comprehensive guidance on your finances, including how to invest your 401(k).

**Make the Most of Your 401(k) Plan**

Are you among the millions of Americans who contribute to a 401(k) plan? If so, you receive a quarterly account statement that may be filled with confusing financial jargon. However, understanding your investment options is crucial to maximizing your contributions and securing your financial future.

**Understanding Your Investment Options**

Mutual funds are the most common investment option offered in 401(k) plans, although some plans are starting to offer exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Both types of funds contain a basket of securities, such as stocks and bonds.

**Determining Your Risk Tolerance**

Before investing, consider your personal risk tolerance. Are you willing to take on more risk in hopes of higher returns, or do you prefer to play it safe? Your age also plays a role in determining your investment strategy. A general rule of thumb is that the percentage of your portfolio invested in stocks should equal 100 minus your age. For example, a 30-year-old would invest 70% of their portfolio in stocks, while a 70-year-old would invest 30%.

**Using a Retirement Calculator**

Many financial institutions offer online retirement calculators that can help you determine how much you need to save for retirement. These calculators take into account your income, expenses, and investment returns to provide a personalized savings goal. Be sure to take advantage of these resources to ensure you're on track to meet your retirement goals.

**Diversifying Your Portfolio**

Diversification is key to capturing returns from a mix of investments while minimizing risk. Consider spreading your 401(k) account balance across various investment types, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. Avoid putting too much of your portfolio into company stock, as this can increase your risk exposure.

**Avoiding Fees and Costs**

Fees and costs can eat into your investment returns, so it's essential to be aware of them. Avoid funds with high management fees and sales charges. Consider opting for low-cost index funds or ETFs instead.

**Taking Advantage of Employer Matching**

If your employer offers a 401(k) matching program, be sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money that can help your retirement savings grow faster.

**Rebalancing Your Portfolio**

As your portfolio grows, it's essential to rebalance your investments periodically to ensure you're staying on track with your investment strategy. This may involve selling some of your investments and reinvesting the proceeds in other assets.

**Rolling Over Your 401(k) Plan**

If you change jobs or leave your employer, consider rolling over your 401(k) plan to an IRA. This can help you avoid early withdrawal penalties and keep your retirement savings growing.

**Getting Started**

If you're new to investing in a 401(k) plan, start by contributing enough to take advantage of your employer's matching program. Then, consider increasing your contributions over time to maximize your retirement savings.

**Disclaimer**

Investing in a 401(k) plan involves risk, including the potential loss of principal. There are no guarantees that your investments will grow or that you'll achieve your retirement goals. It's essential to educate yourself on investing and consider seeking the advice of a financial professional before making investment decisions.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of NerdWallet:

**Understanding Your 401(k) Plan: A Beginner's Guide**

Many Americans contribute to a 401(k) plan, but understanding how to maximize your returns can be daunting. In this article, we'll break down the basics of a 401(k) plan, including investment options, contribution strategies, and how to choose the right asset allocation for your goals.

**What is a 401(k) Plan?**

A 401(k) plan is a retirement savings plan sponsored by your employer. Contributions are made on a pre-tax basis, reducing your taxable income, and the funds grow tax-deferred. You can choose from a variety of investment options, such as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and target-date funds.

**Investment Options**

Mutual funds and ETFs are the most common investment options in 401(k) plans. Both contain a basket of securities, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. When selecting investments, consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. If you're younger, you may want to invest more in stocks, which historically offer higher returns over the long term. As you approach retirement, you may want to shift to more conservative investments, such as bonds.

**Contribution Strategies**

To maximize your returns, contribute enough to take full advantage of your employer's match, if offered. Consider contributing at least enough to receive the full match, as it's essentially free money. You may also want to contribute as much as possible, especially if you're older and closer to retirement.

**Asset Allocation**

Diversification is key to a successful investment strategy. Spread your 401(k) account balance across various investment types, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. This reduces your risk and increases potential returns. Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your target allocation.

**Target-Date Funds**

Target-date funds are a popular choice for 401(k) plans. These funds offer a diversified portfolio that automatically becomes more conservative as retirement approaches. They're a good option if you're not comfortable selecting individual investments.

**Fees and Expenses**

Be aware of the fees and expenses associated with your 401(k) plan. These costs can eat into your returns, so it's essential to understand what you're paying. Look for low-cost index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower fees than actively managed funds.

**Withdrawal Strategy**

When you retire, you'll need to withdraw from your 401(k) plan to support your living expenses. Consider withdrawing 4% to 5% of your portfolio each year, adjusted for inflation, to ensure sustainable income.

**Conclusion**

Understanding your 401(k) plan is crucial to maximizing your returns and achieving your retirement goals. By contributing regularly, selecting the right investments, and diversifying your portfolio, you'll be well on your way to a secure financial future.

0.533333333333333,"The best credit card for emergencies will often depend on your financial situation. If you already have an emergency fund, any credit card with a reasonable credit limit can do the job in a pinch.
Unfortunately, we don't all have an emergency fund on hand. And some emergencies can stretch even a healthy savings balance to its limits.
In these cases, your requirements for an emergency credit card may be different from your regular cards. We've put together a list of the cards we'd find most useful in an emergency, as well as a few things to consider when selecting your own emergency credit card.
With a generous intro APR offer for both balance transfers and purchases, this is one of the best low interest credit cards we've come across.
The type of credit card that works best as your emergency card is the one that suits your financial needs. Intro APR cards are great for emergency expenses that may take some time to repay. Rewards credit cards, on the other hand, are best for folks who have savings they can tap into, but who want the convenience of a credit card in an emergency.
A credit card with an intro 0% APR offer can be extremely valuable as an emergency card. These cards charge no interest on purchases for the length of the introductory period. With some of the top options, this can mean 18 months or more of zero interest.
It's important to consider the details of the offer before using your card. This includes the length of the introductory period as well as the standard APR you'll be charged once the intro offer is over. All this information can be found in your credit card's Schumer box, located in the terms and conditions documentation.
You'll still need to make at least the minimum required payment every month even if you have an 0% intro APR offer. No interest does not mean no payments.
In some cases, having an emergency fund doesn't always negate the need -- or utility -- of an emergency credit card. Credit cards are far more convenient in an emergency than trying to withdraw money from a savings account. If you already have an emergency fund and simply want a credit card on hand for peace of mind, a rewards credit card can be a good option.
Since emergencies are rarely inexpensive, any way you can get a little bit back can be worthwhile. For example, some of the best cash back rewards cards offer 2% cash back on purchases. This could take a little of the sting out of a pricey car repair or unexpected medical bill.
You can also find rewards cards with extra perks that can come in handy in an emergency. A credit card concierge may help you find important services, like car repair shops, while away from home. You could also take advantage of your existing points or miles to save money on last-minute travel or car rentals.
RELATED: How Do Credit Card Points Work?
You can find a few credit cards specifically designed to help people pay for medical expenses. These cards often have low interest rates and no annual fee. Some may even have special financing offers that let you make payments over time. Just watch out for deferred interest (see the section on deferred interest below).
A few medical credit cards will require you to have good credit. However, others may have more flexible credit requirements. This can make them useful alternatives for people with fair or even bad credit.
Keep in mind medical credit cards can typically only be used for medical expenses. This makes them of limited use as general emergency credit cards. You may also want to explore low interest credit cards as an all-purpose alternative.
Credit cards are convenient in emergencies, but they're not without their downsides. Here are a few things to consider before using your credit card to finance emergency expenses.
One big concern when covering large emergency bills is your card's credit limit. For one thing, you need to consider if your card's credit limit is large enough for the expenses at hand. While some high limit credit cards can have limits of $10,000 or more, these are the exception, not the rule.
LEARN MORE: What Happens if You Go Over Your Credit Limit?
Not only can going over your credit limit cause problems, but even getting near your limit can have negative consequences. That's because it will increase your credit utilization rate. This is the ratio of your credit card balance and available credit. A high utilization rate can cause your credit score to decrease. In some cases, it may even cause your issuer to reduce your credit limit.
LEARN MORE: What Is a Credit Utilization Ratio?
If you need a higher credit card limit, you may have options. For instance, you can request a higher credit limit from your issuer. This may require a credit check and meeting basic credit history and income requirements.
Although we talked about the benefits of intro APR offers above, there's another kind of zero-interest offer you may encounter: deferred interest offers. While they can seem similar on the surface, financing offers that use deferred interest can be expensive if you're not careful.
LEARN MORE: What Is Deferred Interest?
With a regular intro APR offer, you aren't charged any interest for the length of the introductory period. Once that ends, your remaining balance starts accruing interest at the standard rate.
LEARN MORE: How Does Credit Card Interest Work?
With deferred interest financing, you pay no interest on your purchase only if you pay the balance in full before the end of the promotional period.
In other words, if any of the financed balance remains at the end of the promotional period, you'll be charged interest on the entire balance. This applies if you still owe hundreds -- or just a few bucks.
Here's an example: You make a $1,000 purchase. In Example A, you use a credit card with a 12-month 0% APR introductory offer. In Example B, you use a credit card with a 12-month 0% interest financing deal with deferred interest.
In Example A, you pay no interest on your purchase for the first 12 months. If you pay off the full purchase, great! If you only pay off $900 after 12 months, the remaining $100 balance will start accruing interest at the standard APR.
In Example B, you pay no interest on your purchase for 12 months. If you pay the full $1,000, you never pay any interest on the purchase. If you only pay off $900 after 12 months, you will be charged interest at the standard rate on the entire $1,000 purchase.
There's no arguing that credit cards can be a convenient tool for emergencies. But they're not always the best tool.
Without an intro APR offer, credit card balances can accrue interest if not paid in full at the end of your billing cycle. And credit cards tend to charge high interest rates.
Before putting a large balance on your credit card, it may be worthwhile to use a credit card payoff calculator like the one below to see how long it will take you to pay off your balance -- and how expensive it will be when you're done.
If you can't pay off your credit card quickly, it may be better to consider alternative options. Here are some common alternatives to using credit cards for emergency expenses.
A personal loan is a loan you take out that can be used for just about anything. They are distributed as a lump sum and then paid off in monthly installments.
LEARN MORE: Does Maxing Out a Credit Card Hurt Your Score?
Depending on the nature of the emergency, you may be able to work out a payment plan. For example, many doctors and other medical providers will help you set up monthly payments for large bills. You may also have this option with other services, like mechanics, especially if you're already on good terms with the business. At the very least, it doesn't hurt to ask.
This option applies mostly to medical emergencies, but could potentially apply to other situations. Many hospitals will forgive some, or even all, of your debt if you qualify. This is most often an option for low-income families. You can contact the hospital's finance department to ask about financial assistance. You'll likely need to fill out some paperwork on your financial situation, then wait for a response. If nothing else, you may get your bill reduced.
In other cases, it may be better to consider alternative payment methods. The most common alternative is to use a personal loan.
Yes, most, if not all, medical expenses can be put on a credit card. This includes expenses you need to pay at time of service as well as those you are billed for later.

A good rule of thumb recommended by personal finance experts is to have an emergency fund — enough money socked away in savings to cover three to six months' worth of living costs. An emergency fund can help you ride out a disruption to your income without going deep into debt by putting living expenses on credit cards or taking out loans.
It's important to acknowledge that, for some, it can be hard to save that much. If every penny of income goes toward basic living expenses, it can be difficult to build an emergency fund. If disaster strikes — such as a layoff, a big medical bill or an urgent car or home repair — they may have to lean on their credit cards to get through. You do what you have to do to survive.
But other people do have the ability to save money for an emergency but choose not to, reasoning that they can fall back on their credit cards. In doing so, they may put their financial future at risk. Here are some reasons why credit cards shouldn't be treated as an emergency fund if you can afford to save.
Saving money for an emergency is an exercise in forethought: You have extra income today, so you set it aside for a time when you might not have any income at all. By contrast, when you use credit cards as your emergency fund, the money you spend becomes credit card debt that you'll eventually have to repay. Your ""present self"" is borrowing money from your ""future self."" But, critically, you don't know whether that future self will have the extra income to handle the debt. If they don't, you may be sending them (meaning: yourself) a crushing debt load.
Alternative: Start an emergency fund, even if you can only contribute $5 per week. By starting small, you won’t miss the money you’re putting away. Make a realistic savings plan and set incremental goals toward stashing away six months’ worth of expenses. Even if that goal is distant, a small emergency fund of $500 can prevent you from falling into a debt cycle when you have an emergency like a car or home repair.
Using a credit card for emergency spending not only produces debt, but you'll pay for the privilege of having that debt. Most credit cards charge double-digit interest rates, making it even harder to pay down the balance.
Alternative: If you must rely on a credit card to supplement an emergency fund, it’s better to apply for a new credit card that has a 0% introductory APR on purchases. These cards typically require a good credit score (a FICO score of 690 or higher), but if you can qualify, it will save you money on interest for the duration of the offer.
In a world where using a credit card for a 50-cent pack of gum is common, it's easy to think cards are universally accepted. But plastic sometimes isn't welcome, and this could come at a very inconvenient (or scary) moment. For example, if you need an emergency repair on your home, the contractor might not take credit cards due to additional fees and risks that come with accepting them as a payment method.
Alternative: When an emergency fund isn’t enough, you might already have a credit card that can spot you the cash or offer an alternative way to pay. Some credit cards offer cheaper ways to access your credit line. Chase, for example, offers My Chase Loan to select cardholders, which allows you to borrow money from your credit line and get it deposited into your bank account. It’s similar to a personal loan from a bank.
If you max out a credit card (or two) to cope with a catastrophe, you can expect your credit scores to drop substantially. That's because you've significantly increased your credit utilization ratio, which is the amount you owe as a percentage of your credit limit. As a result, the 30% of your FICO score determined by amounts owed will take a big hit. This is fixable, but it could make getting credit difficult or very expensive in the future.
Alternative: When you’re out of credit options and money, the next best course of action is to seek advice from a credit counselor who may provide direction for your finances and potentially point you to resources for your situation.
If you're keeping an extra credit card on hand for emergencies but don't use it otherwise, you might be in for a nasty surprise at the worst time. Issuers commonly close credit card accounts that have been inactive for a certain length of time. Issuers may also trim credit limits or close accounts in an uncertain economy. Further, when an account is being closed due to user inactivity, the issuer doesn't have to give you any advance notice. This means you could be stuck without a credit line when you need it most.
Alternative: When you lose access to credit and you need money for an emergency, look beyond your credit cards. You may be able to free up some money by lowering the cost of your bills. Community loans or selling goods may offer fast cash, and a side job can provide extra income.
A credit card makes for a weak safety net for emergencies, but it can be worth using one if you want to supplement your plan B with a plan C to keep your bases covered. Useful credit cards for emergencies allow you to quickly access your credit line or borrow against it. Here are some credit cards that may be worth tapping for an emergency.
It’s worth keeping a card like the Upgrade Cash Rewards Visa® open and active for uncertain times. It can be used in two ways: by making charges to your card or by borrowing against your credit line. If you choose the latter option, you pay it back in equal monthly installments over a set period with a fixed interest rate and a 5% cash advance fee. With excellent credit, you may also qualify for a low ongoing interest rate: The ongoing APR is 14.99%-29.99%. But, it's also possible to qualify with fair credit (FICO scores of at least 630). The Upgrade Cash Rewards Visa® also earns 1.5% cash back on all purchases. It has a $0 annual fee.
When you’re in a bind, applying for a credit card isn’t ideal since you have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. The Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express can be used instantly after approval. After getting approved online, you get an instant card number that can be used wherever a nonphysical AmEx card is accepted. It has an introductory offer: 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers, and then the ongoing APR of 19.24%-29.99% Variable APR. It has a $0 annual fee and it earns rewards on everyday purchases. Terms apply.
Credit unions are likely to have lower ongoing interest rates on credit cards, but they do require membership eligibility to apply. If you can qualify with membership and good credit (a FICO score of 690 or higher), it’s worth having a low-interest credit card as a backup option for unforeseen circumstances. NASA Federal Credit Union has an easy path to join, allowing you to be a member of the National Space Society if you can’t meet other criteria. It offers the NASA Federal Platinum Advantage Rewards Credit Card, which has a low ongoing APR: 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers, and then the ongoing APR of 19.24%-29.99% Variable APR. It has a $0 annual fee and also earns rewards.
These credit cards could potentially come through for you during an emergency, assuming no obstacles arise. Still, nothing beats having money in a reliable, federally insured emergency fund.
The ideal emergency fund should cover six months' worth of expenses, but even $500 can go a long way to keeping debt at bay.
Open a high-interest savings account. You want an account that is separate from your checking account so that you won’t be tempted to touch your savings for everyday expenses.
Review your budget for savings opportunities. A look at your budget can help you set goals within reach. Calculate how much to save to cover six months’ worth of expenses and try to build toward that long-term goal.
Decide on a monthly savings goal. Determine how much to contribute to your account each month. If the goal seems overwhelming, start small with strategies like the 52-week money-saving challenge. An accountability partner who also has savings goals may offer a way to check in frequently and stay on track.
Determine whether you'll automate contributions or do it manually. A manual approach may keep you more engaged with your finances. An automated approach makes it easier to be consistent with your savings. If you're forgetful or lack the discipline to save, choose the latter.
Do periodic check-ins and increase your contributions when possible. Reflect on the progress you’ve made and update the countdown of months or years to arrive at your goal.
Stash those windfalls. Use any windfalls received in the form of monetary gifts, tax refunds or other funds to pad your emergency fund and get closer to your goal. And, increase your monthly savings goal when possible after getting a raise or finding spare change in your budget.
An emergency fund is only solid when it’s kept intact, so replenish any withdrawals you make to avoid depleting it over time. With consistent monthly contributions, you can maintain an emergency fund for trying times.

Emergency Credit Cards: When You Need a Financial Safety Net

The concept of an emergency fund is essential to personal finance, but we don't all have one in place. And when unexpected expenses arise, a credit card can be a valuable backup plan. However, not all credit cards are created equal when it comes to emergency funding. We've put together a list of top picks for emergency credit cards, as well as some key factors to consider when selecting your own.

Introductory APR offers can be a lifesaver in emergency situations. These cards charge no interest on purchases for a set period, which can be up to 18 months or more. When evaluating an intro APR offer, be sure to consider the length of the promotional period and the standard APR that will apply once it ends. This information can be found in the Schumer box, located in the terms and conditions documentation.

Remember, even with a 0% intro APR offer, you'll still need to make at least the minimum payment each month. No interest doesn't mean no payments.

In some cases, having an emergency fund doesn't negate the need for an emergency credit card. Credit cards can be more convenient than dipping into savings in an emergency, and rewards credit cards can offer a little extra peace of mind. For example, some cash back rewards cards offer 2% cash back on purchases, which can help offset the cost of an unexpected expense.

You can also find rewards cards with extra perks, such as concierge services to help you find important services, like car repair shops, while away from home. Or, you can use your existing points or miles to save money on last-minute travel or car rentals.

Some credit cards are specifically designed to help with medical expenses, often featuring low interest rates and no annual fee. These cards may also offer special financing deals that allow you to make payments over time. Just be sure to watch out for deferred interest (more on that below).

Keep in mind that medical credit cards typically can only be used for medical expenses, making them less versatile than a general-purpose emergency credit card. You may want to explore low-interest credit cards as an alternative.

While credit cards can be convenient in emergencies, they're not without their downsides. Here are a few things to consider before using your credit card to finance emergency expenses.

One big concern is your card's credit limit. Will it be enough to cover the expenses at hand? If not, you may need to request a higher credit limit from your issuer, which may require a credit check and meeting basic credit history and income requirements.

Another issue to consider is deferred interest financing. While it may seem similar to intro APR offers, deferred interest financing can be expensive if you're not careful. With deferred interest, you pay no interest on your purchase only if you pay the balance in full before the end of the promotional period. If you still owe a balance at the end of the period, you'll be charged interest on the entire original purchase.

To illustrate the difference, let's take an example. You make a $1,000 purchase using a credit card with a 12-month 0% APR introductory offer. In this case, you pay no interest on your purchase for the first 12 months. If you pay off the full purchase, great! If you only pay off $900 after 12 months, the remaining $100 balance will start accruing interest at the standard APR.

On the other hand, if you use a credit card with a 12-month 0% interest financing deal with deferred interest, you pay no interest on your purchase for 12 months. If you pay the full $1,000, you never pay any interest on the purchase. But if you only pay off $900 after 12 months, you will be charged interest at the standard rate on the entire $1,000 purchase.

In addition to credit cards, there are alternative options for emergency funding. A personal loan, for example, can be used for just about anything and is distributed as a lump sum, then paid off in monthly installments.

You may also be able to work out a payment plan with the service provider, such as a doctor or mechanic. At the very least, it doesn't hurt to ask.

In some cases, you may be able to get financial assistance or debt forgiveness, particularly with medical expenses. Many hospitals will forgive some or all of your debt if you qualify, often for low-income families. You can contact the hospital's finance department to ask about financial assistance and fill out the necessary paperwork.

Ultimately, credit cards can be a convenient tool for emergencies, but they're not always the best option. Before putting a large balance on your credit card, consider using a credit card payoff calculator to see how long it will take you to pay off your balance – and how expensive it will be in the long run.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of NerdWallet:

**The Best Credit Cards for Emergencies**

Finding the right credit card for emergencies can be a challenge, especially if you don't have an emergency fund set aside. But don't worry, we've got you covered. We've put together a list of the best credit cards for emergencies, as well as some things to consider when choosing a card.

**Why You Need an Emergency Credit Card**

If you don't have an emergency fund, an emergency credit card can be a lifesaver. And even if you do have a fund, a credit card can still come in handy in a pinch. The key is to find a card that fits your financial needs.

**Intro APR Cards: A Good Option**

Intro APR cards are a great choice for emergency expenses that may take some time to repay. These cards offer a 0% introductory APR period, which can be a big help if you need to carry a balance for a few months. Just be sure to check the length of the intro period and the standard APR that will apply once it ends.

**Rewards Cards: Another Option**

If you have some savings set aside, a rewards credit card can be a good choice for emergencies. You can earn cash back or travel rewards on your purchases, which can help offset the cost of an unexpected expense. Just be sure to pay your balance in full each month to avoid interest charges.

**Medical Credit Cards: A Specialized Option**

If you're facing a medical emergency, a medical credit card can be a good choice. These cards offer low interest rates and flexible payment terms, which can help make medical expenses more manageable. Just be sure to read the fine print and understand the terms and conditions of the card.

**Things to Consider**

Before using a credit card for an emergency, there are a few things to consider. First, make sure you have enough credit available to cover the expense. You don't want to go over your limit and incur extra fees. Second, check the interest rate on your card and make sure you understand how it works. Finally, consider the repayment terms and make sure you can afford to pay off the balance in a reasonable amount of time.

**Alternatives to Credit Cards**

If you're not comfortable using a credit card for an emergency, there are other options available. You could consider a personal loan, which can offer a lower interest rate and more flexible repayment terms. You could also try to negotiate a payment plan with the service provider, such as a hospital or mechanic.

**The Bottom Line**

A credit card can be a helpful tool in an emergency, but it's not always the best option. By understanding the different types of credit cards available and the things to consider before using one, you can make an informed decision and avoid financial pitfalls.

0.53125,"Credit card interest rates are expected to remain largely unchanged in Q1 2024 as the Fed has held rates unchanged for the past six months after a prolonged period of rate increases that began in 2022 and continued in 2023. Most credit card issuers employ variable interest rates that are indexed to the Federal Reserve’s prime rate, so Fed rate policy largely impacts card interest rates directly. However, the lower and upper ends of available card rates can change from month to month depending on competitive pressures and individual banks' risk policies. The Federal Reserve pivoted to an aggressive policy of rate increases to its benchmark federal funds interest rate to combat rising inflation that began at the end of 2021. Specifically, due to dramatic increases in the consumer price index in Q4 of 2021 and in all four quarters of 2022, the Fed had indicated that interest rate hikes would continue to occur, though at a slower pace during the first half of 2023 as inflation moderated. The last five months of 2023 saw Fed rate increases hold as inflation did decrease significantly.
The last Fed funds rate increase was made in July 2023, for 0.25%, matching the previous increases of 25 basis points in May, March, and February of last year. Those increases were in addition to a string of 0.75% increases in the second half of 2022. As inflation has cooled over the past two quarters, the Fed announced it would keep rates steady at its most recent meeting on Jan. 31, 2024, and that it remains open to keeping rates unchanged going forward or potentially reducing them at its next meeting in March and in future meetings this year. Currently, 80% of interest rate traders are betting that the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting on March 20.3 A wide variety of consumer loans, including credit cards, are tied to movements of the Fed funds rate, which is the mechanism the Fed employs to stimulate or slow the magnitude of lending, depending on economic conditions.
Several factors influence how individual credit card rates are set, the most important of which is credit quality, with those with excellent credit receiving the lowest rates and those with no credit or bad credit receiving the highest rates. Other factors include the type of credit card and the risk-based pricing policies of the specific credit card issuer.
Investopedia tracks average advertised rates for new applicants, which are typically quoted as a range for each card product, across more than 300 card offers, which are shown below broken out by credit quality, card type, and card issuer.
Interest rates for credit cards tend to run in a similar range to those for personal loans. Credit cards are a type of revolving credit with variable interest rates whereas personal loans are typically fixed-rate for a specific amount and repayment term. Many consumers use balance transfer credit card offers to consolidate higher-interest credit card debt. Additionally, personal loans can also be used for debt consolidation involving credit card debt and other types of consumer debt.
Debt consolidation was the most frequent use for personal loans according to a survey conducted by Investopedia in September 2023.
Different ranges of credit quality can vary depending on the type of score used, but the most popular credit score used by credit card lenders is the FICO score.
For those needing to build or rebuild their credit, it's critical to begin actively using credit responsibly—which means always paying bills on time and keeping utilization below 30% of credit lines. A secured credit card can be a good place to start if you don't already have credit in your name. It can take time, but responsible credit use can produce positive results after as little as six months and builds over time.
Credit card issuers have different risk-based pricing policies that cause variation in the ranges of interest rates they advertise and eventually assign to customers based on approved applicants' credit scores.
Credit card interest rates are predominantly indexed to the prime rate along with a margin which varies at the card product level and individual account holder's credit quality. The prime rate currently stands at 8.50%, having risen 525 basis points since the beginning of 2022 following several rate increases by the Federal Reserve, which ended with an increase of 0.25% in July of 2023. The next Fed rate-setting meeting will conclude on March 20, 2024, and is expected to keep the fed funds rate unchanged.
Credit card delinquency rates, defined as accounts that are 90 days or more overdue, have been below 3% in recent years with a high point of 2.76% in January of 2020. However, during the pandemic the delinquency rate fell to a low of 1.48%, bottoming out in April of 2021. With the highest inflation in 40 years, caused by supply chain issues and increased consumer demand, driving higher spending on credit cards, the delinquency rate has risen significantly to 2.98% at the end of Q3 2023. This is up 21 basis points from Q2 2023 and up over 138 basis points since the beginning of the year, marking its highest level since Q1 2012.
Total consumer revolving credit card debt passed the $1 trillion mark just prior to the pandemic and then fell sharply to a low of $970 billion in January 2021. Since then revolving debt has climbed back beyond pre-pandemic levels to over $1.31 trillion for the most recent month reported by the Federal Reserve, November 2023,1 reflecting continued strong consumer demand and credit card spending. Pent-up consumer demand coupled with supply chain issues and resulting shortages of goods and services has also fueled record inflation levels not seen since the early 1980's. Fed increases to its discount rate charged to banks for overnight lending have a direct impact on credit card interest rates that adjust automatically, as they are pegged to the prime rate.
Investopedia tracks individual credit card rates on more than 300 network-branded cards offered to the public from 43 of the nation’s largest banks and issuers. Most credit card rates are advertised in the form of a range from low to high depending on the applicant’s credit score. In determining average rates by credit quality, card type, or card issuer, Investopedia calculates the average midpoint of advertised interest rate ranges and also calculates the average of the lower and upper ends of rates that are expressed in ranges.

For credit card accounts that were assessed interest, the average annual percentage rate was 16.44% as of November 2021, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Depending on your credit scores, the interest rate (aka APR) on your credit card may be higher or lower.
Good credit — a FICO credit score of 690 or higher — is key to securing a lower interest rate and saving money on credit card payments over time. A foolproof way to save on interest charges, though, is to pay off your credit card bill in full every month. That way, you'll avoid interest charges entirely.
Depending on the type of credit card, the average interest rate varies. Here’s a look at several different average interest rates for comparison.
» MORE: Does your credit card’s interest rate matter?
*The average interest rate for all credit card accounts includes those for cardholders who were not required to pay interest charges. You don’t have to pay interest charges if you have a 0% APR offer or if you pay off your credit card in full each month, for example.
**The average interest rate for credit card accounts assessed interest only includes those accounts in which cardholders were required to pay interest charges.
Credit card interest rates are based on several different factors. They're typically tied to the prime rate, which is the interest rate that banks charge their largest customers. When the prime rate increases, credit card rates usually do, too.
Some credit cards have different interest rates that fall within a range, like a purchase APR, balance transfer APR, penalty APR or cash advance APR. The specific rate you get is also based on your creditworthiness — your ability, in the eyes of the issuing bank, to pay back what you borrow. Banks determine this in part by looking at your credit scores.
While a credit card doesn’t have fixed monthly payments like a personal loan, it’s still money borrowed. Compared with some other loans, credit cards may have high interest rates to compensate for potential risk when cardholders can’t pay back their debt.
And different credit card types may have different interest rates. For instance, rewards credit cards and store credit cards tend to have higher interest rates. The average interest rate for a private label credit card in 2020 was 25.7%, according to data in a 2021 consumer credit card market report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB defines a private label card as a card that can be used with one merchant or a small group of related merchants only.
» MORE: How is credit card interest calculated?
While you can't fully control your interest rate, you may be able to lower it with a few strategies.
In general, the higher your credit scores, the lower your credit card APR will be.
For example, according to the CFPB report cited above, the average interest rate for general-purpose credit cards in 2020 ranged from 17.5% (for those with the highest credit scores) to 23.9% (for those with the lowest scores).
To achieve good credit — which, again, typically means FICO scores of 690 or higher — it’s important to pay bills on time, avoid using more than 30% of your available credit, and keep accounts open and active (when it makes sense). All of these are key ingredients that factor into credit scores.
By paying bills on time, you can also avoid a penalty APR, which is a higher interest rate that some issuers apply when you miss a credit card payment.
A low interest rate is ideal if you're carrying a balance on your credit card from month to month. And while your card's APR will hinge in part on your credit scores, there may be room to negotiate a lower rate with your credit card issuer if you're having trouble keeping up with payments.
If a low interest rate is a priority, you can also consider a credit union credit card. Your credit scores will still influence your interest rate, but these not-for-profit institutions are known to have lower interest rates compared with financial institutions like big banks. As of December 2021, the average interest rate for a credit card at a credit union was 11.21%, according to the National Credit Union Administration.
Ultimately, a ""good"" interest rate for a credit card is a bit of a moving target; your own rate will depend on your credit scores, the type of credit card you're applying for, the issuer of that card and economic factors like the prime rate.
Whether you want to pay less interest or earn more rewards, the right card's out there. Just answer a few questions and we'll narrow the search for you.

**Credit Card Interest Rates: What to Expect in Q1 2024**

As the Federal Reserve holds interest rates steady, credit card interest rates are expected to remain largely unchanged in Q1 2024. But how did we get here? Let's take a step back.

The Fed's aggressive rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 were aimed at combatting rising inflation. With inflation moderating, the Fed has put the brakes on further rate increases. This means credit card interest rates, which are tied to the prime rate, will likely stay put.

**How Credit Card Interest Rates are Set**

Credit card interest rates are influenced by a variety of factors, including credit quality, card type, and issuer risk policies. The prime rate, currently at 8.50%, provides the foundation for credit card interest rates.

**Average Credit Card Interest Rates**

Investopedia tracks credit card rates across more than 300 card offers, providing insight into average interest rates by credit quality, card type, and issuer. These rates are advertised as a range, with the midpoint serving as a benchmark.

**Debt Consolidation and Credit Card Interest Rates**

Debt consolidation was the most common use for personal loans in 2023, according to a survey by Investopedia. With credit card debt on the rise, consumers are turning to balance transfer credit card offers to consolidate higher-interest debt.

**Credit Card Delinquency Rates**

Credit card delinquency rates, defined as accounts 90 days or more overdue, have been steadily increasing. A combination of pent-up consumer demand, supply chain issues, and record inflation levels have contributed to this trend.

**Take Control of Your Credit Card Debt**

To avoid falling into the debt trap, it's essential to use credit responsibly. Pay your bills on time, keep utilization below 30%, and consider using a secured credit card to build or rebuild credit.

0.528795811518325,"ETFs and mutual funds have a lot in common. However, there are several key differences that could make one a better option for you than the other. In this article, we'll go over the similarities and differences and how to determine which of the two instruments is best for you.
An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment vehicle that pools money from investors and uses the funds to buy a basket of stocks, bonds, and other securities. Investors can buy and sell shares of an ETF just like they would buy shares of a stock from a stock exchange such as the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, hence the name exchange-traded fund.
ETFs commonly track a market index or commodity. Those tracking an index are called index funds. However, there is a growing number of actively managed ETFs. An active fund manager tries to outperform a benchmark index by being more selective with their stock picks.
In exchange for the convenience of an ETF, investors pay a fee to the fund company in the form of an expense ratio, or a percentage of assets under management. For heavily traded broad market index funds, where the fund manager's job is relatively simple, the expense ratio can be very low. For actively managed funds, where investors are paying for expert research and allocation management, the expense ratio climbs much higher.

A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools money from investors to buy a basket of stocks, bonds, and other securities. Investors buy shares of a mutual fund directly from the company issuing shares, such as Vanguard or Fidelity.
Mutual funds are more often actively managed compared to ETFs, but you can also buy mutual funds that track a market index. Again, index funds will generally have lower expense ratios than actively managed mutual funds, and the expense ratios are often identical to their ETF counterparts.
Since you must buy and hold shares of a mutual fund with the fund company issuing the shares, you won't be able to move the assets to another financial institution without selling.
If you're using the wrong credit or debit card, it could be costing you serious money. Our experts love this top pick, which features a 0% intro APR for 15 months, an insane cash back rate of up to 5%, and all somehow for no annual fee. In fact, this card is so good that our experts use it personally. Click here to read our full review for free and apply in just 2 minutes.
The differences between ETFs and mutual funds can have significant implications for investors.
One big difference to consider is how shares of the funds are priced. Since ETFs are bought and sold on a stock exchange, market forces dictate the value of the fund itself. If there's a sizable demand for the fund, it could be priced higher than its net asset value, which is the underlying value of the securities held by the fund.
The opposite is also true. If there's a sudden rush to sell shares of that specific fund, it could be priced below the net asset value. That's usually not an issue for most ETFs with high liquidity.
By comparison, mutual funds are always priced at their net asset value at the close of every trading day.
Another important consideration is tax efficiency. ETFs are usually more tax-efficient than mutual funds because ETF shares are traded on an exchange instead of redeemed with the mutual fund company, so there's a buyer for every seller. That might not be the case with a mutual fund, and a lot of sellers will cause the mutual fund company to sell shares of the underlying securities. That will have capital gains tax implications for all shareholders regardless of whether they sell.
Other differences -- such as the ability to buy fractional shares, commission fees, and minimum investments -- will vary based on the funds and brokers you're considering. Some mutual funds have very low minimums, and they'll go down further if you agree to invest on a regular schedule. Many online brokers have reduced their standard commission to $0 and allow investors to purchase fractional shares, so you're not leaving cash on the sidelines.
You can easily reinvest dividends from mutual funds just by checking a box, but the ability to reinvest dividends from an ETF will depend on whether your broker offers a dividend reinvestment plan for your preferred fund.
Exchange-traded funds let an investor buy lots of stocks and bonds at once.
Your investment style can dictate which kind of fund is best for your portfolio.

ETFs and mutual funds are both investment vehicles that can help you save for retirement. Here are the main differences.
Typically, mutual funds are run by a professional manager who attempts to beat the market by buying and selling stocks using their investing expertise. This is called active management, and it often translates into higher costs for investors. It can also mean worse performance, as fund managers are notoriously bad at predicting the market.
ETFs are usually passively managed funds. These funds automatically track a pre-selected index, such as the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq 100. However, there are a few actively managed ETFs, which function more like mutual funds and have higher fees as a result.
While actively managed funds may outperform ETFs in the short term, long-term results tell a different story. Between the higher expense ratios and the unlikelihood of beating the market over and over again, actively managed mutual funds often realize lower returns compared to ETFs over the long term.

An expense ratio indicates how much investors pay each year, as a percentage of the amount invested, to own a fund.
But don’t assume ETFs are always the cheapest option on the menu. It’s worth comparing ETFs and mutual funds when considering your investment options.
ETFs usually track an index, but they’re index funds with a twist: They’re traded throughout the day like stocks, with their prices based on supply and demand. On the other hand, traditional mutual funds, even those based on an index, are priced and traded at the end of each trading day.
The stock-like trading structure of ETFs also means that when you buy or sell, you might have to pay a commission. However, this is becoming increasingly uncommon as more and more major brokerages do away with commission fees. While that’s great news for ETF buyers, it’s important to remember that most brokers still require you to hold an ETF for a certain number of days, or they charge you a fee. ETFs aren’t normally intended for day-trading.
Because of how they’re managed, ETFs are usually more tax-efficient than mutual funds. This can be important if the ETF is held within a taxable account and not within a tax-advantaged retirement account, such as an IRA or 401(k). When an investor buys an ETF, you won't pay capital gains taxes unless the shares are eventually sold for a profit.
Mutual funds, on the other hand, are structured in a way that tends to incur higher capital gains taxes. Because they’re actively managed, the assets in a mutual fund are often bought and sold more frequently. When this is for a gain, the capital gains taxes are passed on to everyone with shares in the fund, even if you’ve never sold your shares.
Mutual funds can have high costs of entry: Even target-date mutual funds, which help novice investors save for specific goals, often have minimums of $1,000 or more. However, ETFs can be purchased by the share, lowering the cost of establishing a position or adding to an existing one.
Investors shouldn’t assume that any investment is low cost. It’s always important to look under the hood at all potential fees, and that’s true for ETFs, in spite of their reputation for being inexpensive. In general, however, ETFs give investors broad market exposure, and they can still provide great diversification with minimal fees.
One last point: If you’re not a hands-on investor, you may be happier in a target-date fund, which automatically rebalances for you. Investing in ETFs means taking on that duty or outsourcing it to a financial advisor or robo-advisor.

ETFs vs. Mutual Funds: Which is Best for You?

The world of investing can be a daunting place, with countless options vying for your attention. Two of the most popular investment vehicles are ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and mutual funds. While they share some similarities, there are key differences that could make one a better fit for your portfolio than the other.

Let's dive in and explore the similarities and differences between ETFs and mutual funds, and how to determine which one is best for you.

What is an ETF?

An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment vehicle that pools money from investors to buy a basket of stocks, bonds, and other securities. You can buy and sell shares of an ETF on a stock exchange, just like individual stocks. ETFs often track a market index or commodity, and some are actively managed by a fund manager who tries to outperform a benchmark index.

The convenience of an ETF comes at a cost, however. You'll pay a fee to the fund company in the form of an expense ratio, which is a percentage of assets under management. The expense ratio can be very low for broad market index funds, but it climbs higher for actively managed funds.

What is a Mutual Fund?

A mutual fund is another type of investment vehicle that pools money from investors to buy a basket of stocks, bonds, and other securities. The key difference is that you buy shares of a mutual fund directly from the company issuing the shares, rather than on a stock exchange.

Mutual funds are often actively managed, but you can also find index funds with lower expense ratios. Since you buy and hold shares of a mutual fund with the fund company, you won't be able to move the assets to another financial institution without selling.

The Differences that Matter

The differences between ETFs and mutual funds can have significant implications for investors. One key difference is how shares are priced. ETFs are traded on an exchange, so market forces dictate the value of the fund. This means the price could be higher or lower than the net asset value of the underlying securities. Mutual funds, on the other hand, are always priced at their net asset value at the close of every trading day.

Tax efficiency is another important consideration. ETFs are generally more tax-efficient than mutual funds because ETF shares are traded on an exchange, rather than redeemed with the mutual fund company. This reduces the capital gains tax implications for all shareholders.

Other differences, such as the ability to buy fractional shares, commission fees, and minimum investments, will vary depending on the funds and brokers you're considering.

Your Investment Style Matters

Your investment style can dictate which type of fund is best for your portfolio. If you're looking for convenience and flexibility, an ETF might be the way to go. On the other hand, if you're willing to hold shares of a mutual fund with the fund company, you might prefer a mutual fund.

Either way, it's essential to understand the differences between ETFs and mutual funds to make an informed decision. By doing your research and evaluating your investment goals, you can choose the right fund for your needs.

**ETFs vs. Mutual Funds: Which Is Best for You?**

When it comes to investing, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are two popular options. While they share some similarities, there are key differences to consider. In this article, we'll break down the pros and cons of each to help you decide which one is best for your portfolio.

**What's an ETF?**

An ETF is an investment vehicle that pools money from investors to buy a basket of stocks, bonds, and other securities. You can buy and sell ETF shares on a stock exchange, just like individual stocks. ETFs often track a specific market index or commodity, but some are actively managed, which means a fund manager tries to outperform a benchmark index.

**What's a Mutual Fund?**

A mutual fund is another type of investment vehicle that pools money from investors to buy a basket of stocks, bonds, and other securities. However, you buy shares directly from the company issuing the fund, such as Vanguard or Fidelity. Mutual funds are often actively managed, but you can also find index funds that track a specific market index.

**Key Differences**

So, what sets ETFs and mutual funds apart? One major difference is how shares are priced. ETFs are traded on an exchange, which means their value can fluctuate throughout the day. Mutual funds, on the other hand, are priced at their net asset value (NAV) at the end of each trading day.

Another important consideration is tax efficiency. ETFs are generally more tax-efficient than mutual funds because they don't have to sell securities to meet investor withdrawals, which can trigger capital gains taxes.

**Other Differences**

Other differences between ETFs and mutual funds include the ability to buy fractional shares, commission fees, and minimum investment requirements. Some mutual funds have low minimums, and you may be able to invest on a regular schedule. Many online brokers have reduced their standard commission to $0, making it easier to invest in ETFs.

**Which Is Best for You?**

Your investment style can dictate which type of fund is best for your portfolio. If you want to track a specific market index, an ETF or index fund might be a good choice. If you're looking for actively managed funds, mutual funds might be a better option.

Ultimately, understanding the differences between ETFs and mutual funds can help you make an informed decision about your investments.

0.521739130434783,"Okay, you've read our accounting software reviews, and have narrowed it down to two applications; FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online. Both are great choices, but which one would be best for your business? To make your decision a little easier, we're taking a look at both FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online.
FreshBooks was originally designed with the sole proprietor in mind, making it a good fit for service professionals, such as attorneys, architects, plumbers, designers, and anyone who works solo. But with four plans available, FreshBooks can also be used by growing businesses.
A great choice for those entering the business world for the first time, FreshBooks makes managing your business a breeze.
The QuickBooks name has been associated with small businesses for decades. QuickBooks applications have all been designed with small business in mind, and QuickBooks Online is no exception. With the introduction of QuickBooks Online, a flexible, accessible-from-anywhere application was born and has continued to evolve nicely.
While small businesses can outgrow QuickBooks Online at a certain point, the application can support up to 25 users, so it may take a while.
Both FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online are designed for small businesses, although FreshBooks' features fit much better for sole proprietors and consultants, while Quickbooks Online is a better solution for a growing business. One nice thing about both applications is that new features and enhancements are added on a regular basis.
FreshBooks has added a lot of new features in the last few years, so if you've looked at it before and passed, you may want to look again. Some of the new features include the addition of ACH payment acceptance, and a Retainers option, ideal for self-employed professionals such as attorneys or accountants.
Most importantly, FreshBooks has moved to double-entry accounting, so every financial transaction entered will have a corresponding transaction made. This addition alone makes FreshBooks a much stronger competitor with other online accounting applications.
The dashboard in FreshBooks offers a nice summary view of your business, including outstanding revenue, total profit, spending, and a chart that displays exactly where your money is going. FreshBooks invoicing is a simple process, and you can add a new client at the same time that you create their invoice.
Options to the right of the screen allow you to change the settings from invoice to invoice, including payment options.
You can also customize your invoice directly from the invoice entry screen or make any invoice recurring, if you wish. FreshBooks expense management is equally solid, allowing you to add a vendor and create an expense, make the expense recurring, and even mark the invoice as billable if it can be charged back to a client.
FreshBooks is designed to automatically import banking transactions, including expenses, so unfortunately there's no way to pay invoices with a check. Another nice feature that makes FreshBooks stand out is its time-tracking capability, which can be used when creating estimates, proposals, or invoices. Client and vendor management capability is limited, though you can add a reminders prompt that will go out when an invoice is past due.
You can also add late fees and choose your preferred currency and language for any client. FreshBooks will also allow you to invite your CPA or accountant to access your data at no extra charge.
QuickBooks Online offers many of the same features that you'll find in FreshBooks, such as quick invoice creation, the ability to make an invoice recurring, and the ability to customize an invoice directly within the software on the invoice entry screen. QuickBooks Online also offers retainer management, though it requires more data entry than its FreshBooks counterpart.
The features available in QuickBooks Online vary from plan to plan, with Simple Start offering basic features, while other plans offer time tracking, inventory, and bill payment capability. You can connect your banking institutions in QuickBooks Online for automatic reconciliation, assigning rules to particular accounts for automatic classification, which will eliminate the need to manually enter the expense.
QuickBooks Online also offers an Accountant option, so you can share your account with your CPA or accountant.
QuickBooks Online offers excellent customer and vendor management capability, something that is lacking in FreshBooks, with customer data such as billing and shipping addresses, notes, tax information, payment and billing details, and language preferences that can be adjusted in each customer account. You can also attach documents to any customer account, such as an invoice, statement, or other correspondence.
The same level of detail can be tracked for vendors for things like billing rates, terms, account number, and Tax I.D. number, along with the ability to track any vendor and contractor payments for year-end 1099 processing. Attachments can be managed in the vendor file as well.
QuickBooks Online is the winner. While FreshBooks offers many of the same features found in QuickBooks Online, the application offers better customer, contractor, and vendor management, and easier app connection.
The product model for software is much different than it was 20 years ago, with many of today's applications requiring little in the way of training or support. Software companies today provide their customers with numerous help resources like knowledge bases and in-product help options, but sometimes you just need to pick up the phone and talk to somebody. Both FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online offer live support options to their customers.
The winner is FreshBooks, which encourages telephone support as the first line of customer support. Yes, QuickBooks Online offers live support options as well, but QuickBooks Online strongly suggests other resources be accessed first.
Ease of use can play an important role when deciding which software application to purchase. As a business owner juggling multiple roles, the last thing you want is an accounting software application that requires extensive training.
Ideally, you should be able to look at the user interface and be able to figure out how to get to the features and functions you need, without referring to an instruction manual.
Both FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online are easy to use; both offer intuitive user interface screens as well as help options throughout each application.
The FreshBooks dashboard offers a nice welcome screen, which conveniently displays your setup progress. FreshBooks does prefer that the system be set up prior to using, but there are plenty of work-arounds for those that prefer to add as they go.
FreshBooks uses a vertical menu bar to the left of the screen, but once a category is chosen, a series of options and information is displayed on screen, including recent activity, a summary of all activity, and various actions that can be taken. Help is available from any screen in FreshBooks, and all data entry screens offer easy look-up options to help expedite the data entry process.
QuickBooks Online offers an easy setup process, so if you want to jump in and get started, you can just tend to the basics and add other details as you go along. QuickBooks Online includes an intuitive user interface, with a vertical menu bar to the left of the screen offering easy access to all system functions. Data entry screens contain solid look-up options in all fields, and you can access the help option from any screen in the application.
This one is a dead heat, with perhaps a slight edge given to FreshBooks for offering activity summaries and various task options in each category.
Pricing levels are similar in both FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online, though the main driving force behind FreshBooks' pricing levels is number of billable clients, versus number of system users for QuickBooks Online. Both offer similar features in each of their respective applications, with additional features in the more expensive plans.
QuickBooks Online has four plan options, starting with its single-user Simple Start plan, which costs $12.50/month for the first three months, to its Advanced plan, which supports up to 25 users.
FreshBooks, though it's close. Remember, while QuickBooks Online comes in slightly lower than FreshBooks, initial pricing for QuickBooks Online typically increases after the first three months, whereas FreshBooks pricing remains the same from month to month.
Older accounting software applications were frequently loaded with every feature and function you could think of, resulting in a bloated, overpriced application.
Today's online applications are streamlined, offering solid accounting functionality, while integrating with numerous apps designed to provide you with the tools you need.
For instance, instead of including a CRM feature, the product offers integration with CRM apps, eliminating bloating and keeping the prices within reach of small business owners.
FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online both offer good integration options, which can extend product functionality tremendously.
FreshBooks offers integration with more than 200 apps, including Gusto Payroll, Stripe for online payment acceptance, and Avalara Tax for easy tax management. Integrations with e-commerce, inventory, CRM, and time-tracking apps are also available. In addition, you can connect to more than 1,500 apps using Zapier.
QuickBooks Online lets you connect with apps from within the application. By clicking on the Apps feature, you can search for an app, browse popular apps, and view any recommended apps.
There are apps in a variety of categories, including online payment apps such as Stripe and PayPal, as well as Bill Pay for QuickBooks, which allows you to pay bills from within QuickBooks Online. There are also numerous CRM and time-tracking apps you can easily connect to.
No clear winner in this one, since both FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online offer easy connection from within their respective application to connect with numerous apps in a variety of categories.
Only you know how important reporting is to your business. If you have the financial statements you need, do you still care how many other reports are available, or do you want as many reporting options as possible?
FreshBooks offers a total of 14 reports, with limited customization capability, though you can export those reports to Microsoft Excel for customization if desired. FreshBooks does offer a nice report management screen, where you can save your favorites for easy future access, but reports are limited to financial statements and basic management reports. Reports can also be saved as a PDF.
QuickBooks Online includes more than 50 standard reports in a variety of categories. You can also create and save custom reports in this FreshBooks alternative, export reports to Excel for further customization, or save any report as a PDF.
With their 50-plus reports available, QuickBooks Online wins the reporting contest hands-down. While FreshBooks reports are useful and provide the information you need, QuickBooks Online offers a much better variety of reports with much better customization options available.

Deciding between FreshBooks and QuickBooks depends on how big your business is now and how big it will get. Freelancers and independent contractors may find all of the basic accounting functions they need with FreshBooks, and for a lower price point than QuickBooks, to boot.
But QuickBooks goes beyond basic accounting, with hundreds of app integrations, detailed inventory tracking in higher-tier plans and customizable reporting. Plus, it’s easy to scale and share with your accountant — all features you’d expect from the best accounting software for small businesses.
While QuickBooks has many different accounting products, QuickBooks Online is most comparable to FreshBooks. When we mention QuickBooks in this comparison, we’re referring specifically to QuickBooks Online.
Has a strong invoicing feature; app lets users send invoices on the go, scan receipts and track mileage; basic inventory tracking for billable items; least expensive plan lacks double-entry accounting reports.
Has robust reporting tools and report customization options, invoicing for an unlimited amount of clients, inventory tracking in higher tier plans, plus a capable mobile app.
Auto-categorizes transactions for you, but you can’t set up your own bank rules; no global search function; least expensive plan lacks bank reconciliation tools.
Includes tools that help automate the reconciliation process, along with a global search function and customizable dashboard; however, there is a learning curve.
Can support freelancers, contractors and small businesses with a handful of employees; highest-tier plan includes two users (additional users can be added for a fee).

Least expensive plan doesn’t allow accountant access; lacks complete audit trail.
Includes audit trails and easy accountant access; has millions of users so your accountant will likely be familiar with it.
Integrates with more than 100 third-party apps; limited choices for direct payroll and point-of-sale integrations.
Integrates with more than 750 apps and offers live, in-house bookkeeping add-on.
Includes phone support in all plans 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET from Monday to Friday; offers email support, but not live chat support with a human.
All plans include 24/7 live chat support; phone support is available 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. PST Monday through Friday, and 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. PST Saturday and Sunday.

QuickBooks has four subscription tiers that layer on reporting and bookkeeping functions to accommodate everyone from freelancers and service-based businesses to small companies with complex workflows and inventory management needs.
Upgraded QuickBooks plans also include multiple users, so you can share the workload with or among employees. The highest-tier Advanced plan, for example, lets you add up to 25 users. FreshBooks, on the other hand, charges $11 per month per additional user and is better suited for contractors and freelancers. Each FreshBooks plan comes with just one user with the exception of the custom Select plan, which includes two. While FreshBooks also has different subscription tiers, its reporting capabilities and other functions aren’t as varied or advanced as QuickBooks.
While both software solutions offer features like mileage tracking, inventory management and reporting, QuickBooks' capabilities typically exceed those of FreshBooks.
Inventory managementIf you manage a small amount of inventory and need basic tracking functions, FreshBooks can get the job done. QuickBooks goes beyond basic inventory tracking, with reorder points and the ability to purchase inventory directly from within the platform. You also can set pricing rules to customize rates, and run inventory reports to find out which products are your best sellers and which carry the highest cost. QuickBooks' inventory features are available only in Plus and Advanced plans. FreshBooks, on the other hand, offers basic inventory tracking in all plans.
FreshBooks’ least expensive Lite plan doesn’t allow for accountant access, which can be limiting for micro businesses that want an accountant to look over their financials every so often. And regardless of plan tier, the software doesn’t provide audit trails, which help your accountant verify information and catch errors. Alternatively, QuickBooks includes accountant access in all plans. And thanks to the software’s popularity, most accountants should be familiar with it.
QuickBooks is the more expensive option at all plan levels, and FreshBooks’ lower price tag may be the deciding factor for freelancers looking for a simple, mobile-friendly bookkeeping solution. For example, all FreshBooks plans let you re-bill expenses to clients. You’d have to subscribe to QuickBooks’ Plus plan ($90 per month) or higher to access that feature. All FreshBooks plans boast other features that are particularly useful for freelancers, like the ability to chat back and forth with clients via the mobile app and find out when a client has viewed an invoice.
While QuickBooks does offer a more scaled-back product for freelancers and gig workers — QuickBooks Self-Employed starts at $15 per month — you can’t seamlessly grow into QuickBooks from this version.
Time tracking is easy and automatic with FreshBooks, and it's included with all plans. You can log in online to track your time or mark it via the mobile app, a browser extension or a third-party app like Asana. You also can record time by project and bill for tracked hours. QuickBooks offers automatic time tracking through QuickBooks Time, but it costs extra, regardless of which plan you choose. And you need to subscribe to QuickBooks’ Essentials plan ($60 per month) or up to enter billable time and add it to invoices.
Pricing: $13 per month and up.
Xero, a popular alternative to QuickBooks and FreshBooks, has more than 3 million subscribers worldwide and allows unlimited users in every plan tier. It also integrates with more than 1,000 apps. While all of its plans include bank reconciliation (unlike FreshBooks), its lowest-tier Early plan doesn’t let users send more than 20 invoices, enter five bills or claim expenses.
Wave, a free accounting software product, offers unlimited invoicing, unlimited income and expense tracking, unlimited users and basic reporting. While it can’t necessarily support a quickly growing small business, it’s a great solution for very small service-based businesses with a tight budget. The company also offers its own Wave Payroll solution — just keep in mind that it only handles payroll taxes in some states and isn’t free.
$13 per month and up.
Unlimited users in all plans.
Free income and expense tracking.
Built-in integrations with other Zoho suite products.
24/5 phone and chat support for paying customers.
$10 per month and up.
Monthly subscription costs top out at $25.

FreshBooks vs. QuickBooks Online: Which Accounting Software is Right for Your Business?

When it comes to choosing the right accounting software for your business, it can be a daunting task. You've narrowed it down to two top contenders: FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online. But which one is the better fit for your business needs?

FreshBooks: A Great Fit for Solo Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses

FreshBooks was initially designed with solo entrepreneurs in mind, making it an excellent choice for service professionals, such as attorneys, architects, and designers. With four plans available, FreshBooks can also accommodate growing businesses. Its user-friendly interface makes it easy to manage your business, regardless of your accounting expertise.

One of the standout features of FreshBooks is its recent addition of double-entry accounting, which provides a more accurate and reliable financial picture. The dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of your business, including outstanding revenue, total profit, and expenses. You can easily create invoices, track expenses, and manage projects with FreshBooks.

QuickBooks Online: A Solid Choice for Small Businesses

QuickBooks Online, on the other hand, is designed with small businesses in mind. With the ability to support up to 25 users, it's an excellent choice for businesses that are growing rapidly. QuickBooks Online offers a flexible and accessible platform that can be easily customized to meet your business needs.

One of the significant advantages of QuickBooks Online is its excellent customer and vendor management capabilities. You can track detailed information about your customers, including billing and shipping addresses, payment history, and language preferences. Additionally, you can attach documents to customer accounts, making it easy to manage your relationships.

Head-to-Head Comparison: FreshBooks vs. QuickBooks Online

So, which accounting software is right for your business? Here's a breakdown of the key features and benefits of each:

**Customer Support:** FreshBooks offers more personalized customer support, with a focus on telephone support as the first line of defense. QuickBooks Online also offers live support options, but encourages users to explore other resources first.

**Ease of Use:** Both FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online are easy to use, with intuitive interfaces and comprehensive help resources. However, FreshBooks has a slight edge due to its more comprehensive setup process and activity summaries.

**Pricing:** FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online have similar pricing structures, with the main difference being the number of billable clients versus the number of system users. QuickBooks Online has a slight edge in terms of pricing, but FreshBooks offers more consistent pricing month-to-month.

**Integration:** Both FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online offer excellent integration options with various apps, including CRM, e-commerce, and time-tracking tools. However, FreshBooks has a more extensive range of integrations, with over 200 apps available.

**Reporting:** QuickBooks Online offers a more comprehensive range of reporting options, with over 50 standard reports available. FreshBooks, on the other hand, offers 14 reports, with limited customization capabilities.

Which Accounting Software is Right for Your Business?

Ultimately, the choice between FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online depends on your specific business needs. If you're a solo entrepreneur or small business with simple accounting needs, FreshBooks may be the better fit. However, if you're a growing business with more complex accounting requirements, QuickBooks Online may be the better choice.

Remember, the right accounting software can make all the difference in the success of your business. Take the time to explore your options and choose the one that best fits your needs.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of NerdWallet:

**FreshBooks vs. QuickBooks Online: Which Accounting Software is Best for Your Business?**

You've narrowed down your accounting software search to two top contenders: FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online. Both are excellent choices, but which one is the best fit for your business? We'll break down the key features, pricing, and pros and cons of each to help you make an informed decision.

**FreshBooks: Designed for Solo Proprietors and Small Businesses**

FreshBooks was initially created with solo proprietors in mind, making it an excellent choice for service professionals like attorneys, architects, and designers. However, with four plan options, it can also cater to growing businesses.

One of FreshBooks' strengths is its ease of use, making it an excellent choice for those new to accounting software. The dashboard provides a clear summary of your business, including outstanding revenue, total profit, and spending.

**QuickBooks Online: A Robust Solution for Small Businesses**

QuickBooks Online is part of the well-established QuickBooks family, designed specifically for small businesses. With its flexible and accessible-from-anywhere application, it's an excellent choice for businesses that need to manage their finances on the go.

QuickBooks Online offers many of the same features as FreshBooks, including quick invoice creation, customization options, and excellent customer and vendor management capabilities.

**Head-to-Head Comparison: Features, Pricing, and More**

Both FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online offer a range of features, including invoicing, expense tracking, and project management. Here's a detailed comparison of the two:

* **Features:** FreshBooks offers a more comprehensive set of features, including ACH payment acceptance, retainers, and double-entry accounting. QuickBooks Online, on the other hand, excels in customer and vendor management.
* **Pricing:** FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online have similar pricing structures, with plans starting at $12.50/month and $10/month, respectively.
* **Ease of use:** Both applications are user-friendly, but FreshBooks has a slight edge in this department, thanks to its intuitive interface and setup process.
* **Integrations:** Both FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online offer a range of integrations with third-party apps, including payment gateways, CRM tools, and more.

**The Verdict: Which Accounting Software is Right for You?**

Ultimately, the choice between FreshBooks and QuickBooks Online depends on your business needs. If you're a solo proprietor or small business with simple accounting needs, FreshBooks might be the way to go. However, if you need more robust features, including advanced customer and vendor management, QuickBooks Online is the better choice.

0.517241379310345,"Investing in individual stocks can make some investors nervous due to the amount of necessary research and the risk associated with volatility in the market. One way to quiet those nerves is to place your money into exchange-traded funds that follow a market or sector index and are managed by a financial institution. Each ETF holds positions in a group of stocks and can be traded in real-time, just like stocks.
Three healthcare ETFs that provide long-term investors with diversification, along with growth opportunities to outpace the S&P 500, include Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT 0.14%), Blackrock iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF 1.00%), and Blackrock iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI -0.24%).
The average expense ratio for ETFs has trended downward since 2008, driven by an injection of new ETFs on the market, giving investors an opportunity to increase their gains. But even at an average rate of 0.18% for asset-weighted funds, Vanguard comes in lower at 0.10%. With no minimum investment and a low expense ratio, it removes potential front-end obstacles that might scare away some investors.
This healthcare ETF also provides investors with an expansive diversification of stocks within the sector, including companies that sell medical products, services, equipment, and technology. The aim is to track the performance of a benchmark index, but 25% of the holdings are weighted toward pharmaceuticals. Moreover, 44% of its total assets are in its top-10 holdings, including Abbott Laboratories, AbbVie, and UnitedHealth, strong companies to hold for the long term.
Because the fund aims to track the healthcare index as a whole, it should continue to benefit from two growth areas. First, the pharmaceutical market is projected to grow at a 5.7% compound annual rate through 2026. Second, the population of people reaching age 65 over the next 10 years is expected to increase, leading to more spending on Medicare and Medicaid services.
Topping off the benefits of this ETF is a 1.14% dividend yield, which amounted to a $3.05-per-share distribution in dividends for 2021, and leads the pack of these three ETFs. A 15% average annualized return over the past 10 years is impressive as well.
When long-term investors look to build out a portfolio, it's a good practice to compile a few investments that serve with consistency to support a foundational base. This ETF has provided positive returns in 13 of the 14 years since its inception.
Comparing it to the Vanguard healthcare ETF, there are some similarities and some trade-offs. Similarities include UnitedHealth as a top holding, which has been a rocket ship of growth, and has the right stuff to keep it going. But the rest of the top holdings are led by healthcare providers, including pharmacy market leader CVS. At the same time, its average annualized return of 17.3% over the past 10 years exceeds that of the Vanguard ETF.
The minor trade-off to the higher returns is that this ETF carries an expense ratio of 0.42%, which more closely resembles the 0.47% average of a simple, non-asset-weighted ETF. This basically means you're paying more for your gains.
But when the returns average 2% higher per year than Vanguard's ETF, they can make up for that higher expense ratio -- assuming that this winning streak can continue. And the heavier reliance on healthcare providers, as opposed to pharmaceuticals, can provide balance when letting both ETFs work in tandem for your portfolio.
A third healthcare ETF for a solid portfolio could be the Blackrock U.S. Medical Devices ETF. If it's higher returns you're looking for from your ETF, you'll find it here, at a 19% average annualized total return over the past 10 years compared to the S&P 500 Healthcare average of 15.9%.
But like Blackrock's healthcare provider ETF, this medical devices-focused ETF has a heavy 72% of its total assets in the top 10 holdings, making it riskier than an ETF that is more broadly spread out. Other trade-offs to its higher returns include a higher 0.42% expense ratio and a slightly lower consistency rate of years with positive returns.  It also delivers a lower dividend compared to each of the other two ETFs highlighted, at only 0.33%.
Holdings like Abbott Labs, Intuitive Surgical, and Medtronic have helped pace this large-growth ETF. It should benefit from a projected compound annual growth rate of 5.4% for the medical devices market through 2028, driven by such advancements in technology as artificial intelligence and robotics.
The chart below shows the 10-year annualized return for each of these three ETFs compared to that of the broader S&P 500 and S&P 500 Healthcare indices. As you can see, both S&P averages fall below all three of these healthcare-focused ETFs.
While all three could be good additions to your portfolio, each may serve its purpose depending on your investment stage. Younger investors may opt to go with a higher-risk approach for higher potential annual returns, whereas someone closing in on retirement may want to go with an ETF that can deliver more consistency with less risk. Meanwhile, a higher-dividend-paying ETF can help generate some quarterly income and benefit investors at all stages.

Investing in Individual Stocks: Mitigating Risk with ETFs

Investing in individual stocks can be a daunting task, particularly for those who are new to the world of investing. The volatility of the market and the sheer amount of research required to make informed investment decisions can be overwhelming. One way to alleviate these concerns is to opt for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track a specific market or sector index. These funds are managed by financial institutions and offer a diversified portfolio of stocks that can be traded in real-time, just like individual stocks.

Healthcare ETFs: A Diversified Approach to Growth

For long-term investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and outpace the S&P 500, three healthcare ETFs stand out: Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT), BlackRock iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF), and BlackRock iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI). These ETFs provide a diversified approach to investing in the healthcare sector, offering exposure to a range of companies involved in medical products, services, equipment, and technology.

The Vanguard Health Care ETF, with an expense ratio of 0.10%, offers a low-cost option for investors. The fund tracks the performance of a benchmark index, with 25% of its holdings weighted towards pharmaceuticals. The top-10 holdings, including strong companies like Abbott Laboratories, AbbVie, and UnitedHealth, account for 44% of the fund's total assets.

Growing Demand in the Healthcare Sector

The healthcare sector is poised for growth, driven by two key areas. Firstly, the pharmaceutical market is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 5.7% through 2026. Secondly, the increasing population of people reaching age 65 over the next 10 years is expected to lead to higher spending on Medicare and Medicaid services.

In addition to its growth potential, the Vanguard Health Care ETF offers a 1.14% dividend yield, which translates to a $3.05-per-share distribution in dividends for 2021. The fund has provided positive returns in 13 of the 14 years since its inception, making it a consistent performer.

Comparing ETFs: A Balanced Approach

When building a portfolio, it's essential to compile a few investments that serve as a foundational base. The Vanguard Health Care ETF and the BlackRock iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF share some similarities, including UnitedHealth as a top holding. However, the BlackRock ETF carries an expense ratio of 0.42%, which is higher than the Vanguard ETF. The trade-off is a higher average annualized return of 17.3% over the past 10 years.

A third option, the BlackRock U.S. Medical Devices ETF, offers an average annualized total return of 19% over the past 10 years, compared to the S&P 500 Healthcare average of 15.9%. While this ETF has a higher expense ratio and a lower consistency rate of years with positive returns, it may appeal to investors seeking higher returns.

Portfolio Diversification: A Balanced Approach

When building a portfolio, it's essential to diversify across different asset classes and sectors. The three healthcare ETFs mentioned above can serve as a solid foundation for long-term investors. However, it's crucial to consider individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon before making any investment decisions.

The chart below shows the 10-year annualized return for each of the three ETFs compared to the broader S&P 500 and S&P 500 Healthcare indices. As you can see, all three healthcare-focused ETFs outperform the S&P averages.

<i>Chart: 10-Year Annualized Return Comparison</i>

Investing in the healthcare sector can provide a growth opportunity for long-term investors. By diversifying across different ETFs and considering individual financial goals, investors can create a balanced portfolio that meets their needs.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Investopedia:

**Investing in Healthcare ETFs: A Long-Term Strategy**

Investing in individual stocks can be a daunting task for many investors, given the required research and market volatility. One way to mitigate these concerns is to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track a market or sector index, providing diversification and professional management. Three healthcare ETFs that offer long-term growth opportunities and diversification benefits are the Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT), Blackrock iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF), and Blackrock iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI).

**Low Expenses and Diversification Benefits**

The average expense ratio for ETFs has trended downward since 2008, driven by the increasing competition in the market. The Vanguard Health Care ETF, with an expense ratio of 0.10%, offers an attractive option for investors seeking low fees. Additionally, this ETF provides an expansive diversification of stocks within the healthcare sector, including companies that sell medical products, services, equipment, and technology.

**Growth Opportunities and Index Tracking**

The healthcare sector is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 5.7% through 2026, driven by an aging population and increasing healthcare spending. The pharmaceutical market, which accounts for 25% of the Vanguard Health Care ETF's holdings, is also expected to grow at a rapid pace. The fund's aim to track the performance of a benchmark index ensures that investors can benefit from these growth areas.

**Dividend Yield and Consistency**

The Vanguard Health Care ETF offers a dividend yield of 1.14%, which is attractive for income-seeking investors. Additionally, the fund has provided positive returns in 13 of the 14 years since its inception, demonstrating its consistency and ability to provide a foundational base for a portfolio.

**Comparison to Other Healthcare ETFs**

Compared to the Blackrock iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF, the Vanguard Health Care ETF offers a similar investment approach, with a focus on healthcare providers such as UnitedHealth. However, the Blackrock ETF carries a higher expense ratio of 0.42%, which may be a trade-off for its higher returns. The Blackrock iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF, with a higher expense ratio of 0.42%, offers a more focused investment approach on medical devices, with a higher average annualized return of 19% over the past 10 years.

**Conclusion**

Investing in healthcare ETFs can provide a long-term growth strategy for investors, with the potential for diversification benefits and index tracking. The Vanguard Health Care ETF, with its low expense ratio and consistent performance, offers an attractive option for investors seeking a foundational base for their portfolio. However, investors may also consider the Blackrock iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF and Blackrock iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF, depending on their investment objectives and risk tolerance.","Here is the comprehensive style guide for Investopedia in valid JSON format:

0.510574018126888,"A 401(k) is a tax-advantaged retirement account, so the government sets limits on how much you can contribute every year. But it also understands that inflation makes retirement more expensive over time, so it reevaluates its limits every year and sometimes raises them. Here's an overview of all of the contribution limits the government imposes on 401(k)s in 2023 and 2024.
When most people think of 401(k) contribution limits, they are thinking of the elective deferral limit, which is $23,000 for 2024 ($22,500 in 2023). This is the maximum amount you are allowed to voluntarily defer to your 401(k) for the year.
Adults 50 and older are also allowed $7,500 in catch-up contributions, which are additional elective deferrals, in both 2023 and 2024. This brings the maximum amount they can contribute to their 401(k)s to $30,500 in 2024 ($30,000 in 2023).
The IRS also imposes a limit on all 401(k) contributions made during the year. These limits increase to $69,000 and $76,500, respectively, in 2024. In 2023, the limits were $66,000, or $73,500 for people 50 and older. This includes all your personal contributions and any money your employer contributes to your 401(k) on your behalf.
Highly paid employees have some additional limitations to keep in mind. Companies can elect to stop a participant's salary deferrals once that person has earned $330,000 in 2023, or $345,000 in 2024, and companies use only that first amount to calculate employer matching contributions.
For example, say your company matches up to 5% of your salary and you earn $400,000 in 2024. Five percent of $400,000 is $20,000; however, your company can only match you up to 5% of $345,000, the maximum employee compensation limit for 2024. So rather than up to $20,000, you'd get up to $17,250 (5% of $345,000) as an employer match.
You may face additional limitations if you're a highly compensated employee (HCE) or a key employee. These are employees who meet at least one of the following criteria: own 5% or more of their company; earn more than $150,000 in 2023, or $155,000 in 2024; or, if the company elects, they rank in the top 20% of employees for compensation.
If you're using the wrong credit or debit card, it could be costing you serious money. Our experts love this top pick, which features a 0% intro APR for 15 months, an insane cash back rate of up to 5%, and all somehow for no annual fee. In fact, this card is so good that our experts use it personally. Click here to read our full review for free and apply in just 2 minutes.
Some employers match a portion of their employees' 401(k) contributions as an additional incentive. These contributions do not count against your elective deferral limit, but they do count against your maximum annual contribution limit. So if you're under 50 and you contribute the maximum $23,000 to your 401(k) in 2024, your employer is able to contribute a maximum of $46,000 on your behalf.
Matching contributions are the most common type of employer contribution. This means your employer contributes a percentage of your income based on how much you've contributed yourself. For example, it might match $0.50 on the dollar up to 6% of your income, or it might give you a dollar-for-dollar match up to 3% of your income. Every plan has its own rules and restrictions, so you must talk with your employer to learn about how its matching system works.
Companies can also make nonelective contributions, whereby they add funds to employees' 401(k)s regardless of whether the employee contributes money themselves. These are less common, but some companies offer them instead of or in addition to matching contributions. Nonelective contributions also count against your maximum annual contribution limit.
All 401(k)s are subject to annual nondiscrimination tests to ensure the plans don't provide unfair advantages to highly compensated employees (HCEs) and key employees that lower-earning employees don't get. These tests ensure HCEs aren't contributing substantially more of their earnings or receiving more in employer contributions compared to non-HCEs. They also place limitations on how much of a 401(k) plan's assets can be in the hands of HCEs. Failing a nondiscrimination test could result in the 401(k) plan losing its tax benefits, so companies want to avoid this at all costs.
Companies that fail can remedy the situation in a few ways. First, they can provide additional nonelective contributions to lower-earning employees to bring the plan into compliance, or they can place additional limits on HCE contributions, refunding them in some cases if employees have already contributed too much for the year. They can also do a combination of the two.
If you earn six figures, you may be considered a highly compensated employee, which can affect your 401(k) contributions.
So what do you do if you contributed too much to your 401(k)?
So can you have both? Yes, with some limitations.
If your 401(k) is going in the wrong direction, learn what to do.
If a company has to limit HCE contributions, they may not be able to contribute the full sums listed in the table above. Their maximum contribution limits depend in part on how much lower-earning employees are contributing to their 401(k)s. HCEs should talk to their company's HR department to learn about how much they're eligible to contribute annually.
It sounds like a lot to keep track of, but for most people, the only limit to worry about is the elective deferral limit for the year. If you have any questions about how your plan works or you're worried about exceeding the contribution limits in the table above, reach out to your company's HR department for more information.

If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, it can be one of the easiest and most effective ways to save for your retirement. But while a major advantage of 401(k) plans is that they let you put a portion of your pay automatically into your account, there are limits to how much you may contribute.
However, if you have extra funds to sock away and your company offers an after-tax 401(k) contribution option, you can contribute more.4 In 2024, the total combined limit, including elective employee deferrals, after-tax contributions, and employer matching funds, is $69,000 (or $76,500 if you're 50 or older). In 2023, the limit was $66,000 ($73,500 for those 50 or older).
Another big benefit of participating in a 401(k) plan is that your employer may contribute to it on your behalf, as well. Many employers match employee contributions by adding, for example, 50 cents or $1 for every dollar the employee contributes.
Employers can also make elective contributions regardless of how much or little the employee contributes, up to certain limits. The limit on total employer and employee contributions for 2024 is $69,000. When you include the $7,500 catch-up contribution, that limit becomes $76,500.
If you earn a very high salary, you may be considered a highly compensated employee (HCE), subject to more stringent contribution limits. To prevent wealthier employees from benefiting unfairly from the tax benefits of 401(k) plans, the IRS uses the actual deferral percentage (ADP) test to ensure that employees of all compensation levels participate proportionately in their companies' plans.
Every year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues updates for the maximum amount of money employees may contribute to their 401(k) plans. For 2024, that amount is $23,000, with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those aged 50 and over. For 2023, the maximum contribution amounts were $22,500 and $7,500 for catch-up contributions.
Make the most of your yearly opportunity to save toward retirement by maxing out your contribution amounts, if possible. Moreover, be sure to take advantage of employer-matching contributions, if they're offered, to boost your retirement savings each year.

**401(k) Contribution Limits for 2023 and 2024: What You Need to Know**

The 401(k) is a tax-advantaged retirement account that allows individuals to set aside a portion of their income for their golden years. However, the government sets limits on how much can be contributed each year to prevent abuse and ensure fairness. In this article, we will delve into the 401(k) contribution limits for 2023 and 2024, and explore the implications for individuals and employers.

**Elective Deferral Limit: The Basics**

The elective deferral limit is the maximum amount an individual can contribute to their 401(k) account voluntarily. For 2024, this limit is $23,000, up from $22,500 in 2023. This limit applies to all 401(k) plans, including those offered by employers and self-directed plans.

**Catch-Up Contributions: A Bonus for Older Workers**

Workers aged 50 and older are eligible to make additional catch-up contributions to their 401(k) accounts. These contributions are designed to help older workers save more for retirement. In 2023 and 2024, the catch-up contribution limit is $7,500, which brings the total contribution limit for older workers to $30,500 in 2024 and $30,000 in 2023.

**Total Contribution Limit: A Ceiling for All Contributions**

The total contribution limit is the maximum amount that can be contributed to a 401(k) account in a given year, including both employee and employer contributions. In 2024, this limit is $69,000, up from $66,000 in 2023. For workers aged 50 and older, the total contribution limit is $76,500 in 2024, up from $73,500 in 2023.

**Highly Paid Employees: Additional Limitations**

Highly paid employees, defined as those earning $330,000 in 2023 or $345,000 in 2024, may face additional limitations on their 401(k) contributions. Employers may also limit matching contributions to these employees, which can affect their overall retirement savings.

**Employer Contributions: Matching and Nonelective Contributions**

Employers can make two types of contributions to their employees' 401(k) accounts: matching and nonelective contributions. Matching contributions are tied to employee contributions, while nonelective contributions are made regardless of employee contributions. Both types of contributions count towards the total contribution limit.

**Nondiscrimination Tests: Ensuring Fairness**

401(k) plans are subject to annual nondiscrimination tests to ensure that they do not favor highly compensated employees or key employees. These tests aim to ensure that all employees have equal access to retirement benefits.

**Contribution Limits and Employer Matching: A Complex Dance**

Highly paid employees and key employees may face additional limitations on their 401(k) contributions, which can affect their employer matching contributions. Employers may need to adjust their matching contributions to ensure that they comply with nondiscrimination tests.

**What to Do If You Contribute Too Much**

If you contribute too much to your 401(k) account, you may need to take corrective action to avoid penalties. It's essential to review your contribution limits and adjust your contributions accordingly.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, understanding 401(k) contribution limits is crucial for individuals and employers alike. By knowing the limits and how they apply, you can make informed decisions about your retirement savings and ensure compliance with tax laws.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Investopedia:

Understanding 401(k) Contribution Limits for 2023 and 2024

The U.S. government has established contribution limits for 401(k) plans to encourage retirement savings while also controlling the tax benefits associated with these plans. As inflation rises, the government periodically reviews and adjusts these limits to ensure they remain effective. Here's a breakdown of the 401(k) contribution limits for 2023 and 2024.

Elective Deferral Limit

The elective deferral limit is the most well-known contribution limit, and it's the maximum amount you can voluntarily defer to your 401(k) account each year. For 2024, the elective deferral limit is $23,000, an increase from $22,500 in 2023.

Catch-Up Contributions

If you're 50 or older, you're eligible for catch-up contributions, which are additional elective deferrals. The catch-up contribution limit remains at $7,500 for both 2023 and 2024. This means that if you're 50 or older, your total 401(k) contribution limit is $30,500 in 2024 ($30,000 in 2023).

Total 401(k) Contribution Limit

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also sets a limit on all 401(k) contributions made during the year, including your personal contributions and employer contributions. For 2024, the total contribution limit is $69,000, up from $66,000 in 2023. If you're 50 or older, the limit increases to $76,500 in 2024 ($73,500 in 2023).

Highly Compensated Employees

Highly compensated employees (HCEs) may face additional limitations. Companies can stop a participant's salary deferrals once they reach a certain income threshold, which is $330,000 in 2023 and $345,000 in 2024. This limit affects employer matching contributions as well.

Nondiscrimination Tests

All 401(k) plans are subject to annual nondiscrimination tests to ensure the plans don't unfairly benefit HCEs. These tests aim to prevent HCEs from contributing significantly more to their 401(k) accounts or receiving more employer contributions than non-HCEs. If a plan fails these tests, it may lose its tax benefits.

Consequences of Exceeding Contribution Limits

If you contribute too much to your 401(k) account, you may need to take corrective action to avoid penalties and taxes. It's essential to understand the contribution limits and plan rules to avoid these issues.

In conclusion, understanding the 401(k) contribution limits is crucial for effective retirement planning. While these limits may seem complex, they're designed to encourage saving and ensure fair access to retirement benefits. By staying informed, you can make the most of your 401(k) plan and achieve your long-term financial goals.","Here is the complete style guide in valid JSON format:

0.5,"Don't assume your credit limit is set in stone.
If you have a credit card, then you also have a limit on how much you are allowed to charge on it. Card companies decide how large your line of credit should be based on many factors, including your income and your credit score.
In some cases, however, this limit could actually change after you become a customer. There are even circumstances where a credit card company could end up lowering the limit and leaving you with less available credit. Here's why that could happen -- and why it has serious consequences.
In general, most credit card companies have broad discretion in when they can lower your limit. And they can do this even if you don't want them to.
Card issuers could also adjust your credit line if there is overall economic turmoil going on, and/or if they simply wish to adjust their lending portfolios. But, most often, a reduced credit line is targeted by your specific spending behavior with the card.
If your card company decides to lower your credit limit, this could be a big issue because it could hurt your credit score.
See, the second most important factor in determining your credit score is your credit utilization ratio. Credit utilization ratio is the difference between credit available to you versus the amount of credit you actually use. So if you've charged $500 on a card with a $1,000 limit, your utilization ratio would be 50%.
If your credit card company reduces your credit line, then your ratio changes and you end up using a larger percentage of your available credit. And that's bad news, because a lower ratio is better and anything above 30% can lead to your score taking a big hit.
Because of the risk to your credit, it's a good idea to avoid letting old cards go dormant and to make sure you don't do anything that prompts your card issuer to reduce the amount it is willing to allow you to borrow.
This isn’t your usual credit card. Our experts choose this card personally because of its higher-than-average 5% cash back rewards rate!
Plus, enjoy 0% intro APR for 15 months and you’ll earn even more with their limited-time cash back match offer!

This influences which products we write about and where and how the product appears on a page. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money.
Your credit card issuer can lower your credit limit at any time, regardless of how well you manage your account. Issuers might cut credit limits to minimize risk in an uncertain economy, as many cardholders have experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Or they may do it when cardholders regularly use what the issuers see as too much or too little of their available credit.
Credit card companies determine your credit limit by evaluating several factors, like your credit score, your income, the available credit you already have and how much of that existing credit you're using. Ultimately, though, they can increase or decrease limits whenever they want.
You use too much of your available credit: When a cardholder regularly maxes out their credit limit or carries high balances, credit card issuers may view it as a sign of financial trouble. As a result, they may cut your credit limit going forward to minimize their own risk. This is especially true if you start paying late or missing payments.
When the card is inactive or seldom-used: The company that issued your credit card makes money only if you use the card. (That money comes from transaction fees and, if you carry a balance, interest.) If you rarely use it, the issuer may be inclined to reduce your limit and, effectively, allocate that available credit to someone else who's more likely to generate income for the issuer. If you let your card sit for too long without using it at all, your issuer might close your credit card entirely, leaving you with a potentially damaged credit score and no card to use.
When the economy is uncertain: Credit card issuers have been known to reduce credit limits to minimize their risk when the economy is uncertain. Most issuers cut credit limits during the Great Recession, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve. They also did so in response to the COVID-19 economy.
Credit card companies are not required to notify you about lowering a credit limit unless it will lead to an over-the-limit fee, which is unlikely since many issuers no longer assess this fee. In most cases, credit card companies are required to notify you 45 days ahead of time about any changes to your account's terms and conditions, but this is one exception.
Though credit card issuers aren’t obligated to notify you about a credit limit decrease, it's common for them to do so. If you do receive such a notice, it might include a reason why the issuer trimmed your credit limit. You might even be able to ask to keep your current credit limit, depending on the reason for lowering it.
You might be able to avoid a credit limit reduction, but it will likely depend on your issuer and your track record on managing your credit. The best attempt at avoiding one is to contact your issuer as soon as you learn that your credit limit is changing. You have nothing to lose by asking the company to consider keeping your prior credit limit.
If you’re on the brink of maxing out your credit card or you’re using a lot of your available credit, it may be more difficult to persuade your issuer to leave your credit limit alone. Cardholders whose limits were slashed due to inactivity may have better luck.
Act fast to contact your credit card issuer as soon as you get notice, if you get any. If you wait too long, you might have to undergo a credit check to get a credit limit increase, and there’s no certainty that you’ll get bumped back up to your previous amount.
A lower credit limit can affect your credit score if it materially changes your credit utilization ratio, the percentage of your available credit you're using. Utilization is a key factor in your credit score. A rule of thumb is to use less than 30% of your available credit.
Even if a reduced limit pushes you over that percentage, the effect doesn't have to be permanent. Stay on track with payments and get your debt down, and your credit can recover.
Whether you want to pay less interest or earn more rewards, the right card's out there. Just answer a few questions and we'll narrow the search for you.

Don't Let Your Credit Limit Catch You Off Guard

The idea of your credit limit changing without your consent is enough to unnerve even the most financially savvy among us. But it's a reality you should be prepared for.

When you get a credit card, you're assigned a credit limit based on factors like your income and credit score. However, this limit isn't set in stone. Card companies can lower your limit at any time, often without warning, and it can have serious consequences for your credit score.

In general, credit card companies have broad discretion to adjust your credit line as they see fit. They might do this in response to economic turmoil, changes in their lending portfolios, or even because of your specific spending habits with the card.

But what happens when your credit card company reduces your credit line? For starters, it can significantly impact your credit utilization ratio. This ratio is the second most important factor in determining your credit score, and it's calculated by dividing the amount of credit you're using by the amount available to you. So, if you've charged $500 on a card with a $1,000 limit, your utilization ratio would be 50%.

If your credit card company reduces your credit line, your utilization ratio suddenly increases, and that's bad news. Aiming for a ratio of 30% or less is key to maintaining a healthy credit score.

To avoid this risk, it's essential to keep your credit card accounts active and avoid doing anything that might prompt your card issuer to reduce your credit limit. By being proactive and staying on top of your credit, you can avoid the negative consequences of a lowered credit limit.

**Don't Let Your Credit Limit Hold You Back**

As a credit cardholder, you're likely familiar with your credit limit - the maximum amount you're allowed to charge on your card. But did you know that this limit isn't set in stone? Card companies can adjust your credit line at any time, and it can have serious consequences for your credit score.

**Why Credit Card Companies Lower Credit Limits**

Credit card companies have broad discretion to lower your credit limit, and they may do so for a variety of reasons. These can include overall economic turmoil, changes to their lending portfolios, or even your specific spending behavior with the card. If your credit card company reduces your credit limit, it can hurt your credit score by increasing your credit utilization ratio.

**How Credit Utilization Ratio Affects Your Credit Score**

Your credit utilization ratio is the difference between the credit available to you and the amount of credit you're actually using. For example, if you've charged $500 on a card with a $1,000 limit, your utilization ratio would be 50%. A lower ratio is better, and anything above 30% can lead to a big hit to your score.

**Protect Your Credit Score**

To avoid the risks of a reduced credit limit, it's essential to keep your old cards active and avoid doing anything that might prompt your card issuer to lower your credit limit. By being mindful of your credit utilization ratio and keeping your credit score healthy, you can ensure you have access to the credit you need when you need it.

0.5,"Don't look now, but the Bitcoin (BTC 3.35%)-is-digital-gold argument is coming back. During the crypto market meltdown, nobody wanted to hear that Bitcoin was digital gold because the price of Bitcoin was tanking. But now that the worst of the crypto market sell-off appears to be behind us, and when the price of Bitcoin appears to have stabilized at about the $20,000 level, traders are once again talking about Bitcoin as a potential safe haven asset.
Adding fuel to the fire, Ethereum (ETH 2.31%) co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently suggested on a Twitter thread that ""crypto is the better bet"" compared to gold. If anything, Buterin's remarks take the argument one step further. It widens the net to include all crypto, not just Bitcoin. And it suggests that crypto is, quite possibly, a superior investment to gold during a period of market uncertainty. Does Buterin have a point?
Buterin broke down his argument into three succinct points. Two of these, quite frankly, don't seem very compelling. For example, Buterin suggested that gold doesn't support the same types of ""safe storage options"" that are available in the digital world. I don't know about you, but gold seems pretty safe to me.
Buterin also suggested that gold is ""inconvenient"" and ""difficult to use"" when doing business. This seems to be a better argument because just about anyone can agree that tapping a button on your phone to send crypto anywhere in the world is much easier than lugging around a few gold bars to make a transaction. But it doesn't mean that crypto is a better investment than gold.
The third argument, though, is the one that really got me. Buterin suggested that ""gold has less adoption"" than crypto. If you take a huge, macro view of the situation, more people own crypto than own physical gold, and that gives it a measure of safety. Some 145 million American adults say they own cryptocurrency or have invested in crypto in the past. This is 56% of the U.S. adult population.
The digital gold argument worked for as long as it did because Bitcoin seemed to be uncorrelated with any other asset class, meaning its price didn't move in the same as other investments. However, as we saw in 2022, Bitcoin is correlated, at least loosely, with the broader market. In other words, Bitcoin has the potential to go down when stocks go down. As a result, it lost some of its attraction for investors earlier this year.
But look at what's happening in the financial markets right now when it comes to volatility. Just about everyone agrees that Bitcoin is less volatile than it has been. Some traders are even calling Bitcoin ""boring"" now. If lower volatility for Bitcoin is a long-term trend, that would make it a much more attractive investment, right?
Secondly, Bitcoin is now much more correlated with gold than it has been for a long time. The correlation between Bitcoin and gold is at its highest point in 40 days. This is, admittedly, a very small sample set, but it does suggest that traders around the world are trying to figure things out, and relationships between asset classes may be shifting.
At a time when many people are nervous about tech stocks and the market in general, is it really possible that crypto could become a safe haven asset? Will people who are worried about their money and savings really trust crypto over gold?
Note that Buterin did not say that ""crypto is a better investment than gold."" What he said was that ""crypto is the better bet."" I don't think he's referring to a casino-style bet here. Instead, he's framing this in terms of game theory. Buterin came into crypto via the world of multiplayer online gaming, and in the past, he has made arguments to suggest that he views the financial markets as a similar sort of vast multiplayer game. This is a game in which cooperation is key, but communication and trust might be nonexistent. It requires a knowledge of game theory to succeed.
Based on this, I think Buterin is really suggesting something along the lines of the following: Given that it's impossible to communicate directly with market players around the world to find out what they are thinking, and given that the range of possible future outcomes is impossibly large, crypto seems to be emerging as the asset that has the highest probability of future success.
For now, gold is obviously a much safer investment than all but a handful of cryptos. But that's where things get interesting, because cryptos such as Bitcoin and Ethereum could be emerging as potential safe havens for nervous investors. Investing in crypto is always risky and volatile, but if relationships between asset classes continue to shift, it might be worth considering whether it's now time to hedge your bets with a little crypto.

The Great Recession of the 2000s was followed a decade later by the COVID-19 recession, one of the shortest in history. The reoccurrence of recessions has renewed the interest investors have in making sure they lose as little as possible if a recession hits.
As an investor, you'd traditionally hold a portion of your portfolio in precious metals like gold. This provides a hedge against the losses stocks can take during a downward economic trend. This has proven effective and still is—but a new alternative is challenging this old-school capital preservation method. Bitcoin is proving to be an interesting asset for investors because it has been around long enough to gain recognition and support—it is even showing a few trends.
Bitcoin launched in 2009—the decentralized technology ushered in a new era in finance and investing. Initially, these digital currencies were only attractive to a few niche enthusiasts. In 2010, early speculators discovered the Bitcoins they had previously purchased for fractions of a cent had grown to $0.09 per Bitcoin. Large-scale Bitcoin mining farms and pools became popular, and cryptocurrency exchanges emerged.
Investors and speculators began to use Bitcoin in a buy-and-hold strategy as its price fluctuated wildly over 2021, hoping it would maintain value as the pandemic continued.
Gold historically performs well during market corrections because it maintains its value; its price holds somewhat steady, then tends to rise as investors move from stocks to gold if a recession is threatening. This makes it useful as a hedge—an investment that moves opposite another—against market corrections or recessions.
Gold has dominated the economies and markets for thousands of years as a means of exchange and holding wealth. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and only achieved widespread recognition several years later. Other key differences can provide clues into which one you might want to include in your portfolio.
Gold’s established system for trading, weighing, and tracking is pristine. It’s very hard to steal or fake; it's also highly regulated. In many countries, you cannot cross borders while carrying gold without regulatory permission.6 When investing in gold, you'll generally only be able to purchase it from registered dealers and brokers; one caveat is that you should only buy physical gold if you can safely store it.
Bitcoin is also difficult to steal and fake, thanks to its encrypted and decentralized system. It is generally legal to use across the borders of different countries, with a few exceptions. However, the regulatory infrastructure that could exist to ensure that users are safe is not yet in place—the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency also makes it challenging to regulate.
Gold has historically been used in many applications—currency, luxury items, specialized applications in dentistry, electronics, and much more. This cross-functional utility has given gold its ability to maintain value when other asset values fall.
Bitcoin is limited in its utility. It is currently only used as a digital currency and a speculative investment. However, there is an emerging financial technology whose concept is to use cryptocurrency for financial transactions called decentralized finance. Bitcoin has utility in this emerging tech as a form of lending, borrowing, and possibly more. It also has the potential to be involved in nearly as many applications as gold—but following the same line of thought, it has just as much potential to become useless and invaluable.
One primary concern for investors looking toward Bitcoin as a haven is its liquidity. Cryptocurrencies are generally very liquid assets; however, this may not always be the case. There are times when it might be more liquid than other assets and times when it isn't.
If you're looking for an asset that you can quickly move in and out of without losing value in a short time (like Bitcoin can), gold might be a better option. It is a much more liquid asset and can allow you to reallocate your portfolio quicker when the market fluctuates.
For example, if you had several hundred Bitcoin, you might have a hard time liquidating them if you wanted to get out of cryptocurrency in a hurry—exchanges such as Coinbase only allow for $50,000 liquidation of cryptocurrency per day.7 If Bitcoin's price is higher than the daily limit allowed by your exchange, you'll only be able to do it in smaller increments. If you don't own many Bitcoins, it might be a much more liquid asset for you. Additionally, if the market swings wildly and many investors begin selling their Bitcoin, its price would drop dramatically in response.
Bitcoin has historically proven to be subject to the media effect, investor sentiment, regulatory actions, and hype. News from the digital currency sphere could prompt investors to panic and make quick decisions, quickly sending Bitcoin's price upward or downward. This volatility is not inherent to gold for the reasons mentioned above, making it perhaps a safer asset.
Whether Bitcoin is a better investment than gold boils down to your investment goals, whether you enjoy speculating, your risk tolerance, and how much capital you can stand to lose if the market turns. A financial advisor can help you create investing goals and decide whether Bitcoin is a good investment for you.
Gold is one of the more rare metals. Bitcoin is rare compared to other cryptocurrencies, and gold is rare compared to other metals. They are both rare in their respective categories.
Bitcoin is similar to gold in that it has become an alternate investment for some investors. It has the potential for many uses and can be a worthwhile investment if used in the right strategy.
Which is better depends upon your risk tolerance, investing strategy, how much capital you have to use, and how much you can tolerate losing. Bitcoin is much more volatile than gold, making it a riskier investment than gold.

**The Bitcoin-Digital Gold Argument Reignites: Is Crypto the Better Bet?**

The notion that Bitcoin (BTC) is digital gold is experiencing a resurgence. During the crypto market downturn, the argument fell out of favor, but with the market stabilizing and Bitcoin's price steadying around $20,000, traders are once again exploring its potential as a safe-haven asset.

Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently fueled the discussion with a Twitter thread positing that ""crypto is the better bet"" compared to gold. Buterin's assertion goes beyond the Bitcoin-digital gold comparison, suggesting that crypto, as a whole, may be a superior investment during periods of market uncertainty.

Buterin's argument is built upon three key points. While two of these points may not be particularly compelling, his third point – that ""gold has less adoption"" than crypto – holds significant weight. With over 145 million American adults owning or having invested in cryptocurrency, crypto's broader adoption confers a degree of safety.

The digital gold narrative initially gained traction due to Bitcoin's apparent lack of correlation with other asset classes. However, as seen in 2022, Bitcoin's price can indeed move in tandem with the broader market, diminishing its appeal to investors. Nevertheless, the current reduction in volatility is rendering Bitcoin a more attractive investment.

Furthermore, Bitcoin's correlation with gold is at its highest point in 40 days, indicating that traders are reassessing relationships between asset classes. As investors grow increasingly cautious about tech stocks and the market, the question arises: could crypto emerge as a safe-haven asset?

It is essential to note that Buterin's statement is not equivalent to saying that ""crypto is a better investment than gold."" Rather, he is suggesting that, in a game-theoretic framework, crypto appears to have a higher probability of future success.

While gold is undoubtedly a safer investment than most cryptos, the shifting landscape of asset classes may be paving the way for cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum to become potential safe havens. As the crypto market continues to evolve, it may be prudent to consider hedging bets with a diversified investment portfolio.

The Bitcoin-as-Digital-Gold Argument Revived: Can Crypto Become a Safe Haven Asset?

As the cryptocurrency market begins to stabilize, the notion that Bitcoin (BTC) can be considered digital gold is gaining traction once again. During the recent market downturn, this idea was met with skepticism, but with the price of Bitcoin hovering around the $20,000 mark, traders are revisiting the concept. Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently sparked debate by suggesting that ""crypto is the better bet"" compared to gold. Buterin's remarks take the argument a step further, implying that crypto, not just Bitcoin, may be a superior investment to gold in times of market uncertainty.

Breaking Down Buterin's Argument

Buterin presents three key points to support his claim. While two of these points may not be particularly compelling, the third argument warrants closer examination. Buterin suggests that gold lacks the same safe storage options available in the digital world, which may not be a convincing argument for many. He also posits that gold is inconvenient and difficult to use in business transactions, which, although true, doesn't necessarily make crypto a better investment.

However, his third point – that gold has less adoption than crypto – is a more intriguing argument. From a macro perspective, more people own crypto than physical gold, which could contribute to its safety. In the United States alone, approximately 145 million adults own cryptocurrency or have invested in it, accounting for 56% of the U.S. adult population.

The Digital Gold Argument Revisited

The digital gold argument initially gained traction because Bitcoin seemed to be uncorrelated with other asset classes, meaning its price didn't move in tandem with other investments. However, as seen in 2022, Bitcoin does exhibit some correlation with the broader market, which makes it less appealing to investors seeking a safe-haven asset. Nevertheless, with the current decrease in volatility, Bitcoin is becoming more attractive.

Furthermore, the correlation between Bitcoin and gold is at an all-time high, indicating that traders are reevaluating their asset allocation strategies. As market uncertainty persists, is it possible that crypto could emerge as a safe-haven asset, and will investors trust crypto over gold?

Reframing Buterin's Argument

Buterin's statement ""crypto is the better bet"" should not be interpreted as a casual wager. Rather, he is framing this argument in terms of game theory, suggesting that crypto has a higher probability of future success given the complexities of the financial markets. In essence, Buterin is proposing that crypto may be the better choice for investors seeking a safe-haven asset.

Investing in crypto is inherently risky and volatile, but if relationships between asset classes continue to shift, it may be worth considering hedging your bets with a small allocation to crypto. For now, gold remains a safer investment than most cryptos, but the landscape is rapidly changing.

0.5,"Chase Freedom and Chase Freedom Flex cardholders can now activate their 5% bonus rewards categories for the fourth quarter of 2021. After activation, they will receive 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in combined spending on purchases made through PayPal and at Walmart, including Walmart.com.
As long as you activate by that date, you'll earn 5% cash back on the eligible categories for the entire quarter, including purchases you made before you activated the promotion.
To maximize your rewards, add your Chase Freedom or Freedom Flex card to your PayPal account. Then, when you're shopping online, look for opportunities to check out with PayPal instead of paying directly with your card. The good news is that millions of online retailers accept PayPal as a payment method.
You may also consider shopping at Walmart or Walmart.com to do your holiday shopping. If you have an authorized user on your account, coordinate with them so that they also adapt to the new bonus categories with their spending. You can track how much you've earned in bonus rewards in your online account.

The Chase Freedom Flex℠ is adding to its already impressive arsenal of bonus categories as the holiday spending season is upon us.
Grocery stores (not including Target and Walmart purchases).
This means that through Dec. 31, 2021, in addition to earning 5% cash back for Walmart and PayPal purchases (on up to $1,500 in combined quarterly spending), eligible cardholders will be able to earn an additional 5% back up to a separate spending cap of $1,500. All in all, if you maxed out both spending caps, you could make out with a lucrative $150 in cash back from rotating and top-spend bonus categories alone this quarter.
Chase cardholders must activate bonus categories online or in the Chase app by Dec. 14 to be eligible for bonus cash back, which can be earned retroactively.
If your top-spend bonus category is the same as one of the card’s fixed bonus categories, you’ll earn both bonuses. For example, if your top earn category is dining, you’d be able to earn a total of 7% cash back when you make eligible dining purchases — (4% from the top-spend category + 2% back from the fixed dining category + 1% base earn, which can only be earned once per purchase).
And the same goes for purchases made through PayPal, a Q4 bonus category. You’ll earn a total of 9% cash back when you make purchases in your top spend category through the payment service.
Fitness clubs and gym memberships.
Gas stations and electric vehicle charging.
This offer adds a great deal of value to the $0-annual-fee Chase Freedom Flex℠, but it also makes the already potentially complicated card even more difficult to manage.
To get the most out of rewards this quarter, cardholders will have to keep track of their rotating bonus category spending and their top-spend category, in addition to monitoring the card’s regular fixed bonus categories.
Although this is the first time Chase has offered cardholders the ability to earn cash back in their top spending categories, there are other cards that offer a similar rewards structure. For example, the $0-annual-fee Citi Custom Cash® Card — which began accepting applicants in June 2021 — features similarly customizable bonus cash back from a list of eligible category options. It earns 5% cash back in cardholders’ top eligible spending category, on up to $500 each billing cycle (1% back after that).
1.5%-6.5%Enjoy 6.5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards®; 4.5% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery service, and 3% on all other purchases (on up to $20,000 spent in the first year). After your first year or $20,000 spent, enjoy 5% cash back on Chase travel purchased through Ultimate Rewards®, 3% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery service, and unlimited 1.5% cash back on all other purchases.
$300Earn an additional 1.5% cash back on everything you buy (on up to $20,000 spent in the first year) - worth up to $300 cash back!

60,000Earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. That's $750 toward travel when you redeem through Chase Ultimate Rewards®.

0.5,"Investing and trading are two different methods of attempting to profit in the financial markets. Both investors and traders seek profits through market participation. Investors generally seek larger returns over an extended period through buying and holding. Traders, by contrast, take advantage of both rising and falling markets to enter and exit positions over a shorter time frame, taking smaller, more frequent profits.
The goal of investing is to gradually build wealth over an extended period of time. This is done by buying and holding a portfolio of one or more asset classes. This can include stocks, baskets of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other investment instruments.
Investments are often held for a period of years or even decades, taking advantage of perks like interest, dividends, and stock splits along the way. While markets inevitably fluctuate, investors typically ride out the downtrends with the expectation that prices will rebound and any losses eventually will be recovered. Investors are generally more concerned with market fundamentals, such as price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios and management forecasts.
Anyone with a 401(k) or an individual retirement account (IRA) is investing, even if they don't track the performance of their holdings on a daily basis. Since the goal is to grow a retirement account over decades, the day-to-day fluctuations of different mutual funds are less important than consistent growth over an extended period.
Investors generally follow a long-term investment time horizon to achieve their goals. This is usually more than one year as evidenced by the buy-and-hold strategy. The total length of time that an investor takes before they get their money back depends largely on their investment style or strategy and their goals. This means that someone saving for retirement has a longer time horizon than someone who is saving money to put a down payment on a house.
Investors often enhance their profits by compounding or reinvesting any profits and dividends into additional shares of stock.
Trading involves more frequent transactions, such as the buying and selling of stocks, commodities, currency pairs, or other instruments. The goal is to generate returns that outperform buy-and-hold investing. While investors may be content with annual returns of 10% to 15%, traders might seek a 10% return each month.
Trading profits are generated by buying at a lower price and selling at a higher price within a relatively short period of time. The reverse also is true: trading profits can be made by selling at a higher price and buying to cover at a lower price (known as selling short) to profit in falling markets.
While buy-and-hold investors wait out less profitable positions, traders seek to make profits within a specified period of time and often use a protective stop-loss order to close out losing positions at a predetermined price level automatically. Traders often employ technical analysis tools, such as moving averages and stochastic oscillators, to find high-probability trading setups.
Traders often choose their trading style based on account size, amount of time dedicated to trading, level of trading experience, personality, and risk tolerance.
Unlike investors, traders have a short-term time horizon in mind while executing their trades. That's because traders monitor the markets consistently for changes in asset prices before making their moves. The goal is to take advantage of these ups and downs to maximize profits and minimize losses. A trader's time horizon can be anywhere from a few minutes to several days.
The goal for investing and trading is the same: to make money. Both investors and traders do this by opening accounts so they can easily buy and sell assets like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds among others.
Both investing and trading come with the possibility of risk and reward. After all, there are no guarantees in life, including the markets. Although the degree varies, every asset comes with the potential for loss the same way they promise big gains.
The length of time that an investor and trader hold their assets diverges. As noted above, investors normally have a longer time horizon in mind. This is typically more than a year. Traders, on the other hand, normally hold onto their assets for short time frames. This can be as little as a few minutes.
The potential for loss is among the key differences between the two. There is a risk of losing your money regardless of whether you hold it for the long term or for a short period of time. But the risk increases for traders for several reasons. They tend to hold onto their assets for a shorter time frame and they are also more open to holding a diverse set of assets—those that investors may not necessarily keep in their portfolios. This includes futures and swaps.
Unlike investing, trading requires a great deal of time, effort, understanding of the markets, and research. Many traders are experienced and have a greater sense of how the markets work. While investors may also be experienced, a great many aren't. As such, they may rely on the expertise of financial experts, such as financial advisors.
Although these terms are generally used interchangeably, trading and investing are not the same thing. Trading involves buying and selling assets (such as stocks) for short-term gains. Traders primarily focus on share prices as they make their decisions. Investors, on the other hand, focus on long-term gains when they buy and sell investment vehicles.
There's no easy answer to this question. That's because it depends on you and your financial situation. Trading is well-suited to individuals who have a good grasp of the markets and how they work. Traders are also more risk-tolerant, so they won't get distracted when there are some dips in the market or if they end up taking a loss. People who are more risk-averse and want to preserve their capital do better with investing.
Trading is generally more complex than investing. That's because trading requires consistent monitoring of the markets and a better understanding of how assets and markets work. Traders tend to buy and sell assets on a consistent and regular basis, and these assets can be as simple as stocks and bonds. But they can also be more complex like futures contracts and swaps. Unlike many investors, traders have to be able to keep their emotions at bay. This can be somewhat difficult as big losses can be harder to swallow.
People often confuse investing and trading, using the terms interchangeably. But it's easy to see why because there are some distinct similarities, such as the need to open accounts, deposit money, and buy and sell assets. But the two are very different. Investors have a much longer time horizon than traders and are usually more risk-averse. Traders usually have a better understanding of how different assets and markets work. Whether you're an investor or trader, you should be aware of the rewards as well as the risks involved.

The biggest difference between stock trading and investing is the investment timeframe. Traders invest for the short-term, whereas investors hold onto assets for the long-term. In reality, trading, or day trading, is a style of investing.
The focus of traders and investors is also different. Traders often focus on a stock’s technical factors rather than a company’s long-term prospects. What matters to traders is which direction the stock will move next and how the trader can profit from that move.
Investors study a company’s potential for long-term growth or value, then buy and hold, but traders often take advantage of small mispricings in the market, such as when political uncertainty in a foreign country temporarily pushes down the share price of a U.S. manufacturer.

Create an investment plan for buying, selling and rebalancing your holdings. For example, some people sell some holdings and buy others to get the portfolio back in line with original goals after market moves have pushed it out of whack.
Consider index funds, which don't try to beat the market, but mirror the performance of a market index, such as the Nasdaq or the Standard & Poor’s 500.
Know your investing strategy. That includes knowing what your goals are (retirement, college tuition, etc.) and how much risk you can tolerate.

Investing vs. Trading: What's the Difference?

When it comes to making money in the financial markets, there are two distinct approaches: investing and trading. While both methods aim to generate profits, they differ significantly in their strategies, time horizons, and risk tolerance.

Investing: A Long-Term Game

Investing is a buy-and-hold strategy that seeks to build wealth over an extended period. It involves purchasing a portfolio of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, and holding onto them for years or even decades. The goal is to ride out market fluctuations and reap the benefits of compound interest, dividends, and stock splits.

Investors typically have a long-term time horizon, often more than a year, and focus on market fundamentals, such as price-to-earnings ratios and management forecasts. They're not concerned with daily market volatility, as they're in it for the long haul.

Trading: A Short-Term Play

Trading, on the other hand, is a short-term strategy that aims to generate returns through frequent buying and selling of assets, such as stocks, commodities, or currency pairs. Traders seek to profit from market movements, often using technical analysis tools, like moving averages and stochastic oscillators, to identify high-probability trading setups.

Traders have a short-term time horizon, often ranging from minutes to days, and are more concerned with market trends and technical indicators than fundamental analysis. They're constantly monitoring the markets, looking for opportunities to buy or sell assets at the right price.

Key Differences Between Investing and Trading

While both investing and trading carry risks, the key differences lie in their time horizons, risk tolerance, and strategies. Investors tend to be more risk-averse, focusing on long-term growth, whereas traders are more aggressive, seeking short-term gains.

Traders often employ a protective stop-loss order to limit their losses, whereas investors are more likely to ride out market downturns. Additionally, traders typically have a better understanding of market mechanics and are more comfortable with frequent buying and selling.

Which Approach is Right for You?

Ultimately, the choice between investing and trading depends on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals. If you're risk-averse and seek long-term growth, investing might be the better option. However, if you're comfortable with market volatility and seek short-term gains, trading could be the way to go.

It's essential to understand that both approaches carry risks, and it's crucial to educate yourself on the markets and develop a solid strategy before diving in.

Investing vs. Trading: What's the Difference?

Many people use the terms ""investing"" and ""trading"" interchangeably, but they're not exactly the same thing. Both involve buying and selling assets, but the goals, strategies, and timeframes are different.

Investing is a long-term game. It involves buying and holding a portfolio of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, with the goal of growing wealth over time. Investors typically focus on the underlying fundamentals of the companies they invest in, such as earnings growth, management team, and competitive advantage.

Trading, on the other hand, is a shorter-term approach. It involves buying and selling assets frequently, with the goal of generating returns in a shorter timeframe. Traders often focus on technical analysis, such as charts and patterns, to make their decisions.

One key difference between investing and trading is the time horizon. Investors often hold onto their assets for years or even decades, while traders typically hold onto their assets for shorter periods, such as days, weeks, or months.

Another difference is the level of risk involved. Trading typically involves more risk, as traders are more likely to experience losses if they make wrong decisions. Investors, on the other hand, can ride out market fluctuations and avoid making emotional decisions.

So, which approach is right for you? It depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment style. If you're looking for long-term growth and are willing to take a more hands-off approach, investing might be the way to go. But if you're looking for shorter-term returns and are willing to take on more risk, trading might be more suitable.

Ultimately, the key is to understand your goals and risk tolerance, and to develop a strategy that aligns with those factors. Whether you're investing or trading, it's essential to educate yourself, set a budget, and diversify your portfolio to minimize risk.

0.494791666666667,"It's imperative that you're financially prepared for retirement. Living on Social Security alone is difficult, so you'll want an additional source of income. For most people, that extra money must come from retirement savings.
A 401(k) is a popular retirement investment account used by millions of U.S. workers, in large part because this account offers generous tax advantages. Because it's administered by employers, it's convenient to invest in.
If you have access to a workplace 401(k), saving in it early and aggressively could provide a path to a secure retirement. But how have Americans done with investing in their 401(k) accounts? Check out the average 401(k) balance by age and income level to see where you stack up when it comes to your retirement savings.
Each year, Vanguard collects data from approximately 5 million retirement accounts. Based on its analysis in 2023, the average 401(k) balance was $112,572 in 2022, down about 20% from 2021. The drop was largely due to declines in the stock and bond markets through the end of 2022. However, averages varied substantially by age. The table below shows the average and median balances for individuals in different age groups.
Many financial experts recommend that your savings at age 30 equal at least one year of your salary. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports the average salary for full-time workers ages 25 to 34 was $56,160 in the fourth quarter of 2023. That means many 30-year-olds in the U.S. have an average balance that falls short of the recommended amount.
You should aim to have at least three times your annual salary saved for retirement by age 40. Workers ages 35 to 44 have an average salary of $67,756, according to the BLS. A worker earning the average salary would want to have just over $200,000 saved. Again the average and median 401(k) balances fall short.
By the time you hit 50, you should have six times your salary invested for your later years. The BLS reports the average salary for workers ages 45 to 54 is $66,300. This would mean a typical worker should have savings of nearly $400,000.
Finally, by age 60, you should have eight times your final salary, and, by age 67 (full retirement age for many in the U.S.), you should have 10 times your final salary. By this point, workers are getting very close to retirement and should ideally have a substantial nest egg.
The earlier you start investing in your 401(k), the easier it is to build a hefty balance thanks to compound earnings.
When you invest money, your investments earn money for you. This can be reinvested so you then have a larger pool of assets earning returns. Your money can grow exponentially. That's why Albert Einstein was famously quoted as describing compound interest as the ""eighth wonder of the world.""
The chart below shows how much $1,000 invested in your 401(k) could turn into by age 67, depending on when you make your $1,000 investment and assuming an 8% average annual rate of return.
While it may be a challenge to save when you're young, it pays to do so.
If you're using the wrong credit or debit card, it could be costing you serious money. Our experts love this top pick, which features a 0% intro APR for 15 months, an insane cash back rate of up to 5%, and all somehow for no annual fee. In fact, this card is so good that our experts use it personally. Click here to read our full review for free and apply in just 2 minutes.
Not surprisingly, income impacts the amount workers invest in their 401(k). The table below shows the average account balance based on income level.
Higher earners need more money saved for retirement because, in most cases, they are used to a higher standard of living. They will need their retirement investment accounts to produce sufficient funds to maintain their lifestyle after their paychecks stop.
Many workers contribute a set percentage of income to their 401(k), such as 10%. With this percentage-based approach, higher earners inevitably invest more for retirement each year than their lower-earning counterparts.
Gender can also impact 401(k) balances. In particular, men have much higher average balances than their female peers.
This is explained by many factors, including the gender wage gap (men tend to earn more than women) and the fact that women may have fewer years on the job because they are more likely to take time off due to caregiving responsibilities.
The table below shows the average and median 401(k) balances by gender.
Unfortunately, women often face an uphill battle in investing enough for a secure future -- especially since they tend to live longer than men and need larger balances as a result.
Many U.S. workers retire by the time they reach 65. Vanguard's data shows the average 401(k) balance for workers 65 and older to be $232,710, while the median balance is $70,620.
For retirees following the 4% rule, the average balance would produce just $9,300 in annual retirement income, while the median would provide only around $2,800. Even when combined with Social Security, this may not be sufficient to provide a comfortable income in retirement.
A 401(k) can be a convenient and simple way to save for retirement, although you have other options, including traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.
You should be investing in these retirement plans throughout your career with the goal of amassing a nest egg large enough to meet your needs. If you aren't hitting your investment targets, consider carefully reviewing your budget to find more opportunities to save. As you earn salary increases, you may also want to save those raises in your 401(k) rather than spending the extra income since this can make it easier to hit your savings targets.
By automating contributions to a 401(k) and aiming to save 15% or more of your income for retirement throughout your career, you could end up with a 401(k) balance well above the average or median for workers in the U.S. Hopefully, you'll have a more secure retirement for doing so.
So can you have both? Yes, with some limitations.

The average 401(k) balance at Vanguard was $112,572 in 2022.
Your age, income and job tenure may affect the size of your 401(k) balance is.
Balances fell overall in 2022 because of market volatility.
Taking advantage of an employer match may help you beef up your balance.
Every year, 401(k) holders at Vanguard hit millionaire status. Not one of them? You’re not alone: A seven-figure 401(k) balance is the exception, not the rule.
If that balance still seems high, consider that averages tend to be skewed by outliers, and in this case, that number is being propped up by those rare millionaires. The median, which represents the middle balance between the highs and lows, was $27,376 in 2022.
No matter which number is closer to your reality — and for some, both might feel out of reach — it’s important to remember that numbers like this might tempt you to gawk, but they probably won’t offer you much actionable information.
According to Vanguard's 2022 data, here is the average 401(k) balance by age.
While averages may be more common, the median is often a better metric for getting an accurate view of a data set. Averages are influenced by outliers — either very high or very low numbers. You'll notice that Vanguard's average 401(k) balances are quite a bit higher than the medians.
How much are you putting into your 401(k)? The IRS sets contribution limits for 401(k) accounts, or the maximum amount you can add to your account in a given year. Those contribution limits are $23,000 in 2024 ($30,500 for those age 50 or older).
Most people don't contribute the max – only 15% of Vanguard plan participants did in 2022 – and most of those investors were older, made more money, and had been with their employer for longer compared with those who contribute less.
Even if you made the maximum contribution every single year and posted double-digit investment returns — both of which are highly unlikely — it would take nearly 20 years to hit a million. That makes it unfair and fruitless for, say, a 25-year-old to compare their 401(k) balance with the average for savers of all ages.
If you want to beef up your balance without maxing out your 401(k), one way to do it is to contribute at least enough to get the employer match if there's one offered. About half, 49%, of Vanguard's plans had an employer match.
To get their employer 401(k) match, employees had to first put in an average of 6.8% of pay; the median required contribution to get a match was 6%, which means half of plans required more than that, and half required less.
Many of the participants in this age group are new to working and new to saving for retirement. Yet even at this age, it’s a good rule of thumb to prioritize contributing to your workplace retirement plan, especially if your employer matches a portion of your contributions.
These numbers don’t reflect what younger investors may have saved elsewhere, in taxable brokerage accounts, or individual retirement accounts, such as Roth or traditional IRAs.
At this point, whether measured by the average or the median, participants have increased their balances quite a bit.
As people age and spend more time in the workforce, they’re more likely to hold more than one 401(k), especially if they’ve changed jobs without rolling over or combining accounts.
This group has hit the age at which catch-up contributions are allowed by the IRS: Participants age 50 and older can contribute an extra $7,500 in 2023, and $8,000 in 2024.[3]IRS. Retirement Topics - Catch-Up Contributions.View all sources That can be helpful for those feeling behind at this point, assuming that extra cash is available to put toward retirement.
Growth has slowed here, which makes sense, as people may start to withdraw the money they've been saving for retirement.
After this age group, 401(k) balances can begin to fall, or at least grow at a slower pace, as even more people start tapping their accounts. The average balance for those 65 and older is $232,710; the median falls to $70,620.
Again: not much. This is a fairly arbitrary benchmark. In the aggregate, it can speak to how workers in general are doing when it comes to saving for retirement, but it does little to help you analyze your own situation. It’s also limited to people who have a defined contribution plan at work; many workers don’t.
Finally, it’s worth noting that you may or may not want to put all your retirement eggs into a 401(k) basket. Should you max out your 401(k)? Maybe. But it isn't the best choice for everyone.

The importance of retirement savings cannot be overstated. Living solely on Social Security can be a challenge, which is why it's crucial to have an additional source of income. For most people, this means relying on their retirement savings.

A 401(k) is a popular retirement investment account used by millions of U.S. workers, largely due to its generous tax advantages and convenience, as it's administered by employers. If you have access to a workplace 401(k), investing in it early and aggressively could lead to a secure retirement. But how do Americans fare when it comes to investing in their 401(k) accounts?

0.481481481481481,"A stock is ex-dividend when a new owner is not entitled to the next dividend payment — The stock is being purchased excluding a pending dividend distribution, and its price may be slightly lower because of that.
A stock is ex-dividend if it is purchased on or after the ex-dividend date (or sometimes called the ex-date). While ex-dividend, the purchaser of a company’s stock will not receive a pending dividend payment. This period is necessary because a company must know to whom to pay the dividend. To determine who qualifies, the company figuratively circles a day on the calendar. Anyone owning shares on that day (called the record date) will receive the payment. Because it takes a few days to update ownership records, any trades happening the last few days before the date of record are ex-dividend (the previous owner gets the upcoming dividend).
The General Motors Company (GM) declared a dividend payment to shareholders of $0.38 per share of common stock. The announcement was made on October 28, telling traders that the dividend will be paid on December 19. The company also noted that the shareholder of record on December 6 would be entitled to the dividend payment. Because it takes time to update the books, purchases too close to the record date won’t be transferred in time to qualify for the distribution. Therefore, stock purchases after December 4 were ex-dividend (December 5 was the ex-date).
There are only so many seats. Everyone behind a certain point will have to wait for the next trip (the next dividend). If you counted the people in front of you and the number of seats, you could determine that cut-off point. Then, you could tell the people waiting in line if they would be getting on the current ride or if they will have to wait for the next one. Missing the next trip (dividend) is a slightly worse deal; a stock’s price may temporarily reflect that.

Stock rewards not claimed within 60 days may expire. See full terms and conditions at rbnhd.co/freestock. Securities trading is offered through Robinhood Financial LLC.
While a stock is ex-dividend, it is traded knowing that a pending dividend payment is not included in the sale. The owner of the stock on the day before the ex-dividend date will receive the distribution regardless of whether or not they still own the stock when it is paid.
Because the value of the dividend distribution doesn’t get transferred while it is ex-dividend, the price of the stock will often drop by the dividend amount on the day it goes ex-dividend. This reduction in the stock’s price should not be confused with an indication that the value of the company has changed and should be considered when comparing value metrics such as the price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio).
The declaration date is the day the company announces a dividend distribution via a press release. The company’s board of directors will have decided to pay a dividend days or weeks earlier. But the declaration date is the first day the public is made aware of the upcoming distribution.
The payment date is the day that the dividend will be distributed to shareholders. This date is provided on the declaration date, so traders know when to expect the payment to reach their accounts.
The record date is the day the company closes its books on who is entitled to the pending dividend. Anyone owning shares on this date receives the payment on each share indicated by the company records.
The ex-dividend date (sometimes called the ex-date) is the first trading day for which any stock trades no longer include the pending dividend. Anyone purchasing the stock on or after the ex-date will not receive the upcoming payment.
You do not get a dividend on the ex-dividend date. When a company announces a dividend distribution, they provide two important dates. The payment date is the day you get the dividend. But the company also gives a record date that is a week or two before the payment date. Only the shareholders of record in the company books on the record date will get the dividend.
The ex-dividend date is at least one business day before the record date, which gives the company time to update its records.
Yes — Any sale that occurs on the ex-dividend date or later will exclude the pending dividend. You will still be the owner of record in the company books when they distribute the payment. So, if you sell a stock on the ex-dividend date, you will still get the dividend about two weeks later.
Say you own 100 shares of common stock in the fictional XYZ company, which is trading at $50 a share. The company announces a dividend of $0.50 per share with a payment date of March 15th. They also tell you that the ex-date is March 1st. If you sell your shares before March 1st, you will get $5,000 for the sale, but the new owner will get the dividend on March 15th. However, if you sell the shares on March 1st (or any day after that), you will likely get less value for the stock (maybe $4,950), but will still get a $50 dividend check on March 15th.
If you sell your stock even one day before the ex-dividend date, you are also selling the right to the pending dividend to the new owner.
Common stock does not have any type of vesting period. The person listed as a shareholder on the record date (the day the company checks its record of ownership) gets the dividend. Logistically this means you have to own the stock for two weeks or so before the payment date. But that is just because of the timing involved in distributing the money to the shareholders.
The record date is typically two weeks before the payment date. And because the transaction must clear before the record date, you usually have to initiate the purchase at least a few days before the record date.
Each company will provide different dates for when it will pay a dividend (the payment date) and when the record of ownership will be locked (the record date). Some companies also provide the day that transactions become ex-dividend (the new owner is not entitled to the dividend).
The record date is usually about two weeks before the payment date, and the ex-dividend date is typically one or two business days before the record date (depending on exchange rules).
Most companies tend to distribute dividends quarterly. They are usually declared after a quarterly board meeting and get distributed about 4-6 weeks later. While every company is different, you can approximate the next dividend payment by adding three months to the last one.
But remember that not all companies distribute earnings to stockholders. Companies that are growing are less likely to pay a dividend, as their profits are reinvested into the company. Companies that are well established are more likely to distribute earnings to shareholders. Also, a company that has a history of paying dividends is more likely to continue doing so.
Under normal circumstances, a dividend stock always goes ex-dividend (the purchase of the stock excludes a pending dividend payment) at least one business day before the record date (the day the company determines who will receive the distribution).
However, because a company’s stock price will usually drop by the amount of the dividend as soon as it goes ex-dividend, large distributions can cause problems on the stock market. For this reason, most stock exchange rules include an exception whenever a dividend amount is 25% or more of the stock price. In those circumstances, the stock is cum dividend (includes the dividend) up until it is paid.
In other situations, a company might provide a dividend of additional shares of the company stock rather than a cash dividend. In this case, it does not make much sense to distribute shares to someone that just expressed a desire to stop investing in the company. So, stock dividends don’t usually go ex-dividend until the shares are distributed. That means that if you sell a stock after the declaration of a stock dividend, you are selling your current shares plus the shares you are scheduled to receive.

The ex-dividend date is the day at which the stock begins trading without the subsequent dividend's value priced in since shareholders will no longer be entitled to the upcoming dividend payment.
Thus, the ex-dividend date is the date that the company has designated as the first day of trading in which the shares trade without the right to the dividend. If you sell your shares on or after this date, you will, however, still receive the dividend. If you sell your shares before the ex-date, however, you would not be entitled to receive those dividends.
If a shareholder is to receive a dividend, they need to be listed on the company's records on the date of record. This date is used to determine the company's holders of record and to authorize those to whom proxy statements, financial reports, and other pertinent information are sent.
When you purchase shares, your name does not automatically get added to the record book—this takes about two or three days from the transaction date. Therefore, if the date of the record is Aug. 10, you must have purchased the shares on Aug. 7 to receive a dividend. This would make Aug. 8 the ex-dividend date, as it is the date directly following the last date on which you could get a dividend.
The ex-dividend date is set by either the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) or the stock exchange, once the date of record has been set.1 It is typically 2 days prior since stock trades settle T+2.
Remember that a company's shares will trade for less than the dividend amount on the ex-dividend date than they did the day before.
Generally, when a dividend-paying company distributes a large dividend, the market may account for that dividend in the days preceding the ex-date due to buyers stepping in and purchasing the stock. These buyers are willing to pay a premium to receive the dividend.
Dividends that are reinvested are still taxed as dividend income.
For example, imagine shares in Apple, Inc. (AAPL) are trading at $157.50 and the company announces a quarterly dividend of $0.22. Investors who hold the shares past the ex-dividend date will receive the $0.22; investors who sell before the ex-date will not. But all is not lost: shares in the company will typically fall by roughly the amount of the dividend, to $157.28, all else equal, or there will be an arbitrage opportunity in the market.
If shares didn't fall as a result of dividend payments, everyone would simply buy the shares for $157.50, get the dividend, and then sell their shares after the ex-dividend date, essentially getting 22 cents per share free from the company.
Yes. Even if you choose to reinvest dividends instead of taking them as cash, the IRS still treats this as a taxable event.
Yes. Dividends are treated as income by the IRS. Therefore, if you take dividend income to reinvest in shares, you will have to pay taxes on the dividend income and then again on any capital gains earned when the shares are sold.
When a dividend is declared by a company, they will also specify a date of record, where shareholders that are recorded on that record date will receive the dividend. Because shares settle T+2. the ex-dividend date falls two trading days before the record date (see the Figure above). As a result, if you own the stock before the ex-dividend date and you will receive the dividend; but if you buy it on or after the ex-date, you will not.

Understanding Ex-Dividend Dates and Their Impact on Stock Prices

When a company declares a dividend payment, it sets a specific date by which investors must own the stock to receive the payment. This date is known as the record date. However, there's a catch. The company needs time to update its records, so it sets an ex-dividend date, which is typically one business day before the record date.

What does this mean for investors? If you buy a stock on or after the ex-dividend date, you won't be entitled to the upcoming dividend payment. The stock is said to be ""ex-dividend"" or ""ex-date,"" indicating that the next dividend payment is excluded from the sale.

To illustrate, let's consider an example. Imagine General Motors Company (GM) declares a dividend payment of $0.38 per share of common stock, with a payment date of December 19. The company also sets a record date of December 6, which means that shareholders listed on the company's records on that date will receive the dividend payment. Since it takes time to update the records, the ex-dividend date is set for December 4. If you buy GM stock on or after December 4, you won't receive the upcoming dividend payment.

When a stock goes ex-dividend, its price typically drops by the amount of the dividend payment. This is because the value of the dividend is no longer included in the stock price. However, this drop in price doesn't necessarily mean that the company's value has changed. Investors should be aware of this when comparing value metrics such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.

Declarations, Record Dates, and Payment Dates: What's the Difference?

When a company announces a dividend distribution, it provides three important dates:

1. Declaration date: This is the day the company announces its intention to pay a dividend.
2. Record date: This is the day the company determines who is eligible to receive the dividend payment.
3. Payment date: This is the day the dividend is actually paid to shareholders.

Understanding these dates is crucial for investors looking to receive dividend payments.

How Ex-Dividend Dates Affect Your Investment Decisions

When buying or selling a stock, it's essential to consider the ex-dividend date. If you sell a stock before the ex-dividend date, you'll still receive the upcoming dividend payment. However, if you sell after the ex-dividend date, you'll miss out on the dividend.

For example, let's say you own 100 shares of XYZ company, which is trading at $50 per share. The company announces a dividend of $0.50 per share, with a payment date of March 15. If you sell your shares before the ex-dividend date, you'll receive the dividend payment. However, if you sell on or after the ex-dividend date, you won't receive the dividend.

It's also important to note that some companies distribute dividends quarterly, while others may pay dividends annually. Understanding a company's dividend payment schedule can help you make informed investment decisions.

Key Takeaways:

* The ex-dividend date is the first trading day on which the stock no longer includes the upcoming dividend payment.
* Buying a stock on or after the ex-dividend date means you won't receive the upcoming dividend payment.
* The stock price typically drops by the amount of the dividend payment when it goes ex-dividend.
* Understanding the declaration date, record date, and payment date is crucial for investors looking to receive dividend payments.

Remember, investing in the stock market involves risk, and it's essential to do your research and consider all the factors that may affect your investment decisions.","Here is the rewritten source document in the style of Investopedia:

**Stocks and Dividend Payments: A Guide to Ex-Dividend Dates**

When a company declares a dividend payment, it sets a record date to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date, also known as the ex-date, is the first trading day after the record date, and it is the day when the stock trades without the right to receive the pending dividend payment.

**Understanding Ex-Dividend Dates and Record Dates**

The record date is the cut-off date for determining which shareholders are eligible to receive the dividend payment. To be eligible, shareholders must own the stock on or before the record date. The ex-dividend date is typically one business day before the record date, and it is the day when the stock trades without the right to receive the pending dividend payment.

**How Ex-Dividend Dates Affect Stock Prices**

When a stock goes ex-dividend, its price may drop by the amount of the dividend, as the dividend payment is no longer included in the stock's price. This is because the dividend payment is no longer accruing to the benefit of the current shareholders.

**Example of an Ex-Dividend Date**

Suppose General Motors Company (GM) declares a dividend payment of $0.38 per share of common stock, with a payment date of December 19. The company sets a record date of December 6, and the ex-dividend date is December 5. If you buy the stock on or after December 5, you will not receive the dividend payment. However, if you sell the stock on or before December 5, you will still receive the dividend payment.

**Types of Dividend Payments**

There are two types of dividend payments: cash dividends and stock dividends. Cash dividends are paid out in cash, while stock dividends are paid out in additional shares of the company's stock. Stock dividends do not typically go ex-dividend until the shares are distributed.

**Important Dates to Keep in Mind**

In addition to the record date and ex-dividend date, there are two other important dates to keep in mind: the declaration date and the payment date. The declaration date is the day the company announces the dividend payment, and the payment date is the day the dividend is paid out to shareholders.

**Key Takeaways**

In conclusion, understanding ex-dividend dates and record dates is crucial for investors who want to receive dividend payments. By knowing the ex-dividend date, investors can make informed decisions about buying or selling a stock and ensure they receive the dividend payment they are entitled to.

0.476923076923077,"Shopping for life insurance raises a number of questions. For example, what is a modified endowment contract? By the time you've finished this article, you should know what a modified endowment contract (MEC) is, how it comes to be, and whether you want to embrace or avoid an MEC.
A modified endowment contract still carries a death benefit, but unlike most permanent life insurance policies, there are few tax breaks associated with the cash that accrues.
To better explain a modified endowment contract, let's go back to decades ago, when permanent life policies, such as whole life insurance policies, were all the rage. Term life insurance is in effect for a set number of years, but whole life insurance provides coverage throughout a person's life, as long as they pay their premiums as agreed. What really set whole life apart was that it was cash value life insurance. Part of each premium goes toward cash value that the policyholder could withdraw or borrow against.
Better yet, the cash paid into whole life policies earned a guaranteed rate of interest -- and a slew of tax advantages that made them safe havens. Keenly interested in investments that minimize taxes, policyholders put large sums into whole life policies. They got to protect their money from the IRS, and have a death benefit to help their beneficiaries get by if the policyholder died.
Eventually, lawmakers caught on that insurance companies were advertising whole life policies as a way to build cash value without paying regular tax rates. Congress was appalled that life insurance companies had created a tax shelter.
In 1988, Congress passed the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act (TAMRA), which put strict limits on how much could be paid into a life insurance policy. And under the act, any overfunded policy would be moved into a new category -- a modified endowment contract.
When a permanent life insurance contract is converted to an MEC, it will still provide a tax-free death benefit to heirs. Cash value will also accumulate on a tax-deferred basis.
The big difference between a traditional life insurance contract vs. an MEC is that withdrawals and loans from an MEC receive less favorable tax treatment. With traditional cash value life insurance, your withdrawals are treated as a return of the premiums. You aren't taxed until your withdrawals exceed the amount you've paid in. Withdrawals from an MEC are first treated as coming from earnings, therefore, they're taxable. Once you've depleted the earnings, withdrawals won't be taxed. There's also a 10% penalty on withdrawals from an MEC before age 59 1/2.
Your permanent life insurance policy could become an MEC if you overfund it by paying more than you'd need to fully fund the policy in the first seven years. If you buy single-premium life insurance, where you fully fund the policy with a lump-sum payment, it's automatically considered an MEC, as it fails the seven-pay test.
Any material changes to a policy's benefits trigger a new seven-year window. Material changes include increasing the policy's death benefit or adding certain life insurance riders.
Once a policy converts to a modified endowment contract, it cannot be reversed.
Suppose you purchase a $100,000 policy with annual MEC limits of $4,000. In years one and two, you pay $4,000 per year, but in year three, you pay $6,000. Because you've exceeded the aggregate MEC limit in the first seven years, the policy becomes an MEC. Once it exceeds that threshold, the policy becomes a modified endowment contract.
Your insurer will let you know when the cash in your life insurance policy gets dangerously close to the limit. Typically, you'll receive a notification warning you that too much has been paid in.
Remember, though, that if your life insurance policy is converted to an MEC, it will still provide the same financial protection for your loved ones. MEC status will only come into play if you withdraw or borrow against the policy's cash value.
A person can set up a modified endowment contract as part of their estate planning, or they can overpay into a whole life policy, causing it to become a modified endowment contract. Once it's converted, it loses special tax status and is taxed like most other investment vehicles.
An MEC offers many of the same benefits as traditional permanent life insurance, including a tax-free death benefit. There are some situations when setting up an MEC could be advantageous, such as if you have a large amount of money you want to invest in a tax-deferred manner or if you want flexibility on your premium payments. Due to the complexity of life insurance contracts and MECs, discuss your options with a financial advisor.
Yes. Any money borrowed from gains earned on the money is taxable. However, any portion of the loan that's considered part of the principal isn't taxable.

If you own a permanent life insurance policy such as whole life, you’ll likely be aware of its cash value. A portion of your insurance premium is allocated to the cash value, which grows tax-deferred. Although it sounds great, this tax break comes with an asterisk.
If you overfund the account by contributing too much money toward its cash value, the policy could become a modified endowment contract, or MEC. While your life insurance coverage won’t change, you could face additional taxes and penalties for withdrawing money early. But you can avoid the designation if you understand how and when MEC rules apply.
The policy was issued on or after June 21, 1988.
The 7-pay test is what the IRS uses to verify whether a cash value life insurance policy has been overfunded. These policies typically have an annual limit on how much you can pay into the account. This limit is based on the amount of premiums it takes for the policy to be fully paid up in the first seven years. To be fully paid up means the coverage is paid for in full and no more premiums are required to keep the coverage active. Policyholders sometimes pay more than the minimum premium because the additional money goes to the cash value and may boost it. However, if at any point within the first seven years you pay more than the annual limit, the policy will fail the 7-pay test and could be designated an MEC.
For example, if your policy’s annual premium limit is $1,000, and you pay $2,000 in the second year of owning it, it would trigger an MEC conversion.
Once a life insurance policy becomes an MEC, the designation cannot be reversed. But if you overpay, don’t panic. Your insurer will notify you and offer to refund the additional money to avoid an MEC designation. The excess premiums must be returned to you within 60 days after the end of your policy’s contract year to prevent the policy from failing the 7-pay test.
The 7-pay test applies to the first seven years of a policy being active. However, if you make material changes to your coverage, the clock gets reset for another seven years. A material change is something that alters the coverage, such as increasing the death benefit or adding a life insurance rider.
Modified endowment contracts are still life insurance policies, though a different type of contract. The death benefit remains intact, which means your life insurance beneficiaries will still receive the payout when you die. And the cash value account still grows tax-deferred. However, when you withdraw funds from the account, you may be subject to more taxes and fees than with a life insurance policy.
This is because the withdrawals from an MEC are treated differently by the IRS. When you take money from a life insurance policy, the “policy basis” is withdrawn first. The basis is the amount you’ve contributed through your premiums, and you can withdraw it tax-free. So, if you don’t take out more than the basis, you won’t be taxed. Under a modified endowment contract, the gains are withdrawn first, which are taxed as ordinary income.
MEC withdrawals also typically incur a 10% tax penalty if you take out the money before turning 59½ years old. The 10% only applies to the gains, but because the gains are withdrawn first, you’ll likely pay the penalty.
You may come across the term “paid-up additions,” or PUA, when researching modified endowment contracts. A PUA rider essentially allows you to add small amounts of permanent life insurance funded by dividends. Policyholders can use PUAs to increase the policy's overall death benefit and cash value, while maintaining the correct ratio of insurance to investment, and avoid an MEC conversion.
If your policy is designated an MEC, it doesn’t necessarily equal disaster. The MEC rules were created to prevent policyholders from using life insurance policies as tax-free investment havens. If you don’t plan on withdrawing the money early, you could heavily fund the account and take advantage of the tax-deferred growth for retirement or estate planning purposes.
However, if you want to withdraw or borrow against the cash value before retirement, you’ll want to avoid MEC status.
Talk to a fee-based life insurance advisor before making any permanent investment decisions with your life insurance policy.
Yes, 10% penalty on the withdrawal of gains before age 59½.

Modified Endowment Contracts: What You Need to Know

The world of life insurance can be a complex and daunting place, full of technical terms and convoluted concepts. One of the most important – and often misunderstood – is the modified endowment contract, or MEC. But fear not: by the end of this article, you'll have a firm grasp on what an MEC is, how it comes to be, and whether you want to embrace or avoid it.

A modified endowment contract is a type of permanent life insurance policy that still provides a death benefit, but with far fewer tax breaks associated with the cash that accrues. To understand how MECs came to be, let's take a step back in time. In the past, whole life insurance policies were all the rage, offering coverage for life as long as premiums were paid. These policies also built cash value over time, which policyholders could withdraw or borrow against. The cherry on top? The cash earned a guaranteed rate of interest, and the policyholder could reap a slew of tax advantages.

But lawmakers caught wind of the fact that insurance companies were marketing whole life policies as a way to build wealth without paying regular tax rates. Congress wasn't having it, and in 1988, they passed the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act (TAMRA), which put strict limits on how much could be paid into a life insurance policy. And if you overfunded your policy? It would be converted into a modified endowment contract.

So, what's the difference between a traditional life insurance contract and an MEC? Withdrawals and loans from an MEC receive less favorable tax treatment. With traditional cash value life insurance, your withdrawals are treated as a return of premiums – you won't be taxed until you've withdrawn more than you've paid in. But with an MEC, withdrawals are first treated as coming from earnings, making them taxable. And if you withdraw before age 59 1/2, you'll be hit with a 10% penalty.

Your permanent life insurance policy can become an MEC if you overfund it by paying more than you need to fully fund the policy in the first seven years. Or, if you buy single-premium life insurance – where you fully fund the policy with a lump-sum payment – it's automatically considered an MEC. Material changes to a policy's benefits can also trigger a new seven-year window, and once a policy converts to an MEC, it cannot be reversed.

If you're wondering how to avoid an MEC, your insurer will typically let you know when the cash in your life insurance policy gets close to the limit. But if your policy does become an MEC, don't panic – it will still provide the same financial protection for your loved ones. The MEC status will only come into play if you withdraw or borrow against the policy's cash value.

There are some situations where setting up an MEC could be advantageous, such as if you have a large amount of money you want to invest in a tax-deferred manner or if you want flexibility on your premium payments.

**Understanding Modified Endowment Contracts (MECs)**

When it comes to life insurance, there are many questions that come to mind. One of the most important ones is: what is a modified endowment contract (MEC)? By the end of this article, you'll have a clear understanding of what an MEC is, how it's created, and whether it's something you want to consider.

**What is a Modified Endowment Contract?**

A modified endowment contract still provides a death benefit, but unlike most permanent life insurance policies, it offers limited tax breaks on the cash value. To understand MECs better, let's take a step back and look at the history of whole life insurance policies.

**The History of Whole Life Insurance Policies**

Whole life insurance policies were all the rage in the past. They provided coverage for a person's entire life, as long as premiums were paid. What made them stand out was the cash value component, which allowed policyholders to withdraw or borrow against it. Additionally, the cash value earned a guaranteed rate of interest, and policyholders enjoyed significant tax advantages.

**The Creation of Modified Endowment Contracts**

However, lawmakers caught on that insurance companies were marketing whole life policies as a way to build cash value without paying regular tax rates. In response, Congress passed the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act (TAMRA) in 1988, which put strict limits on how much could be paid into a life insurance policy. Any policy that exceeded these limits was converted to a modified endowment contract.

**Key Features of Modified Endowment Contracts**

When a permanent life insurance contract is converted to an MEC, it still provides a tax-free death benefit to beneficiaries. The cash value will also accumulate on a tax-deferred basis. However, the big difference between a traditional life insurance contract and an MEC is the tax treatment of withdrawals and loans. With an MEC, withdrawals are taxed as earnings first, and then as principal. Additionally, there's a 10% penalty on withdrawals before age 59 1/2.

**How to Avoid or Create a Modified Endowment Contract**

Your permanent life insurance policy can become an MEC if you overfund it by paying more than necessary to fully fund the policy in the first seven years. If you buy a single-premium life insurance policy, it's automatically considered an MEC. Material changes to a policy's benefits, such as increasing the death benefit or adding riders, will also trigger a new seven-year window.

**The Impact of Modified Endowment Contracts on Your Policy**

Once a policy is converted to an MEC, it cannot be reversed. If you're not careful, you may end up with an MEC unintentionally. Your insurer will notify you if your policy is getting close to the MEC limit. Remember, an MEC will still provide the same financial protection for your loved ones, but it will have different tax implications.

**When to Consider a Modified Endowment Contract**

In some cases, setting up an MEC can be beneficial, such as if you have a large amount of money you want to invest in a tax-deferred manner or if you want flexibility on your premium payments. However, due to the complexity of life insurance contracts and MECs, it's essential to discuss your options with a financial advisor.

**The Bottom Line**

A modified endowment contract is a type of life insurance policy that offers limited tax breaks on the cash value. While it still provides a death benefit, it's essential to understand the tax implications of withdrawals and loans. By being aware of the rules and limitations, you can make informed decisions about your life insurance policy.

0.46875,"It can be easy to go overboard on holiday shopping. But with some planning and budgeting, celebrating doesn't have to vacuum up all your cash or leave you maxed on on your credit cards. Use these eight practical tips to ensure you stay on budget for the new year, rather than getting wrapped up in holiday spending.
Give your credit card and your mind a holiday by limiting what you buy to what can safely come out of your bank account. Use this opportunity to create or get your budget into fighting shape, and use it to decide how much money you can afford to spend.
The money you can reasonably spend on gifts is money that isn't going to bills. That said, if you want to have a little more to spend, this doesn't have to be just the money left over at the end of the month. You can also use funds you would normally spend elsewhere, such as on your morning latte. As long as you are using cash (not cash advances from credit cards) without spending your rent money, you are doing great.
Remember to be realistic about what you are willing to sacrifice. You may spend your monthly clothing budget on holiday gifts, then come up empty when you need new snow boots.
Santa has to buy presents for the whole world, but you don't. If your shopping list includes more than five people outside of your immediate family, start cutting it.
Then, bake some cookies to give to all the people you snipped from your original gift list. This will ensure you spread the holiday cheer and keep you from looking like Scrooge.
Your older brother paid off his student loans five years ago, and he always gets you the fanciest presents. However, if you are in a different place in your financial life, don't feel you have to follow suit.
If you have any doubts as to whether those on your list will appreciate the less expensive presents you buy them, think back to what your friends and family gave to you when their budgets were tighter. There's no doubt that you'll both be better friends in the new year if you're not creating debt loads for each other this year.
Sales aren't the only way to get great deals on the gifts you want for your friends or family. Before you shop online, perform a quick web search for coupon codes for your favorite online stores.
Before you shop in local stores, comb through the coupons you received in your mailbox. While you search through the flyers, make sure to comparison-shop for the item you're interested in. Savings can happen just by keeping your eyes peeled for deals.
Mom and dad (or other far-away family and friends) might love nothing more than a visit from you. Another idea? Writing up a ""free night of babysitting"" card for family and friends with young children, or ""good for a home-cooked meal"" certificate for your widowed uncle that can be used when the time is right.
Get over the how-am-I-going-to-pay-off-my-credit-cards-next-month anxiety by giving yourself the gift of developing new-and-improved spending habits.
For example, for every dollar you spend on gifts, find a way to remove that dollar from your regular spending. Around the holidays, you can use those savings to buy presents, but next month—and the rest of the year—what you save can go into your emergency fund.
A small, thoughtful gift is worth more than an expensive gift that someone may never use. Avoid the impulse to shop at trendy stores and start the holiday by taking a moment to think about what those on your list could really use.
For example, if your sister loves to bake but can't get the hang of homemade pie crusts, you could buy her a simple pastry-making tool for less than $10 and include a copy of a foolproof recipe.
Your friends probably struggle with overspending as much as you do over the holidays. Give them the relief of forgoing buying gifts for you by organizing a group volunteer day instead. It's possible to volunteer virtually, too. You'll come out of the day feeling proud of your efforts rather than suffering from buyer's remorse, and anyone can benefit from volunteering.
Non-profit VolunteerMatch has a massive online database that you can search to find volunteering opportunities (in-person and virtual) for a wide variety of causes and organizations throughout the United States.
Don't let your debt become the Grinch that robs the fun from your holiday season. Base your gift buying on sentiment rather than dollar value and avoid giving yourself a year-round debt headache. If you can follow these tips, when your holiday bank and credit card statements arrive in the New Year, you'll find yourself singing ""Joy to the World"" all over again.

The holiday season rolls around at the same time each year, but unexpected expenses can catch you, and your wallet, off guard. Creating a holiday budget can help turn those surprises into anticipated costs. It can also give you a solid foundation from the start by saving you lots of time and stress — not to mention also preventing a debt hangover in the new year.
Holiday spending can quickly add up. Over the last five years, Americans have spent an average of $641 on holiday gifts, $224 on nongift items like food and decorations, and $139 on other nongift purchases, according to the National Retail Federation.
That’s about $1,000 on average for holiday-related purchases.
If you’re looking to save on holiday spending, here are some steps to build a holiday budget that works for you year after year.
Setting your priorities early can help ensure that necessary items in your everyday budget aren’t sacrificed.
“You can’t sacrifice your future financial stability in those areas by living it up and celebrating during the current year’s holiday season,” says Bruce McClary, senior vice president of memberships and communications at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.
There are lots of advantages to starting your holiday savings earlier. You’ll have more flexibility in how much you need to save each week or month. Savings in smaller chunks over a longer period of time can make it easier to meet your goal if your budget is already tight.
Starting early also allows you to take better advantage of sales throughout the year, and you won’t have to fight Black Friday crowds for the items you’re looking for. With more time to browse, you can watch secondhand marketplaces for toys or other items in good condition — not to mention there’s less competition, and you won’t feel pressure to buy something just because the clock is ticking.
Setting holiday-specific budget categories you can return to each year will help you prioritize your spending and make it more predictable. Here are some common holiday spending categories.
The holiday season is a time for giving. While narrowing down your gift list can be a challenge, it should be your first step. Your gifting budget should also include any gift wrapping supplies, as well as shipping costs for gifts that need to be sent through the mail.
Gifts are likely to make up a big portion of your holiday budget, so finding ways to save can create some breathing room. Consider making your own gifts — using supplies you can buy in bulk — to give something meaningful to neighbors, teachers and others in your community. Suggest that friends and family draw names for gifts to reduce the number you’ll need to buy. Sticking to a gift list with price limits for each person, cashing in the credit card rewards or points you’ve earned, and paying with unused gift cards you have stashed are also other ways to save money.
For many people, the holidays are a time spent visiting friends and family who don’t live nearby. Account for gas or tolls, airfare and bag fees, as well as hotel stays — and make sure to budget for food as well while you travel.
If you’re flying, make a plan for how to get gifts to and from your final destination. Bringing an extra duffel bag to check or shipping gifts home are some options, but either will require an extra line item in your budget.
Between hosting parties and extra holiday baking, your grocery bill might be higher than usual. The holiday season is also filled with opportunities for fun outings. Entertainment costs might include tickets to see “The Nutcracker” ballet or photos with Santa, for example.
If you find yourself overspending in other categories, entertainment might be a place where you can save. Checking out festive decorations in your town, joining a community menorah lighting or having an at-home movie night don’t cost a thing.
This category includes things like the cost for your annual Christmas tree or party outfits. You might need to put a little extra money in this category if you want to update or add to your home decor or your wardrobe — especially if you have kids who outgrew last year's holiday outfits.
Nonprofits and charities kick giving campaigns into high gear during the holiday season, so it’s likely you’ll encounter folks asking for donations. Establishing how charitable giving fits into your budget at the outset will keep you on track in the face of many giving opportunities.
Tipping service providers is also a nice gesture, especially if they are people you interact with frequently (like a doorman, nanny or mail carrier).
Here’s the thing about building a reusable holiday budget: Not all categories will need to be funded the same way each year — or at all — depending on your circumstances.
Maybe you travel to your in-laws’ for the holidays only every other year, so you don’t need to put any money in the travel category this year. Perhaps an unexpected home repair means you’ll need to cut down on your gift list to avoid debt.
However, keeping the categories in place as a reminder about potential expenses will help as you revisit your holiday budget every year. Let your circumstances and priorities guide your budget.
If you’re looking to budget beyond the holidays, a 50-30-20 budget might be for you. This budget categorizes your take-home pay into needs (50%), wants (30%) and debt repayment and savings (20%).
If you’re still unsure about how much money to put toward each category, try reviewing last year’s holiday spending. Pull up your bank and credit card statements to see what you spent money on. Were you happy with your spending? Were there any expenses that caught you off guard? If so, those numbers might offer some good parameters moving forward. If you overspent, now’s the time to make things right by setting a realistic budget and sticking to it.
Now that you’ve set up your budget categories and decided how much you want to save, it’s time to actually fund your budget and find a place to keep your savings so you can track your progress.
A sinking fund is a way to gradually save for planned expenses in smaller chunks over time.  This is a perfect tool for holiday spending because the holidays are predictable (they come at the same time each year), and it allows you to keep track of your progress. You can either set a target deadline to hit your savings goal or use your sinking fund to pay for things like holiday gifts as you buy them throughout the year.
One of the best places to put your holiday savings is in a high-yield savings account. This separate account gets the cash out of your personal savings where it might be tempting to use it for another purchase since it’s easy to access. With your money safely tucked away, it will continue to grow as the interest adds up.
A high-yield savings account is “a great way to make saving for the holidays a habit and to move the money that you're saving into an account that may give a little bit more in return when it comes time to withdraw the funds and to put them to use,” McClary says.

Staying on Budget This Holiday Season: 8 Practical Tips

The holiday season is a time for celebration, but it's easy to get caught up in the excitement and overspend. However, with some planning and budgeting, you can enjoy the festive season without breaking the bank. Here are eight practical tips to help you stay on budget and avoid debt.

Tip 1: Create a Budget and Stick to It
Start by assessing your financial situation and determining how much you can afford to spend on gifts, festivities, and other holiday expenses. Be realistic about what you can afford, and make sure you're not sacrificing essential expenses like rent and bills.

Tip 2: Use Cash, Not Credit
Try to use cash instead of credit cards for your holiday expenses. This will help you stick to your budget and avoid accumulating debt. Consider setting aside a specific amount of cash for gifts and other expenses, and avoid dipping into your savings or emergency fund.

Tip 3: Prioritize Your Spending
Make a list of the people you need to buy gifts for, and prioritize your spending based on importance. Consider cutting back on gifts for acquaintances or coworkers, and focus on spending quality time with loved ones instead.

Tip 4: Get Creative with Gifts
Instead of buying expensive gifts, consider making something yourself, like baked goods or a homemade card. You can also offer services like babysitting or pet-sitting, which can be just as valuable as a physical gift.

Tip 5: Take Advantage of Sales and Coupons
Before you start shopping, do some research and look for sales and coupons that can help you save money. You can also consider buying gifts during off-peak seasons or using cashback apps to earn rewards.

Tip 6: Give Experiences, Not Stuff
Instead of buying physical gifts, consider giving experiences, like tickets to a concert or a fun activity. This can be a more meaningful and memorable way to show your love and appreciation.

Tip 7: Practice Mindful Spending
Be mindful of your spending habits and avoid impulse purchases. Take time to think about what you really need, and avoid buying things that aren't essential or won't be used.

Tip 8: Focus on What Really Matters
Remember, the holiday season is about more than just gifts and material possessions. Focus on spending quality time with loved ones, volunteering, and giving back to your community.

By following these tips, you can enjoy the holiday season without breaking the bank. Remember to prioritize your spending, be mindful of your budget, and focus on what really matters. Happy holidays!

**Stay on Budget This Holiday Season: 8 Practical Tips to Avoid Debt**

The holiday season is upon us, and it's easy to get caught up in the spirit of giving. But before you know it, your credit card balance can skyrocket, and you'll be left with a debt hangover that can last well into the new year. Don't let that be you. With some planning and budgeting, you can celebrate the holidays without breaking the bank.

**Tip 1: Use Cash, Not Credit**

Make a plan to use only the cash you have in your bank account for holiday expenses. This will help you avoid overspending and accumulating debt. Consider setting aside a specific amount each month leading up to the holidays to build up your funds.

**Tip 2: Rethink Your Gift List**

Be realistic about who you need to buy gifts for. If you have a long list of friends and acquaintances, consider scaling back or getting creative with low-cost gifts. And remember, it's the thought that counts, not the price tag.

**Tip 3: Get Creative with Gifts**

Think beyond traditional gifts and consider experiences or homemade treats instead. A thoughtful, handmade gift or a fun activity can be just as meaningful as a pricey present.

**Tip 4: Avoid Impulse Buys**

Stick to your shopping list and avoid browsing online or in stores. Impulse buys can quickly add up and blow your budget.

**Tip 5: Use Coupons and Deals**

Do some research and look for coupons, discounts, and promotions that can help you save money on your holiday shopping.

**Tip 6: Give the Gift of Time**

Consider giving gifts of time or skill instead of physical presents. This can be a great way to show you care without breaking the bank.

**Tip 7: Start a New Tradition**

Instead of focusing on gifts, consider starting a new holiday tradition with friends and family, such as a volunteer day or a potluck dinner.

**Tip 8: Focus on Sentiment, Not Price**

Remember, it's the thought that counts, not the price tag. Focus on finding gifts that are meaningful and thoughtful, rather than expensive.

By following these tips, you can stay on budget and avoid debt this holiday season. Happy holidays!

0.458762886597938,"Most people have heard the old saying, ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket."" The logic: If a farmer were to stumble while bringing the basket of eggs back from the henhouse, they could end up with a messy situation. Those words of wisdom go well beyond farming; they also perfectly encapsulate the idea of not risking all your money on a single investment.
One way investors can reduce their risk of a cracked nest egg is by diversifying their portfolio. Here's a look at what that means, as well as three tips to help you quickly diversify your investments.
A diversified portfolio is a collection of different investments that combine to reduce an investor's overall risk profile. Diversification includes owning stocks from several different industries, countries, and risk profiles, as well as other investments such as bonds, commodities, and real estate. These various assets work together to reduce an investor's risk of a permanent loss of capital and their portfolio's overall volatility. In exchange, the returns from a diversified portfolio tend to be lower than what an investor might earn if they were able to pick a single winning stock.

A diversified portfolio should have a broad mix of investments. For years, many financial advisors recommended building a 60/40 portfolio, allocating 60% of capital to stocks and 40% to fixed-income investments such as bonds. Meanwhile, others have argued for more stock exposure, especially for younger investors.
One of the keys to a diversified portfolio is owning a wide variety of different stocks. That means holding a mix of tech stocks, energy stocks, and healthcare stocks, as well as some from other industries. An investor doesn't need exposure to every sector but should focus on holding a wide variety of high-quality companies. Further, investors should consider large-cap stocks, small-cap stocks, dividend stocks, growth stocks, and value stocks.
In addition to owning a diversified stock portfolio, investors should also consider holding some non-correlated investments (e.g., those whose prices don't ebb and flow with the daily gyrations of stock market indexes). Non-stock diversification options include bonds, bank certificates of deposit (CDs), gold, cryptocurrencies, and real estate.

Building a diversified portfolio can seem like a daunting task since there are so many investment options. Here are three tips to make it easy for beginners to diversify.
One of the quickest ways to build a diversified portfolio is to invest in several stocks. A good rule of thumb is to own at least 25 different companies.
However, it's important that they also be from a variety of industries. Although it might be tempting to purchase shares of a dozen well-known tech giants and call it a day, that's not proper diversification. If tech spending takes a hit due to an economic slowdown or new government regulations, all those companies' shares could decline in unison. Investors should make sure they spread their investment dollars around several industries.
One quick way to do that for those who don't have the time to research stocks is to buy an index fund. For example, an S&P 500 index fund will aim to match the S&P 500's performance. The benefit of index funds is that they take a lot of guesswork out of investing while offering instant diversification. For example, with an S&P 500 index fund, you're buying shares of a single fund that gives you exposure to 500 of the largest public U.S. companies.
Another great thing about index funds is that their fees -- known as expense ratios -- are very low. That's because, with the best index funds, you're not paying for the expertise of a fund manager who's going to research and hand-pick investments for you.
Although adding some bonds reduces a portfolio's average annual rate of return, it also tends to mute the loss in the worst year and cut down on the number of years with a loss.
While picking bonds can be even more daunting than selecting stocks, there are easy ways to get some fixed-income exposure. One of them is to buy a bond-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Investors who want to take their portfolio diversification to another level should consider adding real estate to the mix. Real estate has historically increased a portfolio's total return while reducing its overall volatility.
An easy way to do this is by investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs), which own income-producing commercial real estate. The sector has an excellent track record. In the 25-year period ending in 2021, REITs, as measured by the FTSE Nareit All Equity REIT Index, generated an average annual total return of 11.5%.
Several studies have found that an optimal portfolio will include a 5% to 15% allocation to REITs. For example, a portfolio with 55% stocks, 35% bonds, and 10% REITs has historically outperformed a 60% stock/40% bond portfolio with only slightly more volatility while matching the returns of an 80% stock/20% bond portfolio with less volatility.
Interest compounds when interest payments also earn interest. Learn how to get compounding interest working for your portfolio.
Exchange-traded funds let an investor buy lots of stocks and bonds at once.

Diversification is about tradeoffs. It reduces an investor's exposure to a single stock, industry, or investment option. While that can potentially cut into an investor's return potential, it also reduces volatility and, more importantly, the risk of a bad outcome. Investors should take diversification seriously. Otherwise, they're taking a big gamble that an outsized bet won't spoil their hopes of expanding their nest egg to support them in their golden years.
A well-diversified portfolio invests in many different asset classes. It has a relatively low allocation to any single security. Because of that, if one security significantly underperforms, it won't have a meaningful impact on the portfolio's overall return. However, a well-diversified portfolio will typically deliver returns that roughly match those of the overall market.
A diversified portfolio contains a mix of asset types and investment vehicles. A diversified portfolio will typically hold several different stocks. An ideal diversified portfolio would include companies from various industries, those in different stages of their growth cycle (e.g., early stage and mature), some companies from foreign countries, and companies across a range of market capitalizations (small, mid, and large). In addition, it would hold bonds, cash, real estate, and commodities.

When the market is booming, it seems almost impossible to sell a stock for any amount less than the price at which you bought it. However, since we can never be sure of what the market will do at any moment, we cannot forget the importance of a well-diversified portfolio in any market condition.
For establishing an investing strategy that tempers potential losses in a bear market, the investment community preaches the same thing the real estate market preaches for buying a house: ""location, location, location."" Simply put, you should never put all your eggs in one basket. This is the central thesis on which the concept of diversification lies.
Read on to find out why diversification is important for your portfolio, and five tips to help you make smart choices.
Diversification is a battle cry for many financial planners, fund managers, and individual investors alike. It is a management strategy that blends different investments in a single portfolio. The idea behind diversification is that a variety of investments will yield a higher return. It also suggests that investors will face lower risk by investing in different vehicles.
Diversification is not a new concept. With the luxury of hindsight, we can sit back and critique the gyrations and reactions of the markets as they began to stumble during the dotcom crash, the Great Recession, and again during the COVID-19 recession.
We should remember that investing is an art form, not a knee-jerk reaction, so the time to practice disciplined investing with a diversified portfolio is before diversification becomes a necessity. By the time an average investor ""reacts"" to the market, 80% of the damage is already done. Here, more than most places, a good offense is your best defense, and a well-diversified portfolio combined with an investment horizon over five years can weather most storms.
Equities can be wonderful, but don't put all of your money in one stock or one sector. Consider creating your own virtual mutual fund by investing in a handful of companies you know, trust, and even use in your day-to-day life.
But stocks aren't just the only thing to consider. You can also invest in commodities, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and real estate investment trusts (REITs). And don't just stick to your own home base. Think beyond it and go global. This way, you'll spread your risk around, which can lead to bigger rewards.
People will argue that investing in what you know will leave the average investor too heavily retail-oriented, but knowing a company, or using its goods and services, can be a healthy and wholesome approach to this sector.
Still, don't fall into the trap of going too far. Make sure you keep yourself to a portfolio that's manageable. There's no sense in investing in 100 different vehicles when you really don't have the time or resources to keep up. Try to limit yourself to about 20 to 30 different investments.
You may want to consider adding index funds or fixed-income funds to the mix. Investing in securities that track various indexes makes a wonderful long-term diversification investment for your portfolio. By adding some fixed-income solutions, you are further hedging your portfolio against market volatility and uncertainty. These funds try to match the performance of broad indexes, so rather than investing in a specific sector, they try to reflect the bond market's value.
These funds often come with low fees, which is another bonus. It means more money in your pocket. The management and operating costs are minimal because of what it takes to run these funds.
One potential drawback of index funds could be their passively managed nature. While hands-off investing is generally inexpensive, it can be suboptimal in inefficient markets. Active management can be beneficial in fixed-income markets, for example, especially during challenging economic periods.
Add to your investments on a regular basis. If you have $10,000 to invest, use dollar-cost averaging. This approach is used to help smooth out the peaks and valleys created by market volatility. The idea behind this strategy is to cut down your investment risk by investing the same amount of money over a period of time.
With dollar-cost averaging, you invest money on a regular basis into a specified portfolio of securities. Using this strategy, you'll buy more shares when prices are low, and fewer when prices are high.
Buying and holding and dollar-cost averaging are sound strategies. But just because you have your investments on autopilot doesn't mean you should ignore the forces at work.
Stay current with your investments and stay abreast of any changes in overall market conditions. You'll want to know what is happening to the companies you invest in. By doing so, you'll also be able to tell when it's time to cut your losses, sell, and move on to your next investment.
If you are not the trading type, understand what you are getting for the fees you are paying. Some firms charge a monthly fee, while others charge transactional fees. These can definitely add up and chip away at your bottom line.
Be aware of what you are paying and what you are getting for it. Remember, the cheapest choice is not always the best. Keep yourself updated on whether there are any changes to your fees.
Today, many online brokers have moved to $0 commission-free trading in many stocks and ETFs, making this point less of a concern. However, trading mutual funds, illiquid stocks, and alternative assets classes will still often come with a fee.
Diversification helps investors to not ""put all of their eggs in one basket."" The idea is that if one stock, sector, or asset class slumps, others may rise. This is especially true if the securities or assets held are not closely correlated with one another. Mathematically, diversification reduces the portfolio's overall risk without sacrificing its expected return.
By definition, an index fund or ETF replicates some index. Depending on which index it may be more diversified than others. For instance, the S&P 500 has more than 500 stock components while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has only 30, making it far less diversified.1Even if you own an S&P 500 index fund, it is not necessarily a diversified portfolio since you should also include other low-correlation asset classes, including bonds, but also modest allocations to commodities, real estate, and alternative investments, among others.
Yes. If adding a new investment to a portfolio increases its overall risk and/or lowers its expected return (without reducing the risk accordingly), it does not serve the goals of diversification. This ""over-diversification"" tends to happen when there are already an ideal number of securities in a portfolio, or if you are adding closely-correlated securities.
A diversified portfolio's risk is measured by its total standard deviation of returns. The larger the standard deviation, the greater its expected riskiness.
Investing can and should be fun. It can be educational, informative, and rewarding. By taking a disciplined approach and using diversification, buy-and-hold and dollar-cost-averaging strategies, you may find investing rewarding even in the worst of times.

Diversification: A Key to Reducing Portfolio Risk

The age-old adage ""don't put all your eggs in one basket"" is a wise principle that extends far beyond farming. It serves as a poignant reminder to investors of the importance of diversification in reducing their overall risk profile.

A diversified portfolio is a collection of different investments that work together to minimize an investor's exposure to risk. By combining stocks from various industries, countries, and risk profiles, along with other investments such as bonds, commodities, and real estate, an investor can significantly reduce their risk of permanent loss of capital and portfolio volatility.

In exchange for this reduced risk, investors may need to accept lower returns compared to investing in a single, high-performing stock. However, a diversified portfolio can provide a more stable and consistent return over the long term.

Building a diversified portfolio involves owning a mix of different investments. A traditional approach has been to allocate 60% of capital to stocks and 40% to fixed-income investments such as bonds. However, some investors may prefer a more aggressive approach, particularly younger investors.

One key to a diversified portfolio is owning a wide variety of stocks. This includes holding a mix of technology stocks, energy stocks, healthcare stocks, and others from various industries. An investor does not need exposure to every sector, but rather should focus on holding a diverse range of high-quality companies.

In addition to stock diversification, investors should also consider holding non-correlated investments, such as bonds, bank certificates of deposit (CDs), gold, cryptocurrencies, and real estate. These investments can provide a hedge against market volatility and reduce an investor's overall risk profile.

For beginners, building a diversified portfolio can seem daunting. However, here are three tips to get started:

1. Invest in a variety of stocks. A good rule of thumb is to own at least 25 different companies from various industries. This can help reduce risk and increase the potential for long-term returns.

2. Consider investing in index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These funds provide instant diversification and can be a low-cost way to invest in a broad range of assets.

3. Add bonds to your portfolio. Bonds can provide a fixed income stream and help reduce overall portfolio volatility. A simple way to invest in bonds is through a bond-focused ETF.

Real estate is another important aspect of diversification. Investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) can provide a steady income stream and help reduce overall portfolio volatility. Historically, REITs have generated strong returns over the long term, making them an attractive addition to a diversified portfolio.

In conclusion, diversification is a crucial aspect of investing. By spreading investments across various asset classes, industries, and risk profiles, investors can reduce their overall risk profile and increase the potential for long-term returns. While diversification may not guarantee a profit, it can help investors sleep better at night, knowing that their portfolio is well-positioned to weather market volatility.

When you make a withdrawal from a standard 403(b) account, the amount distributed to you is taxed at your regular income tax rate. If you have a Roth 403(b) account, you won't owe any taxes because you'll have paid them in the year you contributed.
Importantly, you're not required to take a distribution from your 403(b) when any of the above events occur. You can simply leave the funds in your account, although that's rarely the best option.
If you're using the wrong credit or debit card, it could be costing you serious money.

In fact, this card is so good that our experts use it personally. Click here to read our full review for free and apply in just 2 minutes.
In some cases, you can make early withdrawals from a 403(b) without paying a penalty.
Similar to a 401(k), 403(b) account holders can start taking distributions in the year they leave work as long as they turn 55 or older in that same year. This is commonly referred to as the rule of 55. The biggest caveat is that all funds must remain in the 403(b) plan for early withdrawals to remain penalty-free.
Another option is to take substantially equal periodic payments under rule 72(t). You can start taking 72(t) distributions at any point, but once you do, you're committing to take those distributions for at least five years or until you turn 59 1/2, whichever is later.
If you need access to your 403(b) funds before the year you turn 55 and 72(t) distributions won't suffice, you'll probably end up paying a 10% penalty on any withdrawals you make on top of any income taxes owed on the withdrawal.
There are a couple key exceptions to the penalty. You won't pay the penalty for withdrawals after you've become disabled. Furthermore, if the withdrawal covers unreimbursed medical expenses greater than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, you won't pay a penalty either. That means that if you have a medical emergency and have to pay out of pocket, you can use your retirement savings as a safety net.
Just like a 401(k) or an IRA, a 403(b) account has required minimum distributions (RMDs) beginning at 72. RMDs are calculated based on the account balance at the end of the prior year and the IRS life expectancy tables.
Most plan administrators will automatically calculate and distribute RMDs to participants when they turn 72. If you fail to take the distribution, however, you'll be subject to a 50% tax, and you'll still need to take the distribution.
Rolling over a 403(b) into another retirement account is likely the best strategy for someone after they switch jobs or leave the workforce. 403(b) plans often charge administrative fees on top of fees for the mutual fund options in the plan. Rolling over funds to a different account can open less expensive and more flexible options.
Rolling over a 403(b) account is technically a distribution, but, because you're depositing the funds into another tax-advantaged retirement account, you won't pay any early withdrawal penalty or taxes. The only caveat is you must deposit any 403(b) distributions into a qualified account within 60 days of receiving it. Often a plan administrator or financial institution will transfer assets automatically, which will ensure it happens quickly.
You can roll over a 403(b) into an IRA, a SEP IRA, a SIMPLE IRA, a 457(b), a 401(k), or even another 403(b). You can roll over the funds into a designated Roth account in any of those plans, but you'll owe income taxes on the entire amount unless the rollover comes from a designated Roth 403(b) account. Note that Roth 403(b) accounts cannot be rolled over into pre-tax retirement accounts, only other Roth accounts.
Some 403(b) plans include a loan option, which allows you to access your retirement funds for a big purchase and then pay yourself back (with interest) over time.
You can take a loan of up to $50,000, or 50% of your account balance. Some plans have an exception for participants with less than $10,000 in their account, which allows them to withdraw the full amount.
You have to pay back the loan within five years, with payments occurring at least once per quarter. The payments are withheld from your paycheck just like regular 403(b) contributions.
If you leave the company before paying back the loan, you'll have to pay back the entire balance. If not, the balance will be treated as a distribution, and you'll have to pay taxes and a penalty.
Getting a 403(b) loan can be an easy way to gain temporary access to your retirement funds without fully depleting the account. That said, there are costs to consider, including the risk of leaving tax-advantaged retirement funds uninvested.

You’ve contributed to your 403(b) plan faithfully for a number of years. You’re about to retire. Now what? How (or if) you should withdraw that money depends on a number of factors and options available to you.
First of all, you are not required to take all out of your 403(b) account when you retire. In fact, you don't have to take out any funds from the account at all when you finally leave the workforce. If you leave funds in your 403(b) account, they will continue to accumulate until you withdraw them, annuitize them, or roll them over later.
If you retire before the age of 55 and you do plan to make withdrawals, you will have to pay regular income taxes plus a 10% penalty on the amount, unless you agree to substantially equal periodic payments (SEPP) for at least five years or until you reach the age of 59½—whichever is later.
If you are 55 or older when you retire, you can choose to withdraw some or all of your funds in a lump sum. Paradoxically, however, any amount you withdraw does not qualify as a lump-sum distribution under the 10-year tax option, according to the IRS.
No matter what type of 403(b) plan you have, you may wish to annuitize some or all of it when you retire. By arranging to receive periodic, fixed payouts, you provide yourself with a guaranteed income stream for life (or some period), no matter how the stock market or the economy performs.
Most experts warn against annuitizing the entire balance in your retirement plan especially if you already receive a defined benefit pension. If you have a pension, it means part of your retirement income is already in annuity form, so to speak; you might want to retain flexibility with your other assets.
Most experts discourage annuitizing all of the funds in a 403(b) account to allow an investor to realize higher overall investment returns.
But why do a rollover? To take advantage of more ready access to your funds, different and more varied investment options, or better money management during your retirement years.
In terms of treating the hard-earned contents of your 403(b) plan, the majority of 403(b) plan owners may find a combination of some sort of annuity and investment portfolio is best. This provides a steady income stream as well as the ability to achieve some capital appreciation.

**403(b) Retirement Plan Withdrawals: What You Need to Know**

If you're a teacher or nonprofit worker, you're likely familiar with a 403(b) retirement plan, which is similar to a 401(k) plan. But when it comes to withdrawing your hard-earned savings, you may be wondering what options are available to you. After all, it's your money.

**Tax Implications of Withdrawals**

When you make a withdrawal from a standard 403(b) account, the amount distributed to you is taxed at your regular income tax rate. However, if you have a Roth 403(b) account, you won't owe any taxes because you've already paid them in the year you contributed.

**No Required Distributions**

Importantly, you're not required to take a distribution from your 403(b) when you turn 55 or retire. You can simply leave the funds in your account, although that's rarely the best option.

**Early Withdrawals and Penalties**

In some cases, you can make early withdrawals from a 403(b) without paying a penalty.

0.428571428571429,"Many divorcing couples only think about how to divide assets, but figuring out what to do with debt is just as important.
Credit cards help people pay for the things they need, and many married couples use joint credit cards in order to make it easier to track their spending and stay within their total budgets. Because many married couples end up pooling their finances, having a shared way to spend money that matches up with their joint bank accounts makes sense.
However, opening a joint credit card account also carries responsibilities for both spouses, and joint cards become problematic when couples get divorced. It's vital to include any joint credit card accounts in financial agreements that are made in the course of divorce proceedings and -- when at all possible -- close those joint cards quickly. That's the best way to make sure tensions don't flare up long after ex-spouses have ended their marriage.
To fully understand why joint credit cards can cause challenges in a divorce situation, it's useful to understand the different ways that two people can share a credit card. With a joint credit card, either spouse can use the card without the other's permission, but both spouses are ultimately financially responsible for the debt. In order to get a joint credit card in the first place, the card-issuing institution will consider the credit histories of both spouses. Once the account is open, both spouses will get the benefits of good credit practices like making timely payments, but both will also suffer the penalties for missing payment deadlines or going over a credit limit.
The other common way that two people share credit cards is by adding one spouse as an authorized user to the other spouse's card account. With that system, either spouse is authorized to make purchases using the card, but only the one who actually opened the account is on the hook with the card issuer for repaying its balance. Card issuers typically put limits on authorized users' account access, leaving control solely in the hands of the primary account holder. The spouse who applies for the card can choose to only include their own income when qualifying for the card, but most banks let applicants include spousal income on applications because there's a reasonable expectation that married couples will share financial resources.
The goal of divorce proceedings is to allow for the division of assets and debts between the two ex-spouses so that they can each disentangle from one another's financial lives. With assets, that's often relatively simple, because the two ex-spouses can equally divide financial assets like cash or investments. The couple can agree that one ex-spouse will get a personal residence in exchange for the other getting more money, or they can agree to sell hard-to-divide assets and split the cash proceeds.
With debt, however, things are more complicated. Lenders won't just agree to let one ex-spouse off the hook on a joint debt because that would reduce the chances they'll be repaid. That leaves one ex-spouse vulnerable to the bad actions of the other.
Moreover, even if your divorce decree specifically talks about what's supposed to happen with your joint card debt, that decree only applies to you and your ex-spouse. If your ex doesn't live up to their side of the bargain, then the card issuer doesn't have to deal with the consequences. They can simply require you to pay -- leaving you to go back to the divorce court to try to collect from your ex directly.
This is why the ideal solution in divorce is to eliminate all joint debt and close any remaining joint credit cards. That way, each ex-spouse can open individual credit card accounts if they wish and make their own decisions going forward about whether they want to incur any additional debt.
However, that solution is possible only if there are enough assets to pay down that debt. Many couples don't have enough joint savings to pay down their credit cards entirely, and following a divorce, it's possible that ex-spouses won't have good enough credit histories on their own to be able to replace joint credit cards with individual card accounts.
In that case, the best alternative is to try to minimize the amount of ongoing joint card debt while being as upfront as possible with your card issuer. Some issuers will allow you to take your name off a joint account if your ex-spouse’s credit history is good enough for him or her to qualify for the card alone.
Another alternative is to use balance transfers to get the outstanding balances on joint credit cards transferred to new cards held in each ex-spouse's individual name. Because the new accounts won't be joint, the transferred amount will be the liability of each individual ex-spouse. As long as the joint card is paid down by the transfers and then closed, this will result in a separation of the two ex-spouses' debts.
Finally, in trying to craft a divorce decree that handles debts fairly, it's useful to know how joint debts are treated legally. The answers depend on where you live, because state laws can differ widely.
In most states, joint credit card debt during marriage is the joint responsibility of both spouses. However, when one spouse has their own individual cards, those debts are the sole responsibility of that spouse.
However, in states with community property laws, even individual card debt incurred during marriage leaves both spouses potentially responsible for repayment. Those states include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Alaska offers either community property or regular treatment at the couple's discretion.
If you're in a community property state, then it's possible that banks will treat the portion of your ex-spouse's individual card debt that was incurred during the marriage as joint debt. That makes it important to establish and document the amount of each ex-spouse's debt at the time of the divorce -- and, ideally, to make arrangements to pay it down just like you would your joint card debt.
Because of how complicated these situations can get, the use of joint credit cards has gradually diminished over time in favor of the simpler authorized-user system. Nevertheless, if you already have joint credit cards and are getting divorced, then handling them as quickly as possible is the best solution to avoid unnecessary pain and complications after your divorce becomes final.

A divorce isn't just an emotional challenge, it's a logistical one, too. But while you're sorting out who gets what, it's important to make sure that you'll be able to land on your feet financially and won't be saddled with your former spouse's debt. Here are four ways to protect your credit during a divorce.
Unfortunately, a divorce doesn't affect your responsibility to pay off a joint debt. For example, if you co-signed a credit card with your spouse and the spouse takes over the card after the split, you are still legally on the hook for any debts he or she incurs on the card. If your ex falls behind on the payments, it’ll impact your credit score — and you might end up having to go to court. Moreover, depending on state laws, collections agencies might still be able to try to collect debt even after it’s off your credit report.
Generally speaking, a divorce decree does not affect agreements with your lender or card issuer — and your divorce is not on your credit report. You’ll have to go through every joint credit card account, cancel it, and transfer the remaining balance to a card in the name of whoever’s assuming responsibility for the debt.
As unlikely as it may seem, there’s always a chance that your spouse might do something to ruin your finances, like draining a joint checking account. To keep yourself covered, open a checking account in your own name (if you don't already have one) and start depositing your paychecks into that account.
While you’re at it, make sure that all automatic payments for the credit cards and bills in your name are coming out of your own checking account, so you aren’t hit by late-payment fees once you close the joint account.
After you’ve closed all your joint credit cards, you’ll probably want to open some of your own. If you haven’t already started building your own credit, start by applying for a low-limit credit card and gradually increasing the limit.
Take steps to ensure that your spouse can’t access your financial information. Change the PINs on your debit cards and the passwords on all your bank account websites, and make sure that your former partner can’t easily guess the answers to your security questions. If you’ve already moved out, make sure to update your address with creditors and financial institutions. Not only will this ensure that important information gets to the right place, but it will add a layer of security against your ex snooping.
The idea that your former spouse might try to ruin your finances after a divorce may sound crazy, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. These steps will help you protect your money and make a fresh start.

**The Hidden Dangers of Joint Credit Cards in Divorce**

Many of us think that dividing assets is the most critical step in divorce proceedings. But what about debt? Specifically, what about joint credit cards? These can be a significant source of tension and financial stress for ex-spouses long after the divorce is finalized.

**The Joy and Pain of Joint Credit Cards**

Joint credit cards can make sense for married couples. They provide a convenient way to track expenses and stay within budget. However, when divorce comes knocking, these joint cards can become a major headache. That's because both spouses are equally responsible for the debt, regardless of who incurred it.

**Understanding the Different Types of Shared Credit Cards**

There are two common ways to share credit cards: joint credit cards and authorized user accounts. With a joint credit card, both spouses can use the card without permission, and both are responsible for repayment. When applying for a joint credit card, the card issuer considers the credit history of both spouses. With an authorized user account, one spouse adds the other as an authorized user, allowing them to make purchases, but only the primary account holder is responsible for repayment.

**The Divorce Conundrum: Who Pays the Debt?**

Divorce proceedings aim to separate the financial lives of ex-spouses. With assets, this is relatively straightforward. However, debt is a different story. Lenders won't simply let one ex-spouse off the hook, leaving the other vulnerable to their ex's actions.

**The Ideal Solution: Eliminating Joint Debt**

The best solution is to eliminate all joint debt and close joint credit cards. This way, each ex-spouse can open individual credit card accounts and make their own decisions about debt going forward. However, this requires sufficient assets to pay down the debt. If not, ex-spouses may need to rely on alternative solutions, such as balance transfers or negotiating with card issuers.

**State Laws and Joint Debt**

State laws vary widely in their treatment of joint debt. In community property states, even individual card debt incurred during marriage can be considered joint debt. This makes it essential to document each ex-spouse's debt at the time of divorce and make arrangements to pay it down.

**Avoiding Pain and Complications**

The use of joint credit cards has decreased in favor of authorized-user systems due to the complexities and potential pitfalls. If you're getting divorced and have joint credit cards, it's essential to handle them quickly and efficiently to avoid unnecessary stress and financial complications.

**Divorce and Joint Credit Cards: What You Need to Know**

When couples get divorced, they often focus on dividing assets, but figuring out what to do with debt is just as crucial. Joint credit cards, which many married couples use to track spending and stay within their budget, can become a source of tension after a divorce.

**The Problem with Joint Credit Cards**

With a joint credit card account, both spouses are financially responsible for the debt, even if only one of them has been making charges. The credit card issuer considers both spouses' credit histories when approving the account, and both benefit from good credit practices, such as timely payments, but also suffer the penalties for missing payments or exceeding credit limits.

**Authorized Users vs. Joint Accounts**

Another way couples share credit cards is by adding one spouse as an authorized user to the other's account. In this case, only the primary account holder is responsible for repayment, and they can set limits on the authorized user's access to the account.

**Dividing Debt in a Divorce**

The goal of divorce proceedings is to allow each ex-spouse to disentangle from the other's financial life. With assets, this is often straightforward, but debt is more complicated. Lenders won't simply let one ex-spouse off the hook, leaving the other vulnerable to the other's actions.

**Ideal Solution: Eliminate Joint Debt**

The best solution is to eliminate all joint debt and close any remaining joint credit cards. This way, each ex-spouse can open individual credit card accounts if they wish and make their own decisions about incurring debt.

**But What If You Can't Pay Off the Debt?**

If there aren't enough assets to pay down the debt, the best alternative is to try to minimize the amount of ongoing joint card debt while being upfront with your card issuer. Some issuers will allow you to remove your name from a joint account if your ex-spouse's credit history is good enough to qualify for the card alone.

**Balance Transfers: Another Option**

Another alternative is to use balance transfers to move the outstanding balances on joint credit cards to new cards held in each ex-spouse's individual name. This will separate the debts, and as long as the joint card is paid down and then closed, each ex-spouse will be responsible for their own debt.

**State Laws and Joint Debt**

State laws can differ widely when it comes to joint credit card debt during marriage. In community property states, both spouses may be responsible for repayment of individual card debt incurred during the marriage.

**Handling Joint Credit Cards in a Divorce**

In conclusion, handling joint credit cards quickly and effectively is essential to avoiding unnecessary pain and complications after a divorce. By understanding the different ways joint credit cards work, you can make informed decisions about how to divide debt and move forward with your financial lives.

If you're considering a move to New Mexico, you're not the only one. It's been a popular place for home buyers, resulting in a rapid rise in the median home sales price to $363,300 in August 2023. This is an 18.2% gain for the state from the same time a year prior.

Not surprisingly, homes for sale in New Mexico are few, with just two months of inventory available in August 2023, and homes listed for sale during the same month are down 16% year over year.

To get your monthly mortgage payments with our calculator, enter your mortgage loan amount (there's an option to enter your down payment amount as well), the term of your loan, and the rate you expect to get. The term of your loan is the number of years you have to repay your mortgage. Keep in mind that the higher your credit score, the more likely you are to get the most competitive rate.
In addition to the principal and interest, be sure to add monthly insurance costs, taxes, and other fees, like HOA dues, that are regularly paid out of mortgage escrow.
There are other monthly expenses to account for, like homeowners insurance and property taxes. To enter these additional costs into the above mortgage calculator for New Mexico, just click ""Additional inputs"" (below ""Mortgage type"").
When you use our New Mexico mortgage calculator, remember that property taxes paid as a percentage of owner-occupied homes are on average 0.55%, but may be different in your county. Homeowners may also be part of a homeowners association (HOA) and have to pay a monthly HOA fee on top of their mortgage payment. HOA fees usually cover the maintenance of common areas, and often include services like trash pickup. You may also need to account for private mortgage insurance (PMI). Homeowners pay PMI if they don't make at least a 20% down payment on their home.
Our tool will help break down your costs so you can see what your monthly mortgage payments will look like in different scenarios. If you want to refinance an existing mortgage, our New Mexico mortgage calculator can also help you determine your monthly payment -- and you can check out our list of the best refinance lenders to get that process started.
There are also specific issues you should be aware of when buying a home in New Mexico. New Mexico has one of the most diverse landscapes in the U.S., ranging from desert to grasslands, mountains, and mesas.
Despite the 18.2% increase in median home sales prices this past year, homes in New Mexico are relatively cheap compared to homes in California and Arizona. It is important to know what you want, find the ideal location, and work with the right agents and mortgage lenders to find the best price and rates.
There are several programs available for first-time home buyers through the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority (MFA), a quasi-governmental entity that provides financing for low- and moderate-income New Mexicans. Using funding from housing bonds, tax credits, and other federal and state agencies, the MFA provides financing and resources to build affordable rental communities, rehabilitate aging homes, and supply down payment assistance, affordable mortgages, and other services to New Mexicans.
To qualify for New Mexico MFA mortgage programs, home buyers need to have a minimum credit score of 620 and receive pre-purchase home buyer counseling.
If you're buying a home in New Mexico, you'll need to bring at least a 3% down payment for a conventional mortgage or 3.5% for an FHA loan. However, there are first-time home buyer assistance programs available that can cut that figure down significantly, depending on the cost of your home and your personal financial situation. In addition, some borrowers may be eligible for 0% down loans through VA and USDA.
New Mexico home buyers can expect to pay $3,513 in closing costs on average for a home purchase, but only $2,693 if they're simply refinancing.

i = your monthly interest rate. Your lender likely lists interest rates as an annual figure, so you’ll need to divide by 12, for each month of the year. So, if your rate is 5%, then the monthly rate will look like this: 0.05/12 = 0.004167.
n = the number of payments over the life of the loan. If you take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, this means: n = 30 years x 12 months per year, or 360 payments.
Determining what your monthly house payment will be is an important part of figuring out how much house you can afford. That monthly payment is likely to be the biggest part of your cost of living.
If an ARM is a good option. Adjustable-rate mortgages start with a ""teaser"" interest rate, and then the loan rate changes — higher or lower — over time. A 5/1 ARM can be a good choice, particularly if you plan on being in a home for just a few years. You’ll want to be aware of how much your monthly mortgage payment can change when the introductory rate expires, especially if interest rates are trending higher.
If you’re buying too much home. The mortgage payment calculator can give you a reality check on how much you can expect to pay each month, especially when considering all the costs, including taxes, insurance and private mortgage insurance.
If you’re putting enough money down. With minimum down payments commonly as low as 3%, it's easier than ever to put just a little money down. The mortgage payment calculator can help you decide what the best down payment may be for you.
Mortgage lenders are required to assess your ability to repay the amount you want to borrow. A lot of factors go into that assessment, and the main one is debt-to-income ratio.
Your debt-to-income ratio is the percentage of pretax income that goes toward monthly debt payments, including the mortgage, car payments, student loans, minimum credit card payments and child support. Lenders look most favorably on debt-to-income ratios of 36% or less — or a maximum of $1,800 a month on an income of $5,000 a month before taxes.
Principal: This is the amount you borrow. Each mortgage payment reduces the principal you owe.
Interest: What the lender charges you to lend you the money. Interest rates are expressed as an annual percentage.
Property taxes: The annual tax assessed by a government authority on your home and land. You pay about one-twelfth of your annual tax bill with each mortgage payment, and the servicer saves them in an escrow account. When the taxes are due, the loan servicer pays them.
Homeowners insurance: Your policy covers damage and financial losses from fire, storms, theft, a tree falling on your house and other bad things. As with property taxes, you pay roughly one-twelfth of your annual premium each month, and the servicer pays the bill when it's due.
Mortgage insurance: If your down payment is less than 20% of the home’s purchase price, you’ll likely pay mortgage insurance. It protects the lender’s interest in case a borrower defaults on a mortgage. Once the equity in your property increases to 20%, the mortgage insurance is canceled, unless you have an FHA loan backed by the Federal Housing Administration.
Typically, when you belong to a homeowners association, the dues are billed directly, and it's not added to the monthly mortgage payment. Because HOA dues can be easy to forget, they're included in NerdWallet's mortgage calculator.
Extend the term (the number of years it will take to pay off the loan). With a longer term, your payment will be lower but you’ll pay more interest over the years. Review your amortization schedule to see the impact of extending your loan.
Buy less house. Taking out a smaller loan means a smaller monthly mortgage payment.
Avoid paying PMI. With a down payment of 20% or more, you won’t have to pay private mortgage insurance. Similarly, keeping at least 20% equity in the home lets you avoid PMI when you refinance.
Get a lower interest rate. Making a larger down payment can not only let you avoid PMI, but reduce your interest rate, too. That means a lower monthly mortgage payment.
Property taxes or homeowners insurance premiums rise. These costs are included in most mortgage payments.

New Mexico has one of the most diverse landscapes in the U.S., ranging from desert to grasslands, mountains, and mesas. Despite the 18.2% increase in median home sales prices, homes in New Mexico are relatively affordable compared to homes in California and Arizona. To find the best deals, know what you want, find the ideal location, and work with the right agents and mortgage lenders.

**First-Time Home Buyer Programs in New Mexico**

There are several programs available for first-time home buyers through the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority (MFA), a quasi-governmental entity that provides financing for low- and moderate-income New Mexicans. To qualify, home buyers need to have a minimum credit score of 620 and receive pre-purchase home buyer counseling.

**Closing Costs and Other Expenses**

New Mexico home buyers can expect to pay $3,513 in closing costs on average for a home purchase, but only $2,693 if they're refinancing. Be sure to factor these costs into your overall budget.

By understanding the New Mexico real estate market and factoring in all the expenses associated with buying a home, you can make a more informed decision and avoid any surprises along the way.","Here is the style guide in JSON format, organized into a clear hierarchy:

When you get a significant raise at work or suddenly come into a lot more money, it can be exciting. You may feel less worried about money matters if this happens. While it can be nice to reward yourself, it's easy to experience lifestyle creep. As your income rises, you may adjust your spending to meet that new financial standard. But before you realize it, you may be spending most or all of your extra income.
Lifestyle creep is when your standard of living rises as you make more money. While celebrating a new job or an income raise can be fun, you want to avoid too much lifestyle creep. You may decide to adjust your budget to buy healthier food or to get some new wardrobe items for your new work role. But you probably want to avoid upgrading all areas of your life -- because that gets expensive. For example, buying a car, going out to eat several nights a week, and treating your friends when you go out for drinks can drain your funds quickly. This can make it hard to save any of the extra money you've made.
Luckily, there are steps you can take to avoid lifestyle creep. Here are some suggestions.
Alert: highest cash back card we’ve seen now has 0% intro APR for 15 months. Learn more here.
Saving money is a great personal finance priority. Coming in to extra funds is often the perfect time to get a jump on your financial goals, like saving for emergencies, investing for the future, or putting away cash for a car or home.
When you automate your savings, there's no excuse for forgetting to save. It's easy to automate your savings weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, and you can have those funds put directly into your savings account. This can help ensure that you don't spend your money on fun stuff before prioritizing your savings goals.
You can avoid lifestyle creep by holding off on making big life changes -- like upgrading your rental to a fancy apartment, buying a pricey home, or getting a new luxury vehicle. Fight the urge to do these things soon after you start making more money. Instead, take the time to plan out any significant life changes and expensive purchases. For example, you might consider planning a big purchase at least three to six months in advance -- and evaluate whether the purchase is still worth it as time passes. Doing this also gives you more time to save up for the expense and can help ensure that you have enough extra money for your other needs, too.
If you were budgeting before your income boost, keep doing it. You may need to adjust some aspects -- like increasing your savings goals -- but don't assume that you no longer need to follow a budget just because you have more money. Set a budget and stick to your plan.
Instead of feeling the need to rush out and spend all of your newfound money, consider spending some of it to treat yourself on occasion. For example, you might do a monthly activity or buy a fun gift for yourself each quarter. This way, you can celebrate your successes and spend some of your money on yourself -- but there's less worry about going overboard and spending too much.
Consider who you're spending your time with and their impact on your finances. If you're hanging out with friends who love to spend money all the time or who have expensive tastes, that may not be the most conducive way for you to save your own hard-earned funds. It's certainly OK to be friends with people who have a higher income than you do, but make sure you're not feeling pressured to spend more or change your lifestyle habits. If you are feeling pressured, it may be a sign that it's time to socialize with different people.
By following these tips, you can keep better control over your finances and avoid lifestyle creep. Making extra money can be great, but be sure you're spending it in ways that help make your life better and support your personal goals.

The idea of anything creeping in unnoticed is enough to unnerve the bravest among us.
In the world of personal finance, it’s the subtle, sneaking changes in spending habits that may be most chilling. The phenomenon is known as lifestyle creep, and it’s one of the biggest — and most overlooked — barriers to building long-term wealth. However, once you know what to look for, there are strategies for keeping lifestyle creep far, far away.
“Folks agonize over negotiating pay or maximizing their returns by just a couple percentage points, but it's lifestyle creep that kills a lot of folks,” says Ami Shah, a certified financial planner in Washington, D.C., and CEO of Steward, a financial planning software tool.
As income rises throughout your career, often expenses will, too. More disposable income might mean signing up for another streaming service or eating out more frequently. Or, it could mean buying a second home or a new car.
And it’s here, “when your expenses continuously increase in lockstep with your income,” that lifestyle creep can set in, Nilay Gandhi, a CFP and senior wealth advisor with Vanguard, said in an email interview.
On the one hand, it’s only natural to increase your spending as your income rises. After all, we work hard to buy and do the things we love in life. It’s when that higher spending happens mindlessly, rather than intentionally, that it becomes problematic, says Mary Lyons, an investment advisor and founder of the Benchmark Income Group in Dallas.
Perhaps you’re spending more so your lifestyle can match that of your friends and family, or because you feel it’s expected of you. You may even feel that by working so hard for it, you’ve earned the right to spend more.
However, these thoughts and feelings may be signs that your higher spending is happening automatically, rather than intentionally, Lyons says.
Lifestyle creep can happen to anyone, no matter their income. Shah says that when her organization asked high earners (those with salaries of $100,000 to $500,000) to name their top financial challenge, nearly half stated an inability to save enough.
This highlights an important fact: There’s no outearning lifestyle creep.
One of the most detrimental side effects of lifestyle creep is that spending more inevitably means saving and investing less. This problem is particularly acute for younger savers, who have the most to gain from investing early.
Thanks to compounding, even small investments have the potential to grow significantly over a long enough period, said Gandhi, who's based in Malvern, Pennsylvania. But if your spending consistently increases with your income, there’s none left for investing.
For older investors planning for retirement that's about five to 10 years away, lifestyle creep brings a different danger. These savers tend to be at the peaks of their careers in terms of salaries and bonuses, and often spend more lavishly on luxury items, such as homes and cars.
However, if they’ve been earning that high salary for only a short period, their savings may not be sufficient to continue that lifestyle in retirement.
“This either forces them to work longer or cut expenses in retirement — and both options can be difficult to stomach,” Gandhi said.
Lifestyle creep can also lead to additional life stresses, Shah says. For example, if your lifestyle becomes dependent on a certain level of income, what happens if you want to switch jobs or careers?
“I’ve seen far too many people who are stuck in a job they hate because of this,” Shah says.
when you open and fund an account with Webull.
There are several ways to keep lifestyle creep at bay, but Shah, Gandhi and Lyons all agree the best place to start is to create a financial plan and a budget, and stick with both.
For Shah, the first line of defense is not overspending on housing, often someone’s highest expense. Generally, she suggests clients keep housing costs below 25% of their net income. And, if the amount they’re saving falls below 20% of their net income, that could be lifestyle creep crawling in.
Lyons suggests paying yourself a weekly allowance to remain intentional about your spending, no matter how much money you make. She recommends her clients — even those earning more than $1 million a year — set up programs to automatically pay essential expenses. And then with what’s left, they decide on an appropriate budget on a weekly cadence, rather than monthly.
“And what that does is really get rid of impulse spending,” she says.
For example, if you’re out of money on Thursday and your allowance comes on Friday, it’s easy to decide to put off a purchase. But if you have to wait two weeks for a paycheck, it’s much more tempting to charge it and pay it off later.
Earning a raise is a great opportunity to ward off lifestyle creep, Gandhi said.
He advised putting a certain percentage of the raise — 75% is a good rule of thumb, he said — into a pot that will help you meet your financial goals, whether that’s retirement, stock investing, saving for a down payment or paying off debt. Then, whatever’s left is yours to use however you want.
This, he said, is one of the best ways for anyone to set themselves up for financial success while evading the subtle-yet-destructive march of lifestyle creep.

**The Sneaky Way Higher Income Can Sabotage Your Finances**

Making more money is a great problem to have, but it can also lead to a sneaky financial foe: lifestyle creep. When your income rises, it's natural to want to celebrate and reward yourself. But if you're not careful, your spending can increase right along with your income, leaving you with little to nothing left over for savings and investments.

Lifestyle creep can happen to anyone, regardless of income level. Even high earners can find themselves struggling to save enough due to a creeping sense of entitlement to spend more. And it's not just about keeping up with the Joneses – sometimes, it's about feeling like you've earned the right to splurge after working hard for your money.

But here's the thing: there's no outearning lifestyle creep. If you're not intentional about your spending, you'll find yourself perpetually playing catch-up, with little to show for it in terms of long-term wealth.

**The Consequences of Lifestyle Creep**

Lifestyle creep can have serious consequences, particularly for younger savers who have the most to gain from investing early. When you spend more, you inevitably save and invest less. And with compounding on the line, even small investments can make a big difference over time.

For older investors nearing retirement, lifestyle creep can be especially problematic. If you're used to earning a high income and spending lavishly, you may find yourself struggling to maintain that lifestyle in retirement – which can force you to work longer or cut expenses, neither of which is ideal.

**Breaking the Cycle of Lifestyle Creep**

So, how do you avoid falling prey to lifestyle creep? It starts with creating a financial plan and sticking to it. Here are some strategies to keep in mind:

* **Don't overspend on housing**: Keep housing costs below 25% of your net income to avoid sacrificing too much of your hard-earned cash.
* **Pay yourself a weekly allowance**: Set up automatic transfers to cover essential expenses, and then use what's left to budget intentionally.
* **Allocate your raise wisely**: When you get a raise, put at least 75% of it towards your financial goals, and use the rest to treat yourself.

By following these tips, you can avoid the subtle-yet-destructive march of lifestyle creep and set yourself up for long-term financial success. Remember, making more money is just the beginning – it's what you do with it that really matters.

Making Extra Money? Avoid Lifestyle Creep and Stay on Top of Your Finances

Getting a significant raise or coming into a lot of money can be exciting, but it can also lead to lifestyle creep. If you're not careful, you might find yourself spending most or all of your extra income on upgrades and luxuries. This can make it hard to save any of the extra money you've made.

Lifestyle creep happens when your standard of living rises as your income increases. While it's okay to celebrate your success and treat yourself occasionally, you want to avoid making unnecessary purchases that can drain your funds quickly.

Instead, focus on making smart money moves. Here are some tips to help you avoid lifestyle creep and stay on top of your finances:

**Automate Your Savings**

Coming into extra funds is a great opportunity to get ahead on your financial goals. Consider automating your savings to ensure that you don't spend your money on impulse purchases before prioritizing your savings goals. You can set up weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly transfers to your savings account.

**Avoid Big Life Changes**

Avoid making big life changes, such as upgrading to a fancy apartment or buying a luxury car, soon after you start making more money. Take the time to plan out your purchases and evaluate whether they're worth the expense. This can help you avoid overspending and ensure that you have enough money for your other needs.

**Stick to Your Budget**

Just because you're making more money doesn't mean you can ditch your budget. In fact, you may need to adjust your budget to include new savings goals or expenses. Sticking to your budget can help you stay on track and avoid overspending.

**Spend Wisely**

Reward yourself occasionally, but do it wisely. Consider setting aside a small amount of money each month or quarter to treat yourself. This can help you avoid overspending and stay focused on your financial goals.

**Be Mindful of Your Social Circle**

The people you surround yourself with can influence your spending habits. If you're hanging out with friends who love to spend money, it may be harder to stay on track with your financial goals. Consider socializing with people who share your financial values.

By following these tips, you can avoid lifestyle creep and stay on top of your finances. Remember, making extra money is a great opportunity to get ahead, but it's only worth it if you use it wisely.

Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's fiscal full year and Q4 2022 earnings results conference call. [Operator instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to senior vice president of investor relations for The Walt Disney Company, Alexia Quadrani. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website.
Joining me for today's call are Bob Chapek, Disney's chief executive officer; and Christine McCarthy, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Walt Disney wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
Thank you, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal 2022 was a strong year for our company as we continued our journey of telling incredible Disney stories, utilizing groundbreaking technology in order to further develop our brands and franchises while customizing and personalizing experiences to make magical memories that last a lifetime. Those efforts resulted in truly phenomenal storytelling, record annual results at our parks, experiences, and products segment, and outstanding growth at our direct-to-consumer services, which added nearly 57 million subscriptions this year to reach a total of more than 235 million. We are particularly pleased with growth in the fourth quarter, which saw the addition of 14.6 million subscriptions across our suite of services, including 12 million Disney+ subscriptions, over 9 million of which were Core Disney+.
It has taken just three short years for Disney+ to transform from a nascent business to an industry leader. That transformation is the direct result of the strategic decision we made at launch to heavily invest in our direct-to-consumer offering, a decision made knowing that achieving rapid growth would result in short-term losses. Building a streaming powerhouse has required significant investment. And now, with scale, incredible content pipeline, and global reach, Disney+ is well-situated to leverage our position for long-term profitability and success.
Our financial results this quarter represent a turning point as we reached peak DTC operating losses, which we expect to decline going forward. That expectation is based on three factors: first, the benefit of both price increases and the launch of the Disney+ ad tier next month; second, a realignment of our cost, including meaningful rationalization of our marketing spend; and third, leveraging our learnings and experience in direct-to-consumer to optimize our content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases that efficiently drive engagement and subscriber acquisition. With these factors, we believe we are on a path to profitable streaming business that generates shareholder value long into the future. And assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate, we still expect Disney+ to achieve profitability in fiscal 2024, as losses begin to shrink in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
Christine will go into more detail on the drivers of our direct-to-consumer operating performance and provide more insight into our expectations going forward and some of our key assumptions. But first, I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter. Q4 was another strong period for parks, experiences, and products, which continue to deliver phenomenal results despite the impact of Hurricane Ian. I want to thank the amazing cast members in Orlando who went above and beyond to help keep our guests safe and entertained during the storm.
From protecting the many animals at Disney Animal Kingdom, to packing thousands of meal kits, to donating and delivering emergency supplies to the community, I am so proud of how our team came together to support our guests, our neighbors, and each other. Our parks team is laser-focused on enhancing the guest experience and creating those magical memories I mentioned at the outset. This focus, along with the investments we made to bringing new attractions and experiences to our domestic parks, is generating consistently strong demand, which, on many days, exceeds our current capacity. And we continue to manage attendance levels with a focus on providing guests with the highest quality experience and enhancing our park's overall financial performance.
One of the things that guests loved most is the opportunity to celebrate at our parks as evidenced by the post-pandemic return and sell-out of special ticketed events like Oogie Boogie Bash and Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party. I visited Disneyland with my family just before Halloween, and the celebration was phenomenal. Tickets for Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party at Walt Disney World have now officially gone on sale, and over half of all dates have already sold out. As you know, we are about to embark on the company's 100th anniversary celebration.
The fun kicks off in our parks on January 27th at Disneyland, where we'll unveil new platinum-infused decor, premier two all-new nighttime spectaculars, and open the highly anticipated Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway attraction. This is only one part of what will be the largest cross-country celebration at Disney's history with activations around the world. And we're so excited for fans and families to join us. At our international parks, Disneyland Paris is enjoying a great resurgence.
Our fantastic new Marvel Avengers Campus opened on July 20th, and guests love the highly immersive and dynamic environment of the first ever Marvel-themed land in Europe. Prior to the recent closure of Shanghai Disney Resort, we are seeing positive momentum there and at Hong Kong Disneyland. We are hopeful that the situation will improve and are thinking of all of our employees there as we manage through the challenging COVID environment. Our Disney Cruise Line is showing strong signs of recovery.
The new Disney Wish is in high demand, and we've seen a ramp-up in bookings for our base fleet. This quarter was also exceptionally strong in terms of creative excellence across our content engines. Our teams received 57 Emmy Awards, spread across a remarkable 37 different titles, emanating from a wide range of brands, franchises, and distribution channels. ABC ended the season as No.
1 in entertainment programing for the third consecutive year, and ABC News continues to be the most trusted source of news with No. 1 positions across all dayparts. Theatrically, ""Thor: Love and Thunder,"" the characters for a stand-alone film, earned over $760 million worldwide. This is our first time we released a fourth film based on a single Marvel character, and Thor's longevity is a great sign for Marvel and our ability to tell stories based on its characters long into the future.
The fourth quarter was also the first time in Disney history that we released tentpole original content from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and National Geographic, an indication that we are now a full cadence of new releases as we hit our steady state. As evidenced, ""Hocus Pocus 2"" was a smash hit, becoming not only the most watched premiere on Disney+, but also a Nielsen record-setting streaming movie with 2.7 billion minutes viewed in its first weekend. And Marvel Studios' ""Ms. Marvel"" completed its run in July, and ""She-Hulk: Attorney at Law"" debuted in August, contributing to subscriber growth and driving substantial engagement.
Lucasfilm's ""Andor,"" a spy thriller that explores the backstory of Cassian Andor, a popular character from ""Rogue One,"" earned rave reviews and showcases our ability to extend stories from the big screen to our streaming services. Turning to general entertainment, the critically acclaimed ""Prey"" from 20th Century Studios was Hulu's biggest premiere ever across all films and series, and was the most watched film premiere on Star+ in Latin America and Disney+ under the Star banner in all other territories. Looking ahead, we are thrilled that audiences are returning to the box office for blockbuster films, and we have big plans for the big screen in the fiscal year 2023. ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" opens this Friday, and Ryan Coogler has delivered yet another culture-defining powerful film.
The reaction to this film's premiere a few weeks ago was incredible. And fan anticipation is very high, as indicated by the strength of attendance ticket sales. Up next is ""Strange World"" from Walt Disney Animation Studios, which opens in theaters this Thanksgiving. The highly anticipated ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" opens on December 16th and is the sequel to the highest grossing film of all time.
James Cameron and his team have once again created something truly magical using groundbreaking technology. Audiences are as excited as we are to return to Pandora. And given the strong performance of September's rerelease of the original ""Avatar,"" we can't wait for the film to hit screens. Our Searchlight studio continues to deliver critically acclaimed films, and three fantastic titles will be in theaters this quarter: ""The Banshees of Inisherin"", which has earned critical acclaim since its Venice premiere; ""The Menu"" starring Ray Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy; and the ""Empire of Light"" from Academy Award winner, Sam Mendes.
Looking even further into 2023, we'll see theatrical releases of three highly anticipated Marvel films, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,"" ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,"" and ""The Marvels."" And we could not be more excited about Disney's live actions ""The Little Mermaid,"" a reimagining of one of the most popular animated films of all time, starring Halle Bailey, whose rendition of ""Part of Your World"" has already lit up the internet. We're also bringing 999 happy haunts to life with the hilarious new live action ""Haunted Mansion"" featuring an all-star cast. Pixar will debut an all-new original feature, ""Elemental."" And Harrison Ford is back in the eagerly awaited fifth ""Indiana Jones"" film, which is going to be spectacular.
Of course, all of our theatrical titles will eventually make their way onto our streaming platforms, complementing our robust slate of original content. ""Zootopia+,"" a new series from Disney Animation, debuts tomorrow, along with ""Save Our Squad,"" an original series from the U.K. that sees soccer superstar, David Beckham, return home to mentor a grassroots team of young boys struggling to survive in their league. On November 18th, Disney+ will release ""Disenchanted"" based on the successful ""Enchanted"" that came out 15 years ago.
Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special"" will follow right after. And ""Willow,"" another long awaited sequel from Lucasfilm, will premiere the following week. We are so fortunate to have an abundance of content from all of our creative engines paired with a wealth of knowledge and insight into what resonates with our fans. As we move forward, we will increasingly leverage that knowledge to refine our distribution decisions in order to best serve our audience and maximize the return on our content investments.
Turning to sports, ESPN was the No. 1 cable network in total day and prime viewing among audiences aged 18 to 49 in Q4. And the Walt Disney Company was responsible for 40% of sports hours watched among that age bracket, the biggest share of any family of networks. ESPN continues to lead with its multi-platform sports ecosystem, with reach across linear, streaming, digital, and social media, serving fans at massive scale, with the power and support of the Walt Disney Company behind it.
ESPN is an unequaled reach machine. And the business is well-positioned through our strategic portfolio of long-term rights agreements, with an eye to remaining disciplined in our approach. We recently announced an extension with Formula 1 through 2025, which is one of the fastest growing sports properties and is on pace to surpass last year's record audience on ESPN. The 2022 college football season is off to its best nine-week start in five years across our networks.
And thanks to our incoming SEC agreement in 2024, we will remain the leading college football platform with over 60% of the college football market. And our new long-term NFL agreement includes Super Bowls, an annual ESPN+ exclusive match up and more regular season and playoff games and better scheduling. On October 30th, we marked another milestone moment in our DTC streaming services and the growth of ESPN+, when the Broncos versus Jaguars NFL game from London became our most viewed ESPN+ event ever. Finally, we are exactly one month from the U.S.
launch of Disney+'s ad-supported subscription offering, which is a win for audiences, advertisers, and shareholders. The launch will bring fans a new slate of subscription plans across Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, and the Disney Bundle, getting viewers flexibility in choosing an option that suits their needs. The offering also adds a key component to our total company advertising portfolio, and advertiser interest has been strong. We have been a leader in streaming advertising for some time and are bringing our years of experience leading ad tech and relationships to this important opportunity.
Disney+ has secured more than 100 advertisers for our domestic launch window, spanning a wide range of categories. And our company has over 8,000 existing relationships with advertisers who will have the opportunity to advertise on Disney+. Strong base pricing reflects the value advertisers put on our audience, our brand-safe environment for their messages, and our sales experience. We also have proven technology to deliver a great advertising experience on day one.
And importantly, we have the ability to scale and innovate for audiences and advertisers alike. We are incredibly excited about the launch of our new ad-supported subscription offering for Disney+, which rolls out on December 8th. 2022 was an important year of recovery coming out of the pandemic, as we made foundational investments in our long-term success. As we celebrate the three-year anniversary of Disney+ this week, I can't help but reflect upon how our commitment to and substantial investment in our DTC business has helped create the world's most powerful suite of streaming services with the ability to reach hundreds of millions of viewers around the world with must see content, services which aren't just content delivery systems but platforms that bring us closer to audiences than ever before and enable consumers to access more of The Walt Disney Company's total offering.
With our unmatched brands and franchises, robust pipeline of content capable of filling all of our distribution channels, unique experiences, and strong connections to audiences around the world, I believe we are well-positioned for future long-term growth, and I'm confident in the path forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Christine to talk in greater detail about our quarter and the year ahead.
Good afternoon, everyone. We have wrapped up another dynamic fiscal year. And as we enter into fiscal 2023, I will be diving a bit deeper than usual today into the results of our businesses, and we'll give some additional color on where we expect to go from here, especially given the inflection point that we believe we have now reached in our direct-to-consumer business. Excluding certain items, our company's diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.30.
And for the full fiscal 2022 year, diluted EPS, excluding certain items, was $3.53. Our parks, experiences, and products segment had another stellar quarter, with DPEP operating income in the fourth quarter more than doubling versus the prior year to $1.5 billion. Our domestic parks delivered significant year-over-year revenue and operating income growth despite an adverse impact of approximately $65 million to segment operating income from Hurricane Ian. And per-capita spending remained strong, increasing 6% versus Q4 of fiscal 2021 and nearly 40% versus fiscal 2019, reflecting the continued popularity of premium offerings, including Genie+ and Lightning Lane.
We are also making meaningful progress on the return of international visitors to our domestic parks, particularly at Walt Disney World, where the mix of international attendance in the fourth quarter was roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels. Looking toward fiscal 2023, while we continue to monitor our booking trends for any macroeconomic impacts, we are still seeing robust demand at our domestic parks and are anticipating a strong holiday season in Q1. Disney Cruise Line was also a meaningful contributor to the year-over-year increase in domestic parks and experiences' operating income in Q4, reflecting the successful launch of the Disney Wish in July and continued recovery of the existing fleet coming out of the pandemic. Order to date, occupancy for the Wish continues to exceed 90%, while we have also seen a meaningful pickup in the rest of our fleet with booked revenue up versus pre-pandemic levels.
At international parks, fourth quarter results also improved significantly year over year, driven by continued strength at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a decrease at Shanghai Disney Resort. As Bob mentioned, the situation in Shanghai has recently been challenging. The park is currently closed, and we do not yet have visibility to a reopening date. Q4 results at consumer products also increased versus the prior year, driven by higher merchandise licensing results across several of our key franchises, including Mickey and Friends, Encanto, and Toy Story.
Moving on to media and entertainment distribution. Operating income in the fourth quarter decreased by $864 million versus the prior year as a modest increase at Linear Networks was more than offset by wider losses at direct-to-consumer and, to a lesser extent, at content sales, licensing, and other. At Linear Networks, operating income in the fourth quarter increased 6% to $1.7 billion, driven primarily by growth at domestic channels. The increase at domestic channels primarily reflects higher results of cable, driven by lower programing and production costs, partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenue.
Compared to the prior-year fourth quarter, cable programing and production costs benefited from the timing of the NBA Finals, which were in Q4 of fiscal 2021 versus Q3 of fiscal 2022, as well as from lower costs for Major League Baseball programing due to fewer games under our new contract. These impacts were partially offset by higher NFL programing costs as a result of one additional game aired versus the prior year quarter. The decrease in cable advertising revenue versus the prior-year fourth quarter also reflects a timing impact of the NBA Finals. ESPN advertising revenue in Q4 was down 23% year over year.
However, adjusting for the timing impact of the NBA finals, it was down roughly 2%. Note that in Q1 of fiscal 2023, we also expect to see a timing impact versus the prior year from two college football playoff games that are shifting into the second fiscal quarter this year versus the first quarter last year. Order to date, ESPN domestic cash advertising sales are pacing down, reflecting, in part, the absence of these two CFP games. The advertising landscape remains fluid.
The sports marketplace, in particular, is delivering strong audiences across our platforms, with marketers looking to take advantage of live events and several categories, including political, pharma, insurance, and restaurants, have continued to show relatively stable demand, while others remain cautious in anticipation of potential economic softness. Total domestic affiliate revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 2% from the prior year, driven by 5 points of growth from contractual rate increases, partially offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Looking ahead, we expect to see Linear subscriber declines accelerate more, in line with industry trends. International channels' operating income decreased by $25 million in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, reflecting lower results from our ongoing channels and operation, partially offset by a benefit from channel closures.
At content sales, licensing, and other, results decreased versus the prior year by a little over $100 million, in line with guidance, due to lower TV/SVOD and home entertainment results, partially offset by higher theatrical results and an increase at our stage play business. While difficult comparisons may persist in the intermediate term at our TV/SVOD and home entertainment businesses, results will vary quarter to quarter. And we currently expect content sales, licensing, and other operating results to improve slightly in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Finally, I'd like to spend some time talking about our fourth quarter results at direct-to-consumer, where our losses peaked in the fourth quarter at approximately $1.5 billion.
Hulu and ESPN+ added approximately 1 million and 1.5 million subscribers, respectively, during the quarter, while Disney+ added over 12 million global subscribers, of which a little less than 3 million were at Disney+ Hotstar. Core Disney+ added over 9 million subs in Q4, accelerating as expected versus the 6 million net ads we saw in the third quarter, reflecting the success of Disney+ Day and our tentpole content releases, in addition to continued growth from third quarter market launches. Nearly 2 million of these net ads were from the U.S. and Canada, and a little over 7 million were international Core editions.
At the same time, Core Disney+ ARPU decreased by 5% between Q3 and Q4, reflecting an adverse foreign exchange impact and, to a lesser extent, a slightly higher mix of subscribers from lower-priced international markets. ARPU at each streaming service is also impacted by the mix of subscribers to the bundle. Our bundled and multi-product offerings now account for over 40% of our fiscal year-end domestic Disney+ subscriber count. This shift has been purposeful as the bundle drives higher total company subscription revenue and higher long-term subscriber value due to notably lower churn.
Lower pay-per-view revenue at ESPN+ and slightly lower advertising revenue at Hulu and Disney+ Hotstar also impacted direct-to-consumer revenue in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. With our expectation that peak losses are now behind us, DTC operating results should improve going forward as we lay the foundation for a sustainably profitable business model. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect direct to consumer operating results to improve by at least $200 million versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, with larger improvement expected in Q2, reflecting a couple of key factors. First, our recently announced price increases across our direct-to-consumer offerings in the US should begin to modestly benefit ARPU and subscription revenue in the first quarter.
However, given that the Disney+ price increase will not go into effect until toward the end of Q1, this benefit will be realized more fully in the second quarter. Similarly, we do not expect the launch of the advertising-supported tier of Disney+ in December to provide a more meaningful financial impact until later this fiscal year. Additionally, our commitment to cost rationalization will allow us to scale effectively against our investments. In particular, while DTC programing and production costs will increase from Q4 to Q1 over the course of the year, content expense and opex growth should slow as we approach steady state.
And marketing costs should decline, as we continue to focus on aligning our costs with our dynamic business models. As it relates to subscribers, we expect ESPN+ and Hulu will continue to add new subscribers in Q1. And we expect Core Disney+ subscribers to increase only slightly in the quarter, reflecting tougher comparisons against Disney+ Day performance. As we've mentioned before, subscriber growth will not be linear each and every quarter, and the trend is driven by several factors, including content releases and promotions.
We expect Disney+ Core subscriber growth to then accelerate in the fiscal second quarter, largely driven by international markets. And at Disney+ Hotstar, we are currently expecting that subscribers will decline in Q1 due to the absence of the IPL, but we do expect to see some stabilization in Q2. I'll note that our direct-to-consumer expectations are built on certain assumptions around subscriber additions based on the attractiveness of our future content, current expectations for upcoming price increases, the financial impact of the Disney+ ad tier and price increases, and our ability to quickly execute on cost rationalization while preserving revenue. All of which while based on extensive internal analysis, as well as recent experience, provides a layer of uncertainty in our outlook.
Before we conclude, there are a couple of other items I would like to mention around our fiscal 2023 expectations. Cash content spend totaled $30 billion in fiscal 2022, and we continue to expect it to be in the low $30 billion range for fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures totaled nearly $5 billion in fiscal 2022, in line with our expectations. And we currently expect that capex will increase in fiscal 2023 to a total of $6.7 billion, driven by higher spend across the enterprise.
Putting this all together, assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the macroeconomic climate, we currently expect total company fiscal 2023 revenue and segment operating income to both grow at a high single digit percentage rate versus fiscal 2022. We are confident about the opportunities we see to continue to transform our business for the next 100 years and look forward to sharing our progress with you all throughout 2023. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.
Thanks, Christine. As we transition to Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many analysts as possible today. And with that, operator, we're ready for your first question.
[Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Thanks. Good morning -- or good afternoon, sorry. Two questions. Bob, you talked a little bit about how -- what's the consumer experience going to be like as you roll out this price increase here in a month? You've got -- you've got customers on lots of different plans, different distributors.
Can you talk a little bit about your confidence that it's going to be seamless and that consumers will have the ability to choose the plan that works best for them? And then, Christine, on the parks margins, U.S. margins this quarter, I think through the first three quarters of fiscal '22, margins were up pretty nicely versus '19. And they were actually down, I think, this quarter. It didn't sound like there was anything in your prepared remarks that sort of commented on that.
There was a mention of cost inflation in the release. But I just wonder if you could spend a little bit of time talking about some of the cost drivers in the U.S. parks business in the quarter. Anything unusual that you would want to call out and how we might want to think about that heading into '23.
All right. Thank you, Ben. In terms of, you know, trying to communicate to consumers the multitude of options we're getting them, we believe that more choice is actually good. And you're right, it's predicated upon our ability to communicate the options to the consumer.
But we've got so many years of history with Hulu, where we've given them options between advertising and nonadvertising, Hulu plus Live TV, without Hulu plus Live TV, that we believe that we've got a pretty good formula for how we could communicate. And that formula has worked very well domestically. And so, we believe it'll work as well internationally, as well as across both Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+. I think it's important to keep in mind that, you know, we've got unmatched brands.
And as we continue to go ahead and, you know, extend our reach, and there are different business models, different pricing models for consumers, that that choice itself will really enable us to have maximum penetration regardless of the brand under which the option is given to consumers. But also, at the same time, as our platforms become just that more and more platforms and less and less just distribution options, we've got a pretty good formula, I think, for making that simple for the consumer, but also enabling for the consumer to go ahead and subscribe in a way that suits them best.
OK, Ben, on your question about the parks margins, so DPEP's segment margin came in around 20.4% for this quarter, and that is lower than previous quarters this year. Let's remember that Q4 is historically the lowest quarter of the year for margins. And there's two things going on here, both on the revenue and the expense side. On the revenue side, it is primarily driven by traditional seasonality, you know, back-to-school time, and, to a lesser extent, as I called out in my comments, the impact of Hurricane Ian, that was a $65 million drag on the quarter.
We have been using 2019 as our base for comparison, you know, pre-pandemic. So, when you compare it to fiscal '19 Q4, the lower margin is driven by international parks performance. And then if you flip to the expense side, the increase in quarter-over-quarter expenses is the continued effect of bringing on some more guest offerings. Those are things like nighttime spectaculars.
We also have park ticket events. And they have a lot of cost, you know, just in terms of setup and breakdown. We also, remember, have a new ship, the Wish, that just started operations. And there's some other smaller one-time items.
But those are the real drivers of that lower margin this quarter.
All right. Thank you. Next question.
Our next question comes from Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Hi. Thank you. Turning to DTC, I guess let's focus on the profit in '24 guidance. You know, we've talked in the past that this means probably a quarter or two in '24 and not for the full year.
Is that still the way to think about it? And I did notice the comment about, you know, assuming the economy maybe doesn't get worse or something like that, can you just talk about what drove you to add that language?
I'll take that, Phil. So, direct-to-consumer for '24 profitability, you should be thinking about it as a quarter, not a year basis. And then, on some of the profitability drivers that we talked about that I think answered the question about the economy, you know, we do have things like the steady state of content on the service. That's independent of the economy.
We are focusing on bundled offerings as we refine our value proposition. There's also increasing international core market penetration. Once again, that is somewhat reliant on a stable economy. And increasing ARPU through the pricing increases would also, I think, be something that could be sensitive to the economic environment.
We do have the Disney+ ad tier launch and ad monetization growth. And the indications that we have so far is that those are very strong. So, we really are looking at, you know, sort of the puts and takes on what's going to be economically sensitive. But we just think, in an abundance of caution, we really have to keep the health of the consumer in mind when we think about achieving all of our goals this upcoming year.
Thank you. I do have a follow-up.
I was going to say, you called out a few -- both you and Bob called out G&A and marketing savings on the call. How is Disney thinking about just cost in general? Is there a process going on today to cut costs across the board? And what might the timing of that be? Thanks again.
Yeah, Thanks for that question and follow-up, Phil. We are actively evaluating our cost base currently, and we're looking for meaningful efficiencies. Some of those are going to provide some near-term savings, and others are going to drive longer-term structural benefits. You know, I just would point to what we did in the parks during the pandemic.
We did some structural changes, and the parks is better off because of that. But those were structural benefits that did not flow back into their cost base. We will update you with more information as our plan evolves.
Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.
Thanks. I have two. One is on the parks in '23, I was trying to understand, what levers can you pull, do you think? If there is a slowing U.S. consumer, what can you do to kind of maintain the revenue growth? I guess the revenue that we've seen.
So, in other words, what can be different this time versus previous downturns? And then, Christine, I just have to come back to that operating profit guide, which you never give. So, I appreciate the fact that you did it. I'm just trying to get the piece parts right. You know, DTC is going to get better.
Parks is showing a weakness. But can you hone in a bit on the outlook for the rest of DMED in '23? Is that what you see is kind of, you know, the slower OI growth next year? Thanks.
So, you're talking about parks, Michael. What is different is, compared to the last time we had a slowdown in the economy for managing our parks business, we have more commercial tools and levers available to us. One of the ones that's quite obvious is discounting. That's something that we have used in the past, and we will continue to use it because it is an effective lever for managing your yield.
But we're not going to use it to the extent to which we used it during the last recession. Some of the other things that are new would be the reservation system. So, you know, we manage attendance now. We can track it real time.
On many days, we are fully booked now. But we can adjust that and be very flexible in real time on adjusting it, if we if we so choose. The other thing is we have a tiered pricing structure that gives us a lot of flexibility. And we also have reimagined our annual pass business model.
And we could also have some more flexibility in using our annual pass program. We also have technology advancements, and this is more on the expense side. That provides us opportunities for cost flexibility. So, we have things like mobile ordering, contactless check-in.
So, those kinds of things give us levers on the expense side. But we do feel that we have -- you know, once again, hearkening back to the opportunity we took during the pandemic, we did permanently remove a significant amount of operating expense at the parks. And that better positions us right now as we go into an uncertain economic environment.
Michael, do you have a second question?
Well, it was on the OI guide, right, which you don't usually give. So, trying to dig into the DMED outlook, given what you said about the other businesses at this point.
Yeah, we gave the outlook that was more for the company as a whole. But, you know, we're still looking at DPEP being a strong -- continuing its strong growth. DMED, we're looking at it in three components, the direct-to-consumer. We're looking at improving profitability as we've mentioned.
We believe that this quarter that we're reporting is the low point, and it will improve from here. CLS&O that will have some challenges, as we said. So, that'll be variable quarter to quarter. And then, we have to look at our linear business.
And we do have some declines that are in line with the industry, and that's one that is just an industry issue that we're all going to be managing through.
All right. Thank you. Next question.
Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Thank you. Maybe, I guess, you know, if you look at the streaming business as a whole and if you step back and look at the strategy going forward, we'll see a price increase next quarter. And of course, that is also the ad-supported tier that could help manage some of the churn. But as an offset, it seems like some of the marketing expense will be optimized along with some content spending.
So, you know, Bob, if we look at the guidance right now, your subscriber growth needs to accelerate going forward in order to get to the guidance. But a lot of the levers, like pricing, may actually force churn to be higher and marketing cost may actually trend a little but lower. So, when we think about this, how do we reconcile the subscriber guidance with the financial model of the business? And does it make sense to maybe, you know, focus more on profitability rather than some growth from our perspective going forward?
Our approach going forward is going to be focused largely on profitability, keeping in mind, though, that the revenue growth that we have is also going to be a key component toward the overall profitability. If we look at the content that's going to actually fuel our subscriber growth and our engagement, we're obviously managing that very carefully. Christine talked about some cost management initiatives that's not only across marketing, but also on the content spending itself as well. But we've also got an opportunity, I believe, to manage our profitability through that pricing power that we believe we have here.
We launched these services at tremendous values to the consumer. And everything that we've got shows us that we still have some opportunity for continued price value exploration on all of our services. So, we believe that. And our history shows that when we've taken price increases across our streaming businesses, that we don't meaningfully increase churn or cancellations.
So, we believe we've still got some headroom there. So, whether it's cost management or attention to revenue growth through sub ad, through our great content additions or through ARPU, we believe that we've got a formula that gives us great confidence that we're going to achieve the guidance that we communicated.
Great. Thank you. Next question, please.
Our next question comes from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
Thanks. So, Bob, I think you called ESPN a rich machine, and Christine talked about the cord cutting and how that's something that everybody's going to be managing through. So, as you look to expand the reach of ESPN, I know we've had this question before, but how do you think about starting to make a lot of the marquee streaming rights -- or sorry, marquee sports rights also available on the streaming services, whether that's ESPN+ or others? And how do you think about monetizing in a streaming world with a lot more of those expensive rights available? And then, Christine, just on the capex, it's moving up, you know, a 1.5 billion or so this year. I know some of that is maybe a shift of about 500 million from last year, but it's still a little more elevated than history.
You said it was enterprisewide. So, I'm wondering if the increase is more capital projects on the parks side, or if it's other things like technology or studio expansions. Thank you.
OK. In terms of ESPN growth, I think we all have to keep in mind that, number one, ESPN is that powerhouse brand. And we certainly, over time, have been able to enjoy the benefits of that brand in a linear world. However, going forward, we've got the ability not only to continue to enjoy those benefits in a linear world, but also begin to grow our opportunities in the digital realm and leverage that brand's growth into other avenues that, heretofore, we've not been able to necessarily tap into.
I think it's also important to look at ESPN in terms of an important part of the overall Disney portfolio or synergy. It is an integral part of the bundle itself. So, when you take the fact that it's a great brand, we have the opportunity to grow it into different avenues. And as I've said before, sort of put one foot on the dock, one foot on the boat, and be flexible in terms of our speed of evolution.
I think it's going to be an important part of our business going forward. Live advertising continues to be a really important benefit that we sell into our advertising community. We've got multiple platforms, and I believe that it's going to be a very robust part of our company going forward, whether or not it's linear or whether it's digital, or somewhere in between.
So, on capex, Steve, yes, you're right. It is up. That was in my comments, As you -- for those who have followed the company for a while, we usually give you a capex number for the beginning of the year. And by the end of the year, we haven't spent it all.
So, there is some slippage that goes from one year into the next. And also, just with supply chain and labor shortages in various parts of the world, where we are having projects, that slippage is probably a little more amplified. We do have some technology spend both at the enterprise level, as well as in DMED. Some of it is consumer-facing.
Some of it is more internal to, once again, deliver longer-term efficiencies. And we have DPEP projects pretty much everywhere around the globe. So, we're continuing to build out those projects either on schedule or with some slippage that is slipping into 23.
All right. Thank you. Operator, I think we have time for one more question.
And our next question comes from Michael Morris from Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question.
Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon, guys. Two for me. One, Christina, I'm hoping you can give us a little more detail on the sequential revenue decline at the D-to-C segment.
You talked about foreign exchange. Could you quantify how much of it came from foreign exchange? Because as I'm looking at, you know, ARPUs the AAP, who's on the domestic business, domestic Disney+, in particular, they have sequentially come in as well. So, maybe how much was FX, and a little bit more detail on kind of at the core, you know, what's driving that Disney+ ARPU compression. My second question is on sports rights.
There was an article out today about Netflix potentially looking at some sports rights. Amazon seems to have had success with their Thursday night football package. So, Bob, I'm curious how you see the landscape changing as these new entrants come in, if you see it changing at all and how it impacts the environment. Thank you.
Well, I'll take the first one, Mike, on the revenue decline. So, there are a couple of things. One is that on the ARPU, the impact of foreign exchange on ARPU was about half of the decline. And we do hedge, and we have very successfully managed through this year a strong dollar for the most part.
However, as you know, we are in markets all over the globe. And some of the markets in which we have launched, their currency. We do not hedge for either extraordinarily high costs or illiquidity. So, that foreign exchange impact is about half of the impact.
The other one is lower pay per view. And this was at ESPN+, you know, we have UFC, but we had a different game set of different match schedules. You can tell I'm not a UFC fan when I call them games, but a different match schedule and the omission of a key personality in McGregor. So, that actually were the two primary factors lowering that year-over-year revenue.
Bob, you want to take the second one?
OK. Yeah. In terms of the sort of, is the landscape changing with new entrants, you know, we really like our strong position that we've got going forward, not only in terms of the breadth of the sports that we're engaged in, but also the terms of the deals that we have. So, you know, we've exercised with discipline.
I think the college conferences, in terms of our negotiation, making sure that, you know, we recognize that we don't need everything. We just need the right things. But also making sure that, you know, as we go forward, we're looking at multi-platform rights. We will not do deals where we don't get multi-platform rights that give us that very flexibility that we talked about, toggling between sort of the more linear, traditional legacy distribution channels, and that of the more, you know, digital of forward-looking platforms.
The big one that's coming up, obviously, for us would be the NBA. We'd love to be in business with the NBA. But again, we're going to do it in a fiscally responsible way and seeking multi-platform rights. So, we feel really good about our position going forward with the rights that we've already gotten and the one or two that are still in play.
I think with that, we conclude the call. I think we are out of time.
And, ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.
OK. Thanks. Note that -- I have to read a statement here for those of you who are still on. Note that the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that were referred to on this call to equivalent GAAP measures can be found in our investor relations website.

The Walt Disney Company's Fiscal Q4 2022 Earnings Results: A Mixed Bag

The Walt Disney Company (DIS) recently reported its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year earnings for 2022, and the results were a mixed bag. While the company's revenue rose 9% to $20.15 billion, its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at 30 cents, below the average estimate of 57 cents among analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha.

The earnings shortfall was primarily due to a wider loss at the Disney+ streaming service, which drove higher spending on original and licensed content. Losses at Disney's direct-to-consumer segment more than doubled year-over-year to $1.5 billion, despite a 39% year-over-year growth in worldwide Disney+ subscriptions to 164.2 million.

The Disney+ service's profitability is expected to benefit from a price increase set to take effect on December 8, along with the introduction of advertising for the lowest-cost subscriptions. The monthly cost of ad-free viewing is set to rise by $3 to $10.99, while the new service tier featuring ads will cost $7.99 monthly.

However, revenue per domestic Disney+ subscriber fell 10% year-over-year, partly due to the lack of premium pay-per-view movie offerings such as Jungle Cruise and Black Widow in the latest quarter.

On the bright side, Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products met high expectations, with all of the company's travel businesses fully operational again during the period, thanks to the lifting of COVID-19 travel restrictions outside of China.

The company's TV networks, including ESPN and ABC, saw revenue decline 5% year-over-year amid continued cord-cutting by cable subscribers, but delivered a 6% boost in operating income.

Looking ahead, Disney's Chief Financial Officer, Christine McCarthy, expects to see linear (TV) subscriber declines to accelerate more in line with industry trends.

The losses at Disney+ and to a lesser extent Hulu caused operating income at the company's Media and Entertainment Distribution segment to plummet 91% year-over-year to just $83 million.

In conclusion, while Disney's fiscal Q4 2022 earnings results were a mixed bag, the company's efforts to improve the profitability of its Disney+ service and its focus on its Parks and Experiences segment are likely to drive growth in the future.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Investopedia:

**The Walt Disney Company's Fiscal Full Year and Q4 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call**

Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's fiscal full year and Q4 2022 earnings results conference call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website.

Joining me for today's call are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions.

**Fiscal 2022: A Strong Year for Disney**

Fiscal 2022 was a strong year for our company as we continued our journey of telling incredible Disney stories, utilizing groundbreaking technology to further develop our brands and franchises, and customizing and personalizing experiences to make magical memories that last a lifetime. Those efforts resulted in truly phenomenal storytelling, record annual results at our parks, experiences, and products segment, and outstanding growth at our direct-to-consumer services, which added nearly 57 million subscriptions this year to reach a total of more than 235 million.

**Disney+: A Streaming Powerhouse**

It has taken just three short years for Disney+ to transform from a nascent business to an industry leader. That transformation is the direct result of the strategic decision we made at launch to heavily invest in our direct-to-consumer offering, a decision made knowing that achieving rapid growth would result in short-term losses. Building a streaming powerhouse has required significant investment. And now, with scale, incredible content pipeline, and global reach, Disney+ is well-situated to leverage our position for long-term profitability and success.

**Financial Results and Outlook**

Our financial results this quarter represent a turning point as we reached peak DTC operating losses, which we expect to decline going forward. That expectation is based on three factors: first, the benefit of both price increases and the launch of the Disney+ ad tier next month; second, a realignment of our cost, including meaningful rationalization of our marketing spend; and third, leveraging our learnings and experience in direct-to-consumer to optimize our content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases that efficiently drive engagement and subscriber acquisition. With these factors, we believe we are on a path to profitable streaming business that generates shareholder value long into the future. And assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate, we still expect Disney+ to achieve profitability in fiscal 2024, as losses begin to shrink in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

**Parks, Experiences, and Products Segment**

Q4 was another strong period for parks, experiences, and products, which continue to deliver phenomenal results despite the impact of Hurricane Ian. I want to thank the amazing cast members in Orlando who went above and beyond to help keep our guests safe and entertained during the storm. Our parks team is laser-focused on enhancing the guest experience and creating those magical memories I mentioned at the outset. This focus, along with the investments we made to bring new attractions and experiences to our domestic parks, is generating consistently strong demand, which, on many days, exceeds our current capacity.

**Content Engine**

This quarter was exceptionally strong in terms of creative excellence across our content engines. Our teams received 57 Emmy Awards, spread across a remarkable 37 different titles, emanating from a wide range of brands, franchises, and distribution channels. ABC ended the season as No. 1 in entertainment programing for the third consecutive year, and ABC News continues to be the most trusted source of news with No. 1 positions across all dayparts. Theatrically, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" earned over $760 million worldwide. This is our first time we released a fourth film based on a single Marvel character, and Thor's longevity is a great sign for Marvel and our ability to tell stories based on its characters long into the future.

**Looking Ahead**

Looking ahead, we are thrilled that audiences are returning to the box office for blockbuster films, and we have big plans for the big screen in the fiscal year 2023. ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" opens this Friday, and Ryan Coogler has delivered yet another culture-defining powerful film. The reaction to this film's premiere a few weeks ago was incredible. And fan anticipation is very high, as indicated by the strength of attendance ticket sales. Up next is ""Strange World"" from Walt Disney Animation Studios, which opens in theaters this Thanksgiving. The highly anticipated ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" opens on December 16th and is the sequel to the highest grossing film of all time.

**Depreciation Methods**

Depreciation reduces the value of assets, such as real estate and machinery, on a company's balance sheet. As a result, the amount of earnings on which taxes are based is reduced. While there are multiple accounting methods for determining depreciation, these methods are typically industry-specific. The four depreciation methods include straight-line, declining balance, sum-of-the-years' digits, and units of production.

**Investing and Trading: What's the Difference?**

Investing and trading are two different methods of attempting to profit in the financial markets. Both investors and traders seek profits through market participation. Investors generally seek larger returns over an extended period through buying and holding. Traders, by contrast, take advantage of both rising and falling markets to enter and exit positions over a shorter time frame, taking smaller, more frequent profits.

0.405576679340938,"When you apply for a mortgage to buy a home, expect to pay something up front with a down payment. Your down payment can significantly reduce the amount you owe to the lender, the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan, and your monthly mortgage payment.
The size of your down payment depends on your savings, income, and budget for a new home. The amount you designate as a down payment helps a lender determine the loan amount for which you qualify and the type of mortgage that meets your needs. Paying too little upfront will cost you interest over time while putting down too much could deplete your savings or negatively affect your long-term financial health.
Your monthly mortgage payment will depend on your home price, down payment, loan term, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and interest rate on the loan (which is highly dependent on your credit score). Use the inputs below to get a sense of what your monthly mortgage payment could end up being.
A mortgage pre-approval is an official step where a lender verifies your financial information and credit history. Your mortgage application collects information regarding your estimated down payment amount, income, employment, debts, assets, credit report, and credit score.
Your down payment plays a role in determining your loan-to-value ratio, or LTV. To calculate the LTV ratio, the loan amount is divided by the fair market value determined by a property appraisal. The larger your down payment, the lower your LTV.
A lower LTV ratio presents less risk to lenders because you are adding more equity to your home and have a higher stake in your property relative to the outstanding loan balance. Since lenders use LTV to price mortgages, a lower LTV means you'll likely pay a lower interest rate on your mortgage. When your LTV ratio exceeds 80%, you’ll likely pay for Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).
Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is usually required when you have a conventional loan and make a down payment of less than 20 percent of the home’s purchase price. PMI protects the lender if the buyer stops making payments on the loan. Borrowers can request the lender drop the PMI requirement once the equity in the home reaches 20%.
Rather than simply borrowing the maximum loan amount a lender approves, evaluate your estimated monthly mortgage payment too. Lenders use two ratios to help determine the monthly mortgage amount you can afford. 28% of your gross monthly income is the maximum amount that should be used for housing expenses, including your monthly mortgage payment, homeowners insurance, and property taxes.

Find loan options from the best mortgage lenders.
Jumbo loans are the most common non-conforming conventional loan available to homebuyers. Lenders have varying qualifying guidelines for jumbo loans, which exceed a conforming loan limit set by the federal government.
Special programs in your state or local housing authority help first-time buyers. Many of these programs are available based on buyers’ income or financial needs. These programs, which usually offer assistance with down payment grants, can also help with closing costs. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development lists first-time homebuyer programs by state. Select your state, then “Homeownership Assistance,” to find the program nearest you.
Open a dedicated savings account for your down payment, cut your spending, pay off high interest debt, and perhaps get a second job to supplement your savings plan.
Your down payment on a home purchase impacts your mortgage type, the amount of your loan, and the loan's terms and conditions. A larger down payment will give you a lower loan-to-value ratio, or LTV, may qualify for a lower interest rate, and not require PMI. Down payments commonly range from 3% to 20% of the purchase price.

Coming up with enough cash for a down payment to buy a house can be the single biggest roadblock for prospective home buyers. But how much of a down payment do you really need? That depends on the type of loan, your lender and your priorities.
A down payment is the cash you pay upfront to make a large purchase, such as a home. You use a loan to pay the rest of the purchase price over time. Down payments are usually shown as a percentage of the price. A 10% down payment on a $350,000 home would be $35,000.
When applying for a mortgage to buy a house, the down payment is your contribution toward the purchase and represents your initial ownership stake in the home. The mortgage lender provides the rest of the money to buy the property.
You may have heard that you need to make a 20% down payment on a home, but that's really just the threshold many lenders use for requiring mortgage insurance on a conventional loan. You don't have to make a 20% down payment to buy a house.
In 2023, the typical down payment for first-time home buyers was 8%, according to the National Association of Realtors. The typical down payment was 19% for repeat buyers.
Making a lower down payment can get you to your goal of homeownership more quickly. However, a higher down payment brings down the principal (and lifetime interest payments), which might cost you less overall. Weigh the pros and cons to decide what’s best for you.
» MORE: What's the typical down payment on a house?
The minimum down payment required for a house varies depending on the type of mortgage you plan to apply for to purchase a home.
Guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, VA loans usually do not require a down payment. VA loans are for current and veteran military service members and eligible surviving spouses.
USDA loans, backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program, also have no down payment requirement. USDA loans are for rural and suburban home buyers who meet the program's income limits and other requirements.
Some conventional mortgages, such as HomeReady and Home Possible, require as little as 3% down, provided you meet certain income limits. Conventional loans are not backed by the government, but they follow the down payment guidelines set by the government-sponsored enterprises — or GSEs — Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
FHA loans, which are backed by the Federal Housing Administration, require as little as 3.5% down if you have a credit score that's at least 580. If you have a credit score that's between 500 and 579, FHA loans require a 10% down payment.
Jumbo loans are home loans that fall outside of the Federal Housing Finance Agency's conforming loan limits. Because these outsized loans can't be guaranteed by the GSEs, lenders tend to ask for higher down payments to offset some of the risk.
With low- or no-down-payment loans, you pay for the guarantee through fees or mortgage insurance, depending on the program.
A better mortgage interest rate. Lenders may shave a few fractions of a percentage point off your interest rate if you make a larger down payment. When you borrow less of the home's price, there's less risk for lenders, and they tend to reward this with more favorable terms.
More equity in your home right away. Your home equity is your home's value minus the amount you owe on your mortgage. In other words, it's the extent to which your home is an asset rather than a debt. More equity means more wealth.
A lower monthly mortgage payment. Borrowing less of your home's price lowers your principal, which also means you'll pay less interest over the life of the loan.
Lower upfront and ongoing fees. Low- or no-down-payment government-backed mortgage programs reduce lenders' risk by guaranteeing a portion of the loans. If a borrower defaults on one of these loans, the associated government agency will reimburse the lender. To offset some of that cost, these loans can come with significant one-time costs, like the VA funding fee, or added ongoing costs like FHA mortgage insurance.
The right down payment for you depends on your goals and financial situation. While there are plenty of pluses with a larger down payment, putting down too much could leave you strapped for cash after you move in.
Conventional mortgages usually require you to pay for private mortgage insurance if you put down less than 20%. Once you start making mortgage payments, you can ask to cancel PMI after you have over 20% equity in your home.
Try out some different scenarios to help you better understand how changing the size of your down payment can affect other costs.
» MORE: What’s the average down payment on a house?
Keep some savings in the bank. Avoid using your entire savings for a down payment. You could end up ""house poor,"" spending too much of your income servicing your mortgage or depleting your emergency fund.
Don’t forget about closing costs. It's also important to make sure you have enough cash on hand to cover closing costs, which are usually 2%-6% of the home's purchase price.
Plan for the ongoing costs of homeownership. Leaving a cushion for home maintenance and repairs, as well as potential emergencies, is a good idea even if you're purchasing a move-in-ready home. In all, you want to be sure your down payment leaves you with enough room to cover all the costs of buying a house — and furnishing it once you've moved in.
Shop around. Do your research and compare mortgage rates from three to five lenders. Don’t forget to look into programs offered by lenders and consider down payment assistance options, especially if you're a first-time home buyer.

The amount of your down payment varies depending on the cost of the home and what percentage of the offer price you're making as a payment. Using a down payment calculator can help you easily see down payment amounts and how altering your down payment affects your monthly mortgage payment.
A down payment allows you to make a large purchase, like buying a house, without having to pay all of the money at once. Instead, you pay a percentage of the purchase price upfront and borrow the rest. The loan balance is repaid over time, spreading the cost into manageable monthly payments.
When you buy a house, the down payment is paid on closing day — the day that you actually transfer money and get the keys to your new home. Your down payment will make up the largest chunk of that money, along with other closing costs. Because it's a substantial sum, closing costs are usually paid via a wire transfer or cashier's check.

The Concept of Down Payment: How Much You Need and Why It Matters

For many of us, buying a home is a significant life milestone. However, it often requires making a substantial upfront payment, known as a down payment. This initial investment can significantly impact the amount you owe to your lender, the interest you pay over the life of the loan, and your monthly mortgage payment.

Your down payment amount depends on several factors, including your savings, income, and budget for a new home. The amount you put down also influences the loan amount you qualify for and the type of mortgage that suits your needs. While paying too little upfront can cost you interest in the long run, putting down too much could deplete your savings or negatively affect your long-term financial health.

To get a sense of what your monthly mortgage payment might look like, consider the following factors: home price, down payment, loan term, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and interest rate on the loan (which is heavily dependent on your credit score).

A mortgage pre-approval is an official step where a lender verifies your financial information and credit history. This process collects information about your estimated down payment amount, income, employment, debts, assets, credit report, and credit score.

Your down payment plays a critical role in determining your loan-to-value ratio, or LTV. To calculate the LTV ratio, the loan amount is divided by the fair market value determined by a property appraisal. A larger down payment means a lower LTV ratio, which presents less risk to lenders. As a result, you may qualify for a lower interest rate on your mortgage.

However, if your LTV ratio exceeds 80%, you'll likely need to pay for Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). This insurance protects the lender in case you stop making payments on the loan. You can request the lender to drop the PMI requirement once the equity in your home reaches 20%.

In addition to considering the maximum loan amount a lender approves, evaluate your estimated monthly mortgage payment as well. Lenders use two ratios to determine the monthly mortgage amount you can afford. The general rule of thumb is that 28% of your gross monthly income should be the maximum amount used for housing expenses, including your monthly mortgage payment, homeowners insurance, and property taxes.

Taking Control of Your Down Payment

Your down payment on a home purchase significantly impacts the type of mortgage you qualify for, the loan amount, and the loan's terms and conditions. A larger down payment can result in a lower loan-to-value ratio, which may qualify you for a lower interest rate and avoid PMI. Down payments commonly range from 3% to 20% of the purchase price.

To make the most of your down payment, consider the following strategies:

* Open a dedicated savings account specifically for your down payment.
* Cut back on unnecessary expenses to supplement your savings plan.
* Pay off high-interest debt to free up more money for your down payment.
* Explore special programs in your state or local housing authority that offer assistance with down payment grants and closing costs.
* Consider jumbo loans, which may offer more flexible qualifying guidelines.

By understanding the significance of your down payment and taking proactive steps to manage it, you can set yourself up for financial success and achieve your homeownership goals.

**Understanding Down Payments: How They Impact Your Mortgage**

When you're buying a home, you'll need to make a down payment - and the amount you pay can significantly impact your mortgage. Your down payment determines how much you borrow, your monthly mortgage payment, and even the type of mortgage you qualify for.

**The Size of Your Down Payment Matters**

The amount you put down depends on your savings, income, and budget for a new home. A larger down payment means you'll borrow less, reducing your monthly mortgage payment and the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan. On the other hand, putting down too little can increase your costs in the long run.

**How Down Payments Affect Your Loan-to-Value Ratio**

Your down payment also affects your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which is the percentage of the home's value that you're borrowing. A lower LTV ratio means less risk for lenders, and you may qualify for a lower interest rate. If your LTV ratio exceeds 80%, you may need to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI).

**Private Mortgage Insurance: What You Need to Know**

PMI is usually required when you make a down payment of less than 20% of the home's purchase price. It protects lenders if you default on your loan, but it can increase your monthly mortgage payment.

**Evaluating Your Mortgage Options**

When applying for a mortgage, consider not only the loan amount but also your estimated monthly mortgage payment. Lenders use two ratios to determine how much you can afford to borrow: 28% of your gross monthly income for housing expenses and 36% for total debt payments.

**First-Time Homebuyer Programs: Getting Help with Down Payments**

If you're a first-time homebuyer, you may be eligible for special programs that offer down payment grants or assistance with closing costs.

**Saving for Your Down Payment**

To build your down payment fund, consider opening a dedicated savings account, cutting expenses, paying off high-interest debt, and even getting a second job.

**The Bottom Line**

Your down payment plays a critical role in determining your mortgage type, loan amount, and loan terms. By making a larger down payment, you can qualify for a lower interest rate, reduce your monthly mortgage payment, and avoid PMI.

0.401590457256461,"The technology sector is vast, comprising gadget makers, software developers, wireless providers, streaming services, semiconductor companies, and cloud computing providers, to name just a few. Any company that sells a product or service heavily infused with technology likely belongs to the tech sector.
Software companies are increasingly moving to a software-as-a-service model where customers buy a subscription to a program instead of a one-time license. The arrangement generates recurring revenue for the software company.
Semiconductor chips power the hardware. Semiconductor companies design and/or manufacture central processing units, graphics processing units, memory chips, and a wide variety of other chips that help to run today’s devices.
Telecom companies that provide wireless services are part of the tech sector. So are the video streaming companies that provide easy access to high-quality content, and the cloud computing providers that power those streaming services.
Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet (Google) are sometimes grouped together as the FAANG stocks. The companies dominate their industries, and their stocks have produced impressive returns during the past decade. That winning streak ended in 2022, though, when almost every major tech stock fell, along with the broader market.
It was impossible to predict in March 2020 how tech companies would fare as the COVID-19 pandemic shut down economies and led to massive job losses. Some tech companies saw immediate negative impacts. Alphabet and Meta, for example, suffered from big slowdowns in revenue growth as hard-hit industries such as travel and hospitality pulled back on advertising.
Other tech companies flourished. Amazon benefited from booming e-commerce sales as shoppers shied away from stores, and Netflix enjoyed a surge in subscribers as home-bound consumers had more time to watch TV. Insatiable demand for PCs, smartphones, and other gadgets boosted sales for Intel, Microsoft, and Apple. A potent combination of limited options for consumers to spend their money and unprecedented stimulus cash helped many tech companies report record revenue and profits.
But 2022 was the beginning of the end of the pandemic bonanza. Sky-high inflation led the Federal Reserve Board to rapidly increase interest rates, putting pressure on consumer spending. Shortages turned into gluts as supply chains improved and pandemic-level demand subsided. The stock market tumbled, entering bear market territory. Tech stocks were among the worst performers.

Chips are the building blocks of the technology we use every day.
For mature tech companies that produce profits, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric. Divide stock price by per-share earnings, and you get a multiple that tells you how highly the market values the company’s current earnings. The higher the multiple, the more value the market is placing on future earnings growth.
Many tech companies aren’t profitable, so the price-to-earnings ratio can’t evaluate them. Revenue growth matters more for younger companies. If you’re investing in something unproven, you want to make sure it has solid growth prospects.
For unprofitable tech companies, it’s also important that the bottom line be moving from losses toward profits. As a company grows, it should become more efficient, especially when it comes to the sales and marketing spending necessary to close deals. If it’s not, or if spending is growing as a percentage of revenue, that could indicate something is wrong.
Ultimately, a good tech stock is one that trades at a reasonable valuation, given its growth prospects. Accurately figuring out those growth prospects is the hard part. If you expect earnings to skyrocket in the coming years, paying a premium for the stock can make sense. But if you’re wrong about those growth prospects, your investment may not work out.
Investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that focuses on tech stocks is one way to avoid making mistakes. The Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK  1.01%) is one option, although the fund’s bets on high-flying tech stocks may ultimately prove riskier than investing in the tech giants listed above.
Investing in tech stocks can be risky, but you can reduce your risk by investing only when you feel confident their growth prospects justify their valuations.

Since inception, Motley Fool Stock Advisor has beaten the S&P 500 by more than 400% — and the team recently revealed their 10 top-ranked stocks you can buy right now.
Returns as of February 7, 2024.","The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), a benchmark for tech stocks, has risen about 20% in the past 12 months, outperforming the broader market amid increased interest in artificial intelligence. The Russell 1000 Index rose about 4% over the same period.
We look at the top tech stocks in three categories: the best value, the fastest growth, and the most momentum. Benchmark figures above are as of June 5, and all data below are as of June 4.
Value investing is a factor-based investing strategy that involves picking stocks that you believe are trading for less than what they are intrinsically worth, usually by measuring the ratio of the stock’s price to one or more fundamental business metrics. A widely accepted value metric is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.
Value investors believe that if a business is cheap compared with its intrinsic value (as measured by its P/E ratio, in this case), then its stock price may rise faster than that of others as the price comes back in line with the worth of the company. These are the tech stocks with the lowest 12-month trailing P/E ratio.
These are the top tech stocks as ranked by a growth model that scores companies based on a 50/50 weighting of their most recent quarterly year-over-year (YOY) percentage revenue growth and most recent quarterly YOY earnings-per-share (EPS) growth.
Both sales and earnings are critical factors in a company’s success. Therefore, ranking companies by only one growth metric makes a ranking susceptible to the accounting anomalies of that quarter (such as changes in tax law or restructuring costs) that may make one figure or the other unrepresentative of the business in general. Companies with a quarterly EPS or revenue growth of more than 1,000% were excluded as outliers.
Momentum investing is a factor-based investing strategy that involves investing in a stock whose price has risen faster than the market as a whole. Momentum investors believe that stocks that have outperformed the market will often continue to do so because the factors that caused them to outperform will not suddenly disappear.
In addition, other investors, seeking to benefit from the stock’s outperformance, will often purchase the stock, further bidding its price higher and pushing the stock up further. These are the tech stocks that had the highest total return over the past 12 months.
Technology stocks historically have underperformed other sectors during periods of rising inflation. Conversely, the group typically outpaces the broader market during times of falling inflation.
Why are technology stocks so sensitive to inflation? It all relates to interest rates. Rising inflation indicates that the Federal Reserve will likely increase its federal funds rate to taper demand.
Higher rates affect technology companies in two ways. First, consumers and businesses will have less income to buy products and services, which has the effect of slowing corporate earnings. Second, technology companies borrow heavily to fund startup costs, patents, and innovation expenses, and the cost of servicing that debt increases when interest rates rise.
The opposite happens when inflation declines. The Fed will likely lower interest rates then, which spurs consumer demand and reduces technology companies' borrowing costs.
Investing in Innovation: Investing in technology stocks allows investors to back revolutionary ideas that have the potential to improve people’s lives. Technology companies of all sizes continually push boundaries to be first to market with game-changing technology, whether it be Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a new health feature for its watch or a startup developing a game-changing semiconductor for the automotive industry.
Growth Potential: Technology stocks offer the potential for sizable gains, with investors usually prepared to pay a premium for future growth.

The Technology Sector: A Diverse and Dynamic Industry

The technology sector is a vast and diverse industry, encompassing a wide range of companies that specialize in software development, semiconductor manufacturing, wireless services, streaming services, and cloud computing, among others. Any company that relies heavily on technology to produce its products or services is likely to be classified within the tech sector.

The Shift to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

Software companies are increasingly adopting a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, where customers purchase a subscription to a program rather than a one-time license. This arrangement generates recurring revenue for software companies, providing a more stable and predictable stream of income.

Semiconductors: The Building Blocks of Modern Technology

Semiconductor companies design and manufacture central processing units, graphics processing units, memory chips, and other essential components that power modern devices. These chips are the backbone of the technology industry, enabling the development of innovative products and services.

Telecom and Streaming Services: Key Players in the Tech Sector

Telecom companies that provide wireless services, as well as video streaming services that offer easy access to high-quality content, are integral parts of the tech sector. Cloud computing providers, which power these streaming services, are also crucial components of the industry.

The FAANG Stocks: Dominant Players in the Tech Sector

Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet (Google) are often referred to as the FAANG stocks, due to their dominance in their respective industries. These companies have produced impressive returns over the past decade, although their winning streak came to an end in 2022, as the broader market experienced a decline.

The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Tech Stocks

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the tech sector, with some companies experiencing immediate negative effects. Alphabet and Meta, for example, suffered from a slowdown in revenue growth as hard-hit industries such as travel and hospitality reduced their advertising spending.

However, other tech companies thrived during the pandemic, with Amazon benefiting from the surge in e-commerce sales and Netflix enjoying a significant increase in subscribers. The demand for PCs, smartphones, and other gadgets boosted sales for Intel, Microsoft, and Apple, as consumers turned to online shopping and remote work.

The End of the Pandemic Bonanza

The tech sector's impressive performance during the pandemic came to an end in 2022, as the broader market experienced a decline. The Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes, combined with supply chain improvements and subsiding pandemic-level demand, led to a downturn in consumer spending and a subsequent decline in tech stocks.

Evaluating Tech Stocks: Key Metrics and Considerations

When evaluating tech stocks, investors should consider key metrics such as the price-to-earnings ratio, which provides a useful metric for mature tech companies that produce profits. For younger, unprofitable companies, revenue growth is a more important consideration.

Investors should also look for companies that demonstrate solid growth prospects, are becoming more efficient in their operations, and have a clear path to profitability. A good tech stock is one that trades at a reasonable valuation, given its growth prospects.

Investing in Tech Stocks: A Risk-Return Tradeoff

Investing in tech stocks can be risky, but investors can reduce their risk by investing only when they feel confident that a company's growth prospects justify its valuation. One way to mitigate risk is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that focuses on tech stocks, such as the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK).

0.4,"Inflationary pressures and rising interest rates are weighing on consumers and businesses alike. There's no telling when this economic pressure will subside, but one smart move you can make as an investor is focusing on companies with fortress balance sheets. High cash balances, low or no debt, and the ability to generate cash flows will give any company the ability to take advantage of a tough market, whether that means acquiring beaten-down companies, issuing dividends, or buying back their stocks at discounted rates.
Here are four such companies worth your consideration.
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.17%) (BRK.B 1.00%) CEO Warren Buffett always stands ready to take advantage when times get tough because of the vast amount of cash the company keeps on its balance sheet. At the end of last year, Berkshire's cash pile ballooned to $144 billion. Buffett says he always aims to keep cash on hand ""to be financially impregnable and never dependent on the kindness of strangers (or even that of friends).""
Berkshire has found opportunities in this market to put that cash to work this year, spending $51 billion on stocks during the first quarter.
Berkshire also uses little leverage in running the business. The debt-to-equity ratio shows you how much leverage a company is using. A ratio over 1 means the company uses more debt to fund its business; the lower the ratio, the lower the leverage used. Berkshire Hathaway's debt-to-equity ratio is a meager 0.24.
Berkshire is one of the best at managing its capital and is willing to wait for years to find an attractive buying opportunity, which is why it has delivered a 20% average annual return over its 57-year history.
Visa (V 0.95%) operates a global payments network, moving money across 200 countries using debit cards, credit cards, and other payment products. Visa's strength is its dominant payments network, processing 80% more volume in 2020 than its closest competitor, Mastercard.
High profit margins and strong cash flows can strengthen balance sheets, which Visa has because the business is quite capital light. Visa's profit margins are fantastic, at around 51%. Another benefit of high margins is that the company doesn't need to use much debt, and its debt-to-equity ratio is around 0.58.
Visa investors reap the rewards of this strong balance sheet, as the company spent $8.6 billion on dividends and buybacks for the six months ending March 31. Visa's high margins, cash flow generation, and strong position as a top payments network make it a stock you can buy today and potentially hold forever.
Tradeweb Markets (TW 2.41%) provides the biggest players in the financial system -- like central banks, hedge funds, and pension funds -- with a trading platform to buy and sell various assets. The company has done a stellar job of taking market share with its platform, putting it on solid footing.
Tradeweb had $828 million in cash through the end of the first quarter, but what makes the balance sheet most appealing to me is that it doesn't carry any long-term debt. The only thing Tradeweb has is a $500 million revolving credit facility for short-term financing in the event the company needs it, but the company isn't currently drawing from it. Tradeweb also generates solid free cash flow -- money left over after paying for operations and capital expenditures, which can then be reinvested in the business, used for acquisitions, or returned to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks.
Tradeweb Markets could benefit from volatility across assets, and there has been plenty of it to go around. Couple this with its strong balance sheet, and the company is another solid stock to own for the long haul.
T. Rowe Price Group (TROW 0.69%) actively manages investments, competing with passive index funds that have grown in recent years. Despite this, the firm has grown assets under management (AUM) at 12%, compounded annually, in the past decade.
The business is another cash-generating machine, earning $3.3 billion in free cash flow last year on solid profit margins. It also sits on a $2 billion cash balance and has no long-term debt outstanding.
Strong capital management is why T. Rowe Price is a Dividend Aristocrat, having increased its dividend for 36 consecutive years. Not only that, T. Rowe Price is currently trading around its cheapest valuation since 1990. Its valuation, capital management, and dividend history make this another stellar stock to buy despite volatility in the market.

The big bank estimates that the immediate future will bring either tighter regulations from the Fed or a major slowdown in economic growth, either of which will be less than beneficial for stocks. Notably, Goldman points out that its group of S&P 500 companies with strong balance sheets has outperformed those with weak balance sheets by 520 basis points over the past six months; this is a highly unusual circumstance in a 10%+ equity market rally, with an ominous precedent in 2000 at the height of the tech bubble. Here are some of the stocks that Goldman includes in its strong balance sheet grouping.
Apple (AAPL) is a stalwart of the strong balance sheet list. As the world's most valuable company, Apple ended 2016 with over $216 billion in cash and investments. As of the beginning of the year, Apple sported a dividend yield of 1.87%, placing it at the forefront of the tech sector. Its dividend has grown consistently since 2013, and its remarkable customer loyalty assures investors that Apple is likely to remain strong for the time to come.
Microsoft (MSFT) has more than $113 billion between its cash holdings and short-term investments. Besides, it is among the largest software developers in the world. As of the end of 2016, the company also sported an above-average stock yield and it maintains a stellar record when it comes to dividend growth. Its payout ratio typically lies above 50%.
Two of the four stocks making up the so-called FANG group have also made Goldman's list of companies with strong balance sheets. Both Facebook (FB) and Google's parent company, Alphabet (GOOGL) top the list. Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) did not make the cut.
Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) sports a total of over $65 billion between its cash and short-term investments, making it one of the strongest balance sheets of today. Cisco has seen its dividend yield grow quickly and now features a payout ratio of 48.1%, according to Dividend.com.
3M (MMM) is a remarkably consistent grower when it comes to dividends. While the company only has about $2.68 billion in cash, placing it much lower on the scale than the companies listed above, it compensates with a diversified business model, excellent fundamentals, and a strong history of dividend payments. Its dividend yield is 2.5% and its annualized payout is $4.44. What's more, the company has managed to grow its dividend consistently, making gains each year since 1959.

As inflationary pressures and rising interest rates continue to cast a shadow over the economy, investors would do well to focus on companies boasting fortress-like balance sheets. A strong cash position, negligible debt, and a demonstrated ability to generate robust cash flows can provide a company with the financial flexibility to capitalize on opportunities in a challenging market environment. Such companies may be well-positioned to take advantage of decreased valuations, issue dividends, or repurchase shares at discounted rates.

In this context, we highlight four companies worthy of consideration.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), led by CEO Warren Buffett, is renowned for its prodigious cash reserves, which swelled to a staggering $144 billion by the end of last year. Buffett's longstanding philosophy is to maintain a significant cash buffer to ""be financially impregnable and never dependent on the kindness of strangers (or even that of friends)."" Berkshire Hathaway has successfully deployed this capital in the current market, investing $51 billion in equities during the first quarter.

Notably, Berkshire Hathaway's debt-to-equity ratio stands at a modest 0.24, indicating a remarkably low level of leverage. The company's exceptional capital management and patient approach to investing have contributed to its impressive 20% average annual return over the past 57 years.

Visa (V) operates a formidable global payments network, processing transactions across 200 countries. The company's strength lies in its dominant market position, with an 80% volume advantage over its closest competitor, Mastercard, in 2020. High profit margins and robust cash flows have enabled Visa to fortify its balance sheet, which boasts a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.58. Visa's impressive profit margins, cash flow generation, and market leadership make it an attractive stock for investors seeking a long-term holding.

Tradeweb Markets (TW) provides a platform for institutional investors, including central banks, hedge funds, and pension funds, to buy and sell various assets. The company's stellar performance in taking market share has established a solid foundation for its future growth. Tradeweb's balance sheet is characterized by a cash balance of $828 million, with no long-term debt outstanding. Furthermore, the company generates substantial free cash flow, which can be reinvested in the business, allocated towards acquisitions, or returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. Tradeweb Markets is poised to benefit from market volatility, making it an appealing stock for long-term investors.

T. Rowe Price Group (TROW) actively manages investments, competing with passive index funds that have gained popularity in recent years. Despite this, the firm has achieved a 12% compound annual growth rate in assets under management over the past decade. The business is a cash-generating machine, with $3.3 billion in free cash flow last year, supported by solid profit margins. T. Rowe Price boasts a $2 billion cash balance and no long-term debt, earning it a position as a Dividend Aristocrat with 36 consecutive years of dividend increases. Currently trading at its cheapest valuation since 1990, T. Rowe Price is an attractive stock for investors seeking to capitalize on market volatility.

In conclusion, these four companies, with their strong balance sheets and demonstrated ability to capitalize on market opportunities, are worth considering for investors seeking to navigate the current economic landscape.

Inflationary Pressures and Rising Interest Rates: A Call to Focus on Fortress Balance Sheets

As economic pressures mount, investors would do well to focus on companies with robust balance sheets. High cash balances, low or no debt, and strong cash flow generation can provide a company with the flexibility to capitalize on market opportunities, whether that means acquiring undervalued companies, issuing dividends, or repurchasing shares at discounted prices.

With this in mind, we've identified four companies that stand out for their fortress balance sheets.

Berkshire Hathaway: A Cash Rich Empire

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway boasts an impressive cash pile of $144 billion, providing the company with the firepower to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise. With a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.24, Berkshire Hathaway's financial position is rock-solid. The company's 20% average annual return over its 57-year history is a testament to its disciplined approach to capital management.

Visa: A Payments Powerhouse with a Strong Balance Sheet

Visa's dominance in the payments industry is built on its robust balance sheet. With profit margins of 51% and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.58, the company has the financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives and return value to shareholders. Visa's strong cash flow generation has enabled the company to spend $8.6 billion on dividends and share repurchases in the six months ending March 31.

Tradeweb Markets: A Trading Platform with a Pristine Balance Sheet

Tradeweb Markets boasts a strong balance sheet with $828 million in cash and no long-term debt. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is zero, and its free cash flow generation provides it with the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives or return value to shareholders. As a leading trading platform, Tradeweb Markets is well-positioned to benefit from market volatility.

T. Rowe Price Group: A Cash-Generating Machine with a Strong Balance Sheet

T. Rowe Price Group's active management approach has enabled it to grow assets under management at a 12% compound annual rate over the past decade. With a cash balance of $2 billion and no long-term debt, the company's balance sheet is robust. T. Rowe Price Group's strong capital management has earned it a place as a Dividend Aristocrat, with 36 consecutive years of dividend increases.

Investing in companies with fortress balance sheets can provide investors with a degree of comfort in uncertain markets. By focusing on companies with strong financial positions, investors can reduce their exposure to risk and increase their potential for long-term returns.

0.394849785407725,"The technology sector is vast, comprising gadget makers, software developers, wireless providers, streaming services, semiconductor companies, and cloud computing providers, to name just a few. Any company that sells a product or service heavily infused with technology likely belongs to the tech sector.
Software companies are increasingly moving to a software-as-a-service model where customers buy a subscription to a program instead of a one-time license. The arrangement generates recurring revenue for the software company.
Semiconductor chips power the hardware. Semiconductor companies design and/or manufacture central processing units, graphics processing units, memory chips, and a wide variety of other chips that help to run today’s devices.
Telecom companies that provide wireless services are part of the tech sector. So are the video streaming companies that provide easy access to high-quality content, and the cloud computing providers that power those streaming services.
Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet (Google) are sometimes grouped together as the FAANG stocks. The companies dominate their industries, and their stocks have produced impressive returns during the past decade. That winning streak ended in 2022, though, when almost every major tech stock fell, along with the broader market.
It was impossible to predict in March 2020 how tech companies would fare as the COVID-19 pandemic shut down economies and led to massive job losses. Some tech companies saw immediate negative impacts. Alphabet and Meta, for example, suffered from big slowdowns in revenue growth as hard-hit industries such as travel and hospitality pulled back on advertising.
Other tech companies flourished. Amazon benefited from booming e-commerce sales as shoppers shied away from stores, and Netflix enjoyed a surge in subscribers as home-bound consumers had more time to watch TV. Insatiable demand for PCs, smartphones, and other gadgets boosted sales for Intel, Microsoft, and Apple. A potent combination of limited options for consumers to spend their money and unprecedented stimulus cash helped many tech companies report record revenue and profits.
But 2022 was the beginning of the end of the pandemic bonanza. Sky-high inflation led the Federal Reserve Board to rapidly increase interest rates, putting pressure on consumer spending. Shortages turned into gluts as supply chains improved and pandemic-level demand subsided. The stock market tumbled, entering bear market territory. Tech stocks were among the worst performers.

For mature tech companies that produce profits, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric. Divide stock price by per-share earnings, and you get a multiple that tells you how highly the market values the company’s current earnings. The higher the multiple, the more value the market is placing on future earnings growth.
Many tech companies aren’t profitable, so the price-to-earnings ratio can’t evaluate them. Revenue growth matters more for younger companies. If you’re investing in something unproven, you want to make sure it has solid growth prospects.
For unprofitable tech companies, it’s also important that the bottom line be moving from losses toward profits. As a company grows, it should become more efficient, especially when it comes to the sales and marketing spending necessary to close deals. If it’s not, or if spending is growing as a percentage of revenue, that could indicate something is wrong.
Ultimately, a good tech stock is one that trades at a reasonable valuation, given its growth prospects. Accurately figuring out those growth prospects is the hard part. If you expect earnings to skyrocket in the coming years, paying a premium for the stock can make sense. But if you’re wrong about those growth prospects, your investment may not work out.
Investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that focuses on tech stocks is one way to avoid making mistakes. The Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK  1.01%) is one option, although the fund’s bets on high-flying tech stocks may ultimately prove riskier than investing in the tech giants listed above.
Investing in tech stocks can be risky, but you can reduce your risk by investing only when you feel confident their growth prospects justify their valuations.

In the early days of the pandemic, technology stocks were the talk of the town. Companies that provided quick, innovative solutions to a changing world’s problems were handsomely rewarded by the stock market.
Since then, that enthusiasm has dampened, with worries of a looming recession hitting tech companies especially hard. High inflation and resulting sharp interest rate increases often mean lower profits for debt-heavy tech companies.
Yet, many investors remain interested in tech stocks — and for good reason. Technology will play a major role in the future, helping to resolve questions about sustainable energy, automation, health care and housing.
Here’s an overview of what tech stocks are, a list of the best-performing tech stocks right now and your options for buying them.
Technology stocks are publicly traded shares of companies specializing in the development and sale of technology products and services. You’re likely at least familiar with some of the major players in this sector: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL) are tech giants with some of the highest market capitalizations on the stock market.
The tech sector is also one of the largest and most diverse sections of the stock market. Companies that fall under the tech umbrella span multiple industries and offer a huge range of services and products.
The Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, makes this easier to digest by grouping tech stocks into three main categories: software and services, hardware and equipment, and semiconductors. Companies can fall within one category or stretch across a few, depending on their offerings.
Companies that produce software or services for technology-based industries such as cybersecurity, data analysis, cloud computing and storage, artificial intelligence, workflow and project management, video streaming and conferencing, and social media.
Companies that manufacture or sell physical tech products such as laptops and computers, printers, hard drives, AI home assistants, GPS devices and smart watches, phones or appliances.
Companies that create and manufacture various chips, circuits and other physical components that power electronic devices such as phones, computers and cars.

when you open and fund an account with Webull.
Diversification. The tech sector spans a broad array of industries as well as product/service categories, including cloud computing, e-commerce and social media services. This gives investors space to diversify their holdings across a swath of companies big and small.
Growth. With big risk sometimes comes big reward. This mantra is especially salient in the tech sector. Tech stocks are viewed by many investors as opportunities to invest in cutting-edge technology, which can be rewarding if a company’s product or service takes off.
Volatility. Data breaches, competition and economic trends, such as interest rate hikes, can affect a tech stock’s performance, which can impact a stock’s value. Compared with other sectors, tech also contains a higher concentration of less-established companies that might not have turned a profit yet, which can make it more difficult to assess the risks of investing.
Sky-high valuations. Tech stocks are known for being valued at very high prices. This might sound good, but when stocks are highly valued, their performance must keep up with the valuation to justify their price. When performance and earnings lag behind the initial valuation, the stock’s value can quickly plummet, leaving investors who bought in at a high feeling very … well, low.
Few offer dividends. If dividends are important to you as an investor, tech stocks might leave you wanting for more. Though a few major industry players, such as Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) offer this perk, the majority of companies that make up this sector tend to reinvest their earnings rather than distribute payouts to their shareholders.
How you choose to invest in tech stocks depends on your investment strategy and goals.
Choosing to drop serious cash on a single company is not an investment strategy that is well-suited for everyone. Doing so requires caution, research and the weighing of risks. If you want to go this route, you’ll also likely need to open a brokerage account if you don’t have one.
Basic due diligence should include understanding what the company does, what products or services it offers and how its business model addresses future needs. Reviewing the company’s financials, such as price-to-earnings ratios, profit margins and balance sheets, is also key.
Experts maintain that a good rule of thumb is to limit individual stocks to about 10% of your overall investment, so choose wisely. Finally, ensure that new investments you undertake jibe with your risk tolerance and your portfolio’s asset allocation. Find more information on investing by reading our primer on how to invest in stocks.
If you’re not sure investing in a single company is right for you, consider exploring exchange-traded funds or mutual funds instead. These funds are composed of a broad range of stocks that will often provide some exposure to the tech sector. Purchasing a fund also allows you to diversify your holdings and can help you avoid the risks of funneling your hard-earned money into one specific stock.
Index funds, which follow existing indices such as the Nasdaq, are another option. Any returns or losses you make will mirror the index the fund is trailing.
And if you’re interested in technology stocks and want to go the fund route, you can consider tech-focused ETFs, mutual funds and index funds. For example, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is a large-cap ETF with over $30 billion in assets under management. Its holdings include Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia.
You can invest in funds via a brokerage or, if you prefer a hands-off approach, through a robo-advisor.

**Software as a Service: A New Business Model**

Software companies are increasingly moving to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, where customers buy a subscription to a program instead of a one-time license. This arrangement generates recurring revenue for the software company.

**The Power Behind the Gadgets: Semiconductor Chips**

Semiconductor chips power the hardware behind today's devices. These companies design and manufacture central processing units, graphics processing units, memory chips, and a wide variety of other chips that help run our gadgets.

**Telecom and Streaming: Connected and Entertained**

Telecom companies that provide wireless services are part of the tech sector, as are video streaming companies that provide easy access to high-quality content. Cloud computing providers power these streaming services, making it all possible.

**The FAANG Stocks: Tech Giants**

Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet (Google) are sometimes grouped together as the FAANG stocks. These companies dominate their industries, and their stocks have produced impressive returns over the years.

**The Pandemic's Impact on Tech Stocks**

The COVID-19 pandemic had a mixed impact on tech companies. Some, like Alphabet and Meta, suffered from slower revenue growth as industries like travel and hospitality pulled back on advertising. Others, like Amazon and Netflix, flourished as people turned to e-commerce and streaming services.

**The End of the Pandemic Bonanza**

But 2022 marked the beginning of the end of the pandemic bonanza. Sky-high inflation led the Federal Reserve Board to rapidly increase interest rates, putting pressure on consumer spending. The stock market tumbled, entering bear market territory. Tech stocks were among the worst performers.

**Investing in Robotics-Related Stocks**

We explore the potential for seven top robotics-related stocks. Not all tech stocks are worth trillions, and not all tech stocks worth less than billions should be ignored by investors.

**Making Money with Internet of Things Companies**

Learn how to make money by investing in internet of things (IoT) companies.

**The Building Blocks of Technology: Chips**

Chips are the building blocks of the technology we use every day.

**Evaluating Tech Stocks: Price-to-Earnings Ratio**

For mature tech companies that produce profits, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric. Divide the stock price by per-share earnings, and you get a multiple that tells you how highly the market values the company's current earnings.

**Revenue Growth Matters for Younger Companies**

For unprofitable tech companies, revenue growth matters more. If you're investing in something unproven, you want to make sure it has solid growth prospects.

**The Bottom Line: Profitability Matters**

Ultimately, a good tech stock is one that trades at a reasonable valuation, given its growth prospects. Accurately figuring out those growth prospects is the hard part.

**Diversifying with an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)**

Investing in an ETF that focuses on tech stocks is one way to avoid making mistakes. The Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is one option, although the fund's bets on high-flying tech stocks may ultimately prove riskier than investing in the tech giants listed above.

**Reducing Risk: Invest with Confidence**

Investing in tech stocks can be risky, but you can reduce your risk by investing only when you feel confident their growth prospects justify their valuations.

**Get Market-Beating Stocks from The Motley Fool**

The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team has identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

0.39067055393586,"The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), a benchmark for tech stocks, has risen about 20% in the past 12 months, outperforming the broader market amid increased interest in artificial intelligence. The Russell 1000 Index rose about 4% over the same period.
We look at the top tech stocks in three categories: the best value, the fastest growth, and the most momentum. Benchmark figures above are as of June 5, and all data below are as of June 4.
Value investing is a factor-based investing strategy that involves picking stocks that you believe are trading for less than what they are intrinsically worth, usually by measuring the ratio of the stock’s price to one or more fundamental business metrics. A widely accepted value metric is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.
Value investors believe that if a business is cheap compared with its intrinsic value (as measured by its P/E ratio, in this case), then its stock price may rise faster than that of others as the price comes back in line with the worth of the company. These are the tech stocks with the lowest 12-month trailing P/E ratio.
These are the top tech stocks as ranked by a growth model that scores companies based on a 50/50 weighting of their most recent quarterly year-over-year (YOY) percentage revenue growth and most recent quarterly YOY earnings-per-share (EPS) growth.
Both sales and earnings are critical factors in a company’s success. Therefore, ranking companies by only one growth metric makes a ranking susceptible to the accounting anomalies of that quarter (such as changes in tax law or restructuring costs) that may make one figure or the other unrepresentative of the business in general. Companies with a quarterly EPS or revenue growth of more than 1,000% were excluded as outliers.
Momentum investing is a factor-based investing strategy that involves investing in a stock whose price has risen faster than the market as a whole. Momentum investors believe that stocks that have outperformed the market will often continue to do so because the factors that caused them to outperform will not suddenly disappear.
In addition, other investors, seeking to benefit from the stock’s outperformance, will often purchase the stock, further bidding its price higher and pushing the stock up further. These are the tech stocks that had the highest total return over the past 12 months.
Technology stocks historically have underperformed other sectors during periods of rising inflation. Conversely, the group typically outpaces the broader market during times of falling inflation.
Why are technology stocks so sensitive to inflation? It all relates to interest rates. Rising inflation indicates that the Federal Reserve will likely increase its federal funds rate to taper demand.
Higher rates affect technology companies in two ways. First, consumers and businesses will have less income to buy products and services, which has the effect of slowing corporate earnings. Second, technology companies borrow heavily to fund startup costs, patents, and innovation expenses, and the cost of servicing that debt increases when interest rates rise.
The opposite happens when inflation declines. The Fed will likely lower interest rates then, which spurs consumer demand and reduces technology companies' borrowing costs.
Investing in Innovation: Investing in technology stocks allows investors to back revolutionary ideas that have the potential to improve people’s lives. Technology companies of all sizes continually push boundaries to be first to market with game-changing technology, whether it be Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a new health feature for its watch or a startup developing a game-changing semiconductor for the automotive industry.
Growth Potential: Technology stocks offer the potential for sizable gains, with investors usually prepared to pay a premium for future growth.

In the early days of the pandemic, technology stocks were the talk of the town. Companies that provided quick, innovative solutions to a changing world’s problems were handsomely rewarded by the stock market.
Since then, that enthusiasm has dampened, with worries of a looming recession hitting tech companies especially hard. High inflation and resulting sharp interest rate increases often mean lower profits for debt-heavy tech companies.
Yet, many investors remain interested in tech stocks — and for good reason. Technology will play a major role in the future, helping to resolve questions about sustainable energy, automation, health care and housing.
Here’s an overview of what tech stocks are, a list of the best-performing tech stocks right now and your options for buying them.
Technology stocks are publicly traded shares of companies specializing in the development and sale of technology products and services. You’re likely at least familiar with some of the major players in this sector: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL) are tech giants with some of the highest market capitalizations on the stock market.
The tech sector is also one of the largest and most diverse sections of the stock market. Companies that fall under the tech umbrella span multiple industries and offer a huge range of services and products.
The Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, makes this easier to digest by grouping tech stocks into three main categories: software and services, hardware and equipment, and semiconductors. Companies can fall within one category or stretch across a few, depending on their offerings.
Companies that produce software or services for technology-based industries such as cybersecurity, data analysis, cloud computing and storage, artificial intelligence, workflow and project management, video streaming and conferencing, and social media.
Companies that manufacture or sell physical tech products such as laptops and computers, printers, hard drives, AI home assistants, GPS devices and smart watches, phones or appliances.
Companies that create and manufacture various chips, circuits and other physical components that power electronic devices such as phones, computers and cars.
Below are the 7 best-performing stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index from the technology sector, in order of one-year returns.

Diversification. The tech sector spans a broad array of industries as well as product/service categories, including cloud computing, e-commerce and social media services. This gives investors space to diversify their holdings across a swath of companies big and small.
Growth. With big risk sometimes comes big reward. This mantra is especially salient in the tech sector. Tech stocks are viewed by many investors as opportunities to invest in cutting-edge technology, which can be rewarding if a company’s product or service takes off.
Volatility. Data breaches, competition and economic trends, such as interest rate hikes, can affect a tech stock’s performance, which can impact a stock’s value. Compared with other sectors, tech also contains a higher concentration of less-established companies that might not have turned a profit yet, which can make it more difficult to assess the risks of investing.
Sky-high valuations. Tech stocks are known for being valued at very high prices. This might sound good, but when stocks are highly valued, their performance must keep up with the valuation to justify their price. When performance and earnings lag behind the initial valuation, the stock’s value can quickly plummet, leaving investors who bought in at a high feeling very … well, low.
Few offer dividends. If dividends are important to you as an investor, tech stocks might leave you wanting for more. Though a few major industry players, such as Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) offer this perk, the majority of companies that make up this sector tend to reinvest their earnings rather than distribute payouts to their shareholders.
How you choose to invest in tech stocks depends on your investment strategy and goals.
Choosing to drop serious cash on a single company is not an investment strategy that is well-suited for everyone. Doing so requires caution, research and the weighing of risks. If you want to go this route, you’ll also likely need to open a brokerage account if you don’t have one.
Basic due diligence should include understanding what the company does, what products or services it offers and how its business model addresses future needs. Reviewing the company’s financials, such as price-to-earnings ratios, profit margins and balance sheets, is also key.
Experts maintain that a good rule of thumb is to limit individual stocks to about 10% of your overall investment, so choose wisely. Finally, ensure that new investments you undertake jibe with your risk tolerance and your portfolio’s asset allocation. Find more information on investing by reading our primer on how to invest in stocks.
If you’re not sure investing in a single company is right for you, consider exploring exchange-traded funds or mutual funds instead. These funds are composed of a broad range of stocks that will often provide some exposure to the tech sector. Purchasing a fund also allows you to diversify your holdings and can help you avoid the risks of funneling your hard-earned money into one specific stock.
Index funds, which follow existing indices such as the Nasdaq, are another option. Any returns or losses you make will mirror the index the fund is trailing.
And if you’re interested in technology stocks and want to go the fund route, you can consider tech-focused ETFs, mutual funds and index funds. For example, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is a large-cap ETF with over $30 billion in assets under management. Its holdings include Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia.
You can invest in funds via a brokerage or, if you prefer a hands-off approach, through a robo-advisor.

The mortgage industry is full of individuals and companies helping people get access to financing for one of the biggest investments in their lives. These entities include mortgage brokers and direct lenders.
While they may provide services to people seeking mortgage loans, they are very different. A mortgage broker acts as an intermediary by helping consumers identify the best lender for their situation, while a direct lender is a bank or other financial institution that decides whether you qualify for the loan and, if you do, hands over the check.
When a prospective homeowner is ready to shop around for a mortgage, they may decide to consult with a mortgage broker. This is a financial professional who brings together borrowers and lenders. They are not lenders and, as such, do not use their own funds to advance mortgage loans. Instead, they act as intermediaries, helping consumers comparison shop, bringing them a variety of quotes from different lenders at one time.
To do this, a mortgage broker sits down with their clients to assess their needs and financial situation. They gather important information and documents that lenders require from the borrower, including income, pay stubs, tax returns, details on assets and investments, and credit reports. This helps them evaluate how much a consumer can afford to borrow.
Once amassed, they take this information to a bank or other lender for loan approval. Brokers are also responsible for communicating between borrowers and lenders during the application and approval process.
A good mortgage broker should be able to bring valuable information to the table, such as which lenders loan money in certain areas, which ones offer a specific type of mortgage, and which welcome or avoid applications on loans for certain types of homes such as co-ops, condos, or multi-family homes. Mortgage brokers can also work with borrowers who have a hard time getting approved through direct lenders’ automated underwriting process due to recent bankruptcy, poor credit, or unsteady employment.
Mortgage brokers provide the convenience of being a one-stop-shop. This eliminates the need to visit multiple lenders to try to get the best rate and, ultimately, approval for a mortgage. And consumers won’t have multiple hits to their credit reports since they only have to visit one person to secure the best loan possible.
When working with a mortgage broker, it is wise to run a quick comparison to see if the rates and fees that they are offering are truly competitive. There are several companies that allow you to transparently see their rates and fees in under five minutes without a credit check, provided you meet their loan criteria.
Mortgage brokers don’t advance loans but do provide a one-stop shop with access to multiple lenders, while a direct lender is a single entity that cuts out the middleman.
A direct lender is a financial institution or private entity that actually provides the loan for a mortgage. Direct lenders may be banks and other financial institutions. Some direct lenders are private companies that deal specifically with financing mortgage loans for the general public—many of which operate online. For instance, borrowers that use lenders like Quicken Loans and Loan Direct can complete and get their approvals online.
Many borrowers choose to go with a lender with whom they’ve already done business. Having a long-standing relationship may help secure a better—or bigger—loan amount, not to mention a better interest rate. The process of applying for a mortgage through a direct lender is the same as it is with a mortgage broker: providing documentation, filling out the application, and waiting for approval. A mortgage calculator can show you the impact of a better interest rate on your monthly payment.
Your monthly mortgage payment will depend on your home price, down payment, loan term, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and interest rate on the loan (which is highly dependent on your credit score). Use the inputs below to get a sense of what your monthly mortgage payment could end up being.
Consumers cut out the middleman by going to a direct lender. Doing so may also make the loan process faster. Since the lender deals directly with the consumer, the two can communicate effectively with one another rather than having to rely on someone else to relay messages back and forth. So, if a consumer has any questions during the application and/or approval process, they can go directly to the lender.
The goal is to find the direct lender with the best rate and have a backup if the first choice doesn’t come through. But there is a pitfall to choosing a direct lender. Skipping a mortgage broker may mean going through the application process with more than one direct lender. Shopping around like this can be tedious and time-consuming. It can also mean taking a hit to your credit score if you’re applying with multiple lenders within a short period of time.
Compensation is one of the key differences between mortgage brokers and direct lenders. Mortgage brokers are paid on a fee-based schedule. In most cases, the loan origination fee charged by the bank is paid to the broker.
This figure is based on the total amount of the loan, which can influence a broker’s advice and research. Like some commission-based financial planners, some brokers work mainly with—or are partial to—certain lenders, which could influence the choices that they offer you.
Consumers aren’t obligated in any way to choose between mortgage brokers and direct lenders. In fact, they can call both to compare their rates and judge which route they want to take.
A bank may be a good place to start, especially for those who have a good relationship with their own financial institutions. For people who don’t want the hassle of contacting different banks, mortgage brokers are a better option. As mentioned above, some lenders work exclusively with mortgage brokers and some brokers work exclusively with specific lenders.
This may provide borrowers access to loans that they would otherwise not even hear about. But it’s always a good idea to ask what their rationale is for suggesting a specific lender.
Mortgage brokers once had a dicey reputation, so it’s no surprise that many people are still hesitant to use them. They were loosely regulated, and their compensation was based on the nature and size of the loan. Some persuaded borrowers to choose high-risk mortgages or to borrow more than they really needed. But increased regulation and consumer protection laws make them a good alternative for consumers who want to have someone else do all the shopping and talking for them.
Investopedia’s best overall pick for direct mortgage lenders is Quicken Loans, better known as Rocket Mortgage. For those looking for a more modernized process, Better.com uses software that links to popular banks and tax prep software like TurboTax so you don’t have to track down tax returns and statements to upload. If you prefer to work with someone local over a national company, then your local bank or credit union is a great place to start.
Mortgage brokers tend to be more localized, so the best place to start your search is by asking friends, family, and your real estate agent for referrals. You can also submit an inquiry on a website like LendingTree, and brokers will contact you directly. If you prefer not to get dozens of calls from brokers, you can search for them directly through sites that aggregate local, independent mortgage brokers throughout the country. Some lender sites, such as Rocket Mortgage, also have a search engine that will connect you with local mortgage brokers.
You’ll have access to multiple lenders, which gives you a good idea of how multiple lenders will qualify you. This can give you more flexibility, especially if your circumstances mean that you don’t fit into a category typically recognized by lenders.
Fees might be one disadvantage to working with a broker. Some mortgage brokers charge a fee to the buyer. In cases where the lender covers the fee, it is important to ensure that you are not being steered toward a more expensive loan because it comes with a higher commission for the broker.
Direct lenders can make funding decisions quickly since they control their own lending criteria. This allows them greater control over which customers get the funds that they’re seeking. Another advantage is that many large direct mortgage lenders are licensed nationwide, which means that they can help buyers from any state. When a borrower is looking to buy a home in another state, direct lenders can be a great source of help.
For one, you must apply individually with each lender. When dealing with direct lenders, there are no brokers to assist in the tasks of gathering documents and assessing your financial status.
Another drawback is the approval of your application. Direct lenders have their own underwriting and loan terms. If there are problems with your application that they cannot overcome, then your loan application could be denied. If this happens, you’ll have to start a new application with a new lender.
While a mortgage broker is a one-stop shop for multiple options, their fees come from the lender, so it may be possible for well-qualified buyers to get better rates and fees by cutting out the middleman. Individuals who are less qualified buyers or are buying less traditional properties will have an easier time finding loans for which they can be approved by going through a mortgage broker than by going through individual direct lenders with generally stricter criteria for approval.

Whether it's better to work with a mortgage broker or get a home loan directly from a bank depends on your financial situation and your preferences. For example, if you might have trouble qualifying for a mortgage or you place a high value on convenience, a mortgage broker may be worthwhile for you. On the other hand, working directly with a bank might make more sense if you’re comfortable crunching some numbers and you want to feel more in control of the homebuying process.
Working with a mortgage broker vs. a bank is like working with a travel agent vs. researching and booking a trip on your own. It might be less hassle on your end to work with a professional, but there may be tradeoffs for that convenience.
Banks are one type of direct lender; when you're getting a mortgage, the bank is directly lending you the money to buy a home. Other types of direct lenders include online lenders specializing in mortgages, specialty lenders that cater to certain types of home buyers (like companies that focus on military service members) and credit unions.
When you shop for a home loan with a bank, you're doing the legwork of figuring out whether that bank is right for you. So chances are, you'll find yourself setting up a spreadsheet or at least making a list to keep track of rates, fees and other considerations.
A mortgage broker serves as an intermediary between you and direct lenders, which include banks. After discussing your needs, mortgage brokers take care of the rest. They reach out to their contacts at direct lenders and come back to you with options that fit your criteria. The broker then works with you to figure out which loan best suits your circumstances and continues to facilitate the transaction through the closing.
There are several advantages to using a mortgage broker versus a bank. Doing the research and finding a mortgage lender on your own can match some of the benefits of working with a broker, but a mortgage broker may have access to more resources.
Help with prep. You can start working with a mortgage broker reasonably early in the homebuying process. In addition to answering your questions about getting a home loan, a mortgage broker can help you go about gathering all the documents and information you'll need to apply for a mortgage.
Access to various loans. A bank's loan officer can only present you with home loan products the bank offers. A mortgage broker, on the other hand, can help you obtain any home loan. If you're looking for a type of mortgage that's less common, working with a broker can give you a shortcut straight to the relevant lenders.
Customized assistance. Suppose you're someone who might not qualify for a home loan, or you have circumstances that require more explanation (for example, gaps in employment or a thin credit file). In that case, a mortgage broker may be able to help you find lenders amenable to your situation. Even if you're a borrower who wouldn't have any trouble getting a mortgage, a broker will meet with you (in person or virtually), go over loan options, highlight points of comparison and support you in making an informed decision.
Convenience. Getting a mortgage is a time-intensive process. Even after doing all the due diligence to find the right bank for you, the actual application and loan closing process are intense, with lots of back-and-forth and requests for documents you swore you already provided twice. A mortgage broker will generally handle the paperwork and lender-wrangling on your behalf; a good mortgage broker will save you time and stress.
Working with a mortgage broker isn't for everyone. If you feel comfortable talking to loan officers and want to be in the driver's seat, you may work directly with a bank.
Direct connection. If you're working with a loan officer at a bank, you're working with a bank employee. They should be able to address any issues right away. On the other hand, when you're working with a mortgage broker, they may not always be able to influence what goes on at the bank since they don't work for it.
Potential discounts. While it may feel easiest to go with your existing bank when you're ready to buy a home, it's always a good idea to shop around to find the best mortgage rates. But make your bank one of the options you shop, since many offer discounts to existing customers who use other products or services like credit cards, checking, or savings accounts. For example, if your bank already offers you a low rate and favorable terms, getting a discount on closing costs or paying no origination fee might be enough to tip the scale.
Fewer fees. Mortgage brokers don't work for free, and if you use one, that adds to the cost of your home loan. Generally, mortgage brokers earn a flat fee equal to 1% to 2% of the total cost of the loan. If you pay this as the borrower, it may be part of your closing costs or rolled into the loan amount. Sometimes the lender will pay the mortgage broker (since, after all, the broker is bringing the lender business). Although that may look less expensive on paper, your lender might build the broker’s fee into the cost of your loan. Mortgage brokers must disclose their fees upfront, so it's something you can ask about when you're looking for a broker. If you're paying the mortgage broker, they cannot receive additional compensation from the lender — either you pay, or the lender does.
Mortgage brokers by law cannot steer clients toward particular lenders solely to increase their compensation. If you compare a loan with lender-paid broker fees to one that would require you to pay, look closely at the numbers to be sure you're clear on the broker's fee.
Fewer people to manage. You might be able to cut out a lot of the headaches of the loan process by working with a mortgage broker, but you'll still have to do some research to find a mortgage broker in the first place. You'll want a mortgage broker who works well with you and also with your buyer's agent. If the relationship doesn't go as expected, you can change brokers — but then you're back to square one.

Mortgage Brokers vs. Direct Lenders: Which Route to Take?

When searching for a mortgage, homebuyers have two primary options: working with a mortgage broker or going directly to a lender. Both paths have their advantages and disadvantages, and understanding the differences is crucial in making an informed decision.

A mortgage broker acts as an intermediary, connecting borrowers with lenders. They don't use their own funds to advance mortgage loans; instead, they help consumers comparison shop, bringing together a variety of quotes from different lenders. This one-stop-shop approach eliminates the need to visit multiple lenders, and borrowers won't have multiple hits to their credit reports.

Mortgage brokers gather essential information and documents, including income, pay stubs, tax returns, and credit reports, to assess a consumer's financial situation. They then take this information to a bank or other lender for loan approval. Brokers are also responsible for communicating between borrowers and lenders during the application and approval process.

One significant advantage of working with a mortgage broker is that they can provide valuable insights, such as which lenders offer specific types of mortgages or which ones welcome applications for certain types of properties. Additionally, brokers can work with borrowers who have difficulty getting approved through direct lenders' automated underwriting process due to credit issues or other factors.

On the other hand, direct lenders are financial institutions or private entities that provide the loan for a mortgage. They may be banks and other financial institutions, or private companies that deal specifically with financing mortgage loans. The process of applying for a mortgage through a direct lender is similar to working with a mortgage broker, but the lender deals directly with the consumer.

Cutting out the middleman can make the loan process faster, and direct lenders may offer more competitive rates. However, skipping a mortgage broker may mean going through the application process with multiple direct lenders, which can be time-consuming and may result in multiple hits to your credit score.

Compensation is another key difference between mortgage brokers and direct lenders. Mortgage brokers are paid on a fee-based schedule, which can influence their advice and research. Some brokers work mainly with specific lenders, which could impact the choices they offer.

Ultimately, consumers aren't obligated to choose between mortgage brokers and direct lenders. They can compare rates and services to determine which route is best for them. It's essential to ask questions, such as what their rationale is for suggesting a specific lender, to ensure you're getting the best deal.

When deciding between a mortgage broker and a direct lender, consider your individual circumstances and needs. If you're looking for a one-stop-shop approach and access to multiple lenders, a mortgage broker may be the way to go. However, if you prefer to work directly with a lender and potentially secure a better rate, going directly to a lender could be the better option.

Invest wisely and explore your mortgage options thoroughly to find the best fit for your financial situation.

**Mortgage Brokers vs. Direct Lenders: Which is Right for You?**

Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism, specializing in personal finance and investing, as well as real estate.

When it comes to securing a mortgage, homebuyers often find themselves faced with two options: working with a mortgage broker or going directly to a lender. While both routes can lead to success, they differ in significant ways.

**What is a Mortgage Broker?**

A mortgage broker acts as an intermediary, connecting borrowers with lenders. They don't lend money themselves but instead help consumers comparison shop, bringing together multiple quotes from different lenders. To do this, a mortgage broker assesses the borrower's needs and financial situation, gathering essential documents and information to evaluate how much they can afford to borrow.

**How Do Mortgage Brokers Get Paid?**

Mortgage brokers are typically compensated on a fee-based schedule, with the loan origination fee paid by the lender. This can influence their advice and research, as they may favor certain lenders over others.

**The Benefits of Working with a Mortgage Broker**

Mortgage brokers offer a one-stop shop experience, providing access to multiple lenders and eliminating the need to visit multiple banks. This can result in a more competitive rate and fewer hits to your credit report. Brokers can also assist borrowers who have trouble getting approved through direct lenders' automated underwriting process due to factors like recent bankruptcy, poor credit, or unsteady employment.

**What is a Direct Lender?**

A direct lender, on the other hand, is a financial institution or private entity that provides the mortgage loan. This can include banks, online lenders, and private companies specializing in mortgage financing. Direct lenders cut out the middleman, allowing borrowers to communicate directly with the lender.

**The Benefits of Working with a Direct Lender**

Consumers who choose to work with a direct lender can enjoy a faster loan process, as they deal directly with the lender. This can also result in a better interest rate, especially for those with a pre-existing relationship with the lender. Additionally, direct lenders are often licensed nationwide, making them a great option for those buying a home in another state.

**The Drawbacks of Direct Lenders**

One significant drawback of working with a direct lender is that borrowers must apply individually with each lender, gathering documents and assessing their financial status without the assistance of a broker. Further, direct lenders have their own underwriting and loan terms, which can lead to application denial if issues arise.

**Which Option is Right for You?**

Ultimately, the decision between a mortgage broker and a direct lender depends on your individual circumstances and preferences. If you want a one-stop shop experience and assistance navigating the loan process, a mortgage broker may be the way to go. However, if you're comfortable dealing directly with a lender and want to potentially secure a better interest rate, a direct lender could be the better choice.

**Tips for Choosing the Right Mortgage Broker or Direct Lender**

Before making a decision, consider the following tips:

* Research and compare rates and fees to ensure you're getting the best deal.
* Ask about the lender's or broker's experience and reputation.
* Check for any hidden fees or charges.
* Consider working with a local mortgage broker or lender for a more personalized experience.

By understanding the differences between mortgage brokers and direct lenders, you can make an informed decision and secure the best possible mortgage for your needs.","Here is the final JSON style guide for NerdWallet:

0.376923076923077,"Stocks make excellent gifts for two reasons. First, compounding returns can work wonders for those who leave the stocks invested for a long time. Second, stocks are a great way to get others interested in finance and learning to invest. Here's how you can buy and gift stock.
You are allowed to give stocks that you own to others. You can start the process of gifting a stock online with your broker. Or you can transfer a stock certificate if you hold shares in physical form. You can transfer a single share, multiple shares, or all of your shares to a recipient if they also have a brokerage account.
Besides gifting stock you already own, another option is to buy a new stock and then transfer ownership of it to someone else. After making the purchase with your broker, you can initiate a transfer to the recipient's account, usually accomplished with a transfer authorization form. If the recipient's account is at a different broker from your own, also get in touch with the receiving institution to see what they require to make the transfer.
There's no limit on who can receive stock as a gift. It could be a family member, a friend, or your favorite charity.
Gifting shares of a company to children can be a great way to educate them about finance, saving, and building wealth for the future. For example, a child who likes Marvel, Star Wars, or Frozen might enjoy owning a share of parent company Disney (DIS  -0.15%). An avid video gamer could learn much from owning some shares of Nintendo (NTDOY  -2.61%). Besides benefiting from any future growth of the businesses, owning and reading about individual stocks provides lessons in business and economics.
There is a caveat here, though. Children are not allowed to own financial assets in most states, so you will have to open a custodial account, such as a Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA) or Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UTMA) account.
UTMA and UGMA accounts are managed by the custodian (you or the account manager you designate). They're typically transferred to the beneficiary when they turn 18 or 21. You also can open an account in your name or the legal guardian's name for the benefit of the child.
Gifting stock to your beneficiaries, rather than selling the stock and gifting cash, could be tax-efficient for both of you. For example, if you own stock with long-term capital gains, the tax owed on earnings in an eventual sale could be as high as 20%. If your beneficiary is in a lower tax bracket, their tax liability (if they sell the stock rather than keep it invested) would be lower. They could even have zero tax liability if they file their taxes as single and make less than $44,625 a year in taxable income (or less than $89,250 if married filing jointly) as of tax year 2023.
Any taxes you would normally owe when selling a stock do not apply if you decide to gift it instead. If there are any capital gains on stock you transfer to someone, that capital gain will transfer to the recipient.
Additionally, gifting stock to a charity could come with a tax deduction if you itemize your tax return (rather than take a standard deduction) and if the charity accepts such gifts. You'll want to check with your tax advisor on any limitations to the transfer and how much of a deduction you qualify for and get documentation from the charity that acknowledges the value. Because charities are tax-exempt, gifting stock (vs. selling it yourself, paying the tax, and then giving cash) could maximize the amount you are able to contribute toward their cause.
There is a limitation to consider when gifting stock. The IRS requires you to fill out a gift tax return if you give more than $17,000 per year of cash or property to any recipient as of tax year 2023. If you are married, each spouse is allowed to gift $17,000 per recipient and as much as $34,000 combined to any one individual.
There is no limit to how many individuals you can gift, but bear in mind that the $17,000 limit applies to each person to whom you give stock. Any value given over that amount counts against what's called your lifetime gift exclusion, which is $12.92 million per person for tax year 2023. As long as your excess gifts above $17,000 per year don't exceed $12.92 million in your lifetime, you don't have to worry about owing gift taxes.
Generally, there is no tax deduction for gifting cash or stock to individuals like there is when donating to charity.
Are you ready to jump into the stock market? We've got you.
Four figures can produce some great returns if invested in the right places.
When you decide which stock to give, start with those that have the most capital gains if you are also looking to limit your own tax liability down the road.
Gifting stock -- to a loved one for a special occasion, to a child as a way to build their appreciation for saving and investing, or as part of a tax strategy -- can be a better way to help others accomplish their financial goals than giving cash. And, because stocks have the potential to grow, they could be a gift that keeps on giving for a long time.
When you gift stock, you don't have to worry about capital gains tax. Recipients are responsible for any tax liability when they sell the stock.
Giving stock to family members has the same implications as giving to non-family members.
There are different ways to go about it. But one of the easiest ways to gift stocks is by transferring them from your brokerage account to their brokerage account. This can be particularly simple if you have brokerage accounts with the same company. But circumstances vary, and there may be a better way in your personal situation.
Yes, when you gift a stock, any capital gains tax liability is transferred from the giver to the recipient.

Coming up with good gift ideas isn't always straightforward. Younger children usually desire the latest fad (which they'll probably soon lose interest in), while older generations tend to buy what they need and can be difficult to satisfy.
In many ways, you can't go wrong with giving shares in a company as a gift. Sure, this may not generate as much excitement as, say, the latest PlayStation console or smartphone. However, stock is one of the few things that has a decent chance of growing in value, turning money into more money. There are few gifts in stores that have that attribute.
Buying gifts that adults actually want without breaking the bank is no easy task. But giving a share of company stock could perhaps help them one day generate enough money to purchase that one thing they don't have and have always wanted.
For kids, it's a slightly harder sell because they may not have any long-term dream for which they're actively saving up. But that's bound to change at some point in the future, and learning about managing money and investing early can serve them well later in life.
There are many companies out there, and choosing the right stock(s) requires careful consideration. The goal is to make this gift as compelling and profitable as possible, so you’ll want to consider the interests of the person for whom you are buying, as well as the growth potential.
Consider what the recipient likes, and find a company that operates in that area. Then go through its accounts, apply some valuation metrics, or speak to an advisor to determine if it would make a good investment. Your best bet would be to draw up a shortlist of several companies first and then analyze each until you find one that is attractively priced and poised to grow in value for years to come.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a great way to gift multiple stocks in one transaction. You can choose index-based ETFs, such as SPY, IVV, or VOO, among many others, all of which track the Standard & Poor's 500 (an index of 500 large U.S. companies). Or you can choose a sector-based ETF that reflects the interests of your gift recipient. A young one might be interested in planes, for instance, and there is a specific ETF that contains major airline stocks: JETS.
There is virtually an ETF for most any sector or asset class, which should make your decision a lot easier. You can search the web for a specific ETF that covers the sector, region, or index that might be interesting to your gift recipient, and you're likely to find many selections to choose from. Also, to make ETFs even more attractive, they function like regular shares and can be bought and sold on a fractional basis (see below), too.
You might find that buying even one share in a company is more than you can afford or want to spend. In this case, fractional shares—if available—may be your best option.
When they go public, companies issue a set number of shares, each of which represents a portion of ownership. However, it is sometimes possible to buy a slice of one share or stock, called a fractional share, and to essentially invest a dollar amount of your choosing in a given company. Unless you are feeling especially generous, this may be a necessary option for higher-priced shares.
Many online brokerages permit investors to buy fractional shares for as little as $1 to $10.
In short, the goal is to make as much money as possible by investing in companies that are deemed good for society. Obviously, going the ESG route means limiting your choice of available investments. However, there's also the argument that using an ESG-based screening process to select stocks will result in investment in companies that are at a lower risk of being hit by big scandals that damage their share prices.
Before taking the leap and buying your loved ones a company's stock as gifts, it's important to be aware of any present or future tax bills. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) might charge you for making the gift if it's a large one. The recipient—if all goes according to plan and the stock's value increases—also will be expected to pay capital gains tax when they eventually decide to cash in on your present.
Like ordinary income tax, capital gains rates become steeper as an individual's income for the tax year grows.
If you plan to give stock to a minor, you can set up a custodial account on their behalf. You'll then be in charge of the stock held in the account until the child reaches a certain age, usually 18 or 21. Hopefully by then, the beneficiary will be mature enough to manage their own finances and make smart investment decisions.
Absolutely. The owner of company stocks is permitted to transfer ownership without incurring any penalties. The process is fairly straightforward. Online brokers usually provide an option to make a transfer on their platforms. All you need to do is give your written consent and basically fill out some forms.
Physical share certificates, too, can change hands. To complete this type of transaction, you'll need to get in touch with the company's transfer agent, whose contact information should be visible in the investor relations section of the company's website.
Looking for a gift for someone's birthday or for the holidays but coming up short on ideas? You might want to consider giving a gift of stock. You'd be giving a present that has the potential to grow in value over the years, and not many gifts can offer that.
It's easy to give a gift of stock, through your brokerage account, directly with a share transfer, or from the company itself. With thousands of stocks, it can be hard to decide which to choose. If that's the case, you might want to consider ETFs, which are baskets of multiple stocks represented by a single share or more. Also, consider using fractional shares to give a portion of an expensive stock or simply to give a gift based on a dollar amount.
There are unlikely to be any immediate tax consequences in giving a gift of stock. More likely, the tax considerations would come when the shares are sold in the future.

Stock Gifting: A Tax-Efficient Way to Share Wealth and Financial Knowledge

Stocks can make excellent gifts, offering a unique opportunity to share wealth and financial knowledge with loved ones. One of the primary advantages of gifting stocks is the potential for compounding returns, which can work wonders for recipients who hold onto the investment for the long haul. Additionally, gifting stocks can educate others about finance, saving, and building wealth for the future.

Gifting Stocks: A Step-by-Step Guide

Gifting stocks is a relatively straightforward process. You can transfer existing shares from your brokerage account to the recipient's account, either online or by transferring a physical stock certificate. Alternatively, you can purchase new shares and then transfer ownership to the recipient. To complete the transfer, you'll need to initiate a transfer authorization form and, if necessary, coordinate with the receiving institution.

Gifting Stocks to Children: A Valuable Learning Experience

Gifting shares to children can be a great way to teach them about finance, saving, and building wealth. For example, a child who loves Marvel, Star Wars, or Frozen might appreciate owning a share of parent company Disney. To facilitate this, you'll need to open a custodial account, such as a Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA) or Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) account. These accounts are typically managed by a custodian (you or the account manager you designate) and are transferred to the beneficiary when they turn 18 or 21.

Tax-Efficient Gifting: Minimizing Capital Gains

Gifting stocks can be a tax-efficient way to share wealth, especially when compared to selling the stock and gifting cash. When you gift stock, you avoid capital gains tax, and the recipient inherits the tax liability. If the recipient is in a lower tax bracket, their tax liability will be lower, potentially even zero. Additionally, gifting stock to a charity can come with a tax deduction, making it a more effective way to contribute to their cause.

Gifting Stock: Limitations and Considerations

While gifting stock can be a valuable tool for sharing wealth and knowledge, there are some limitations to consider. The IRS requires a gift tax return if you gift more than $17,000 per year to any individual. There is no limit to the number of individuals you can gift, but bear in mind that the $17,000 limit applies to each person. Any excess gifts above this amount count against your lifetime gift exclusion, which is $12.92 million per person for tax year 2023.

In conclusion, gifting stocks can be a thoughtful and tax-efficient way to share wealth and financial knowledge with loved ones. By understanding the process and considering the tax implications, you can make the most of this unique gifting opportunity.

Ready to jump into the stock market? With the right guidance, four figures can produce significant returns. When selecting a stock to gift, consider those with the most capital gains to minimize your own tax liability down the road.

Stocks as Gifts: A Smart and Educational Option

When it comes to finding the perfect gift, it's often the thought that counts. One unique and potentially lucrative option is to give stocks as gifts. Not only can this spark an interest in finance and investing, but it can also provide a potential long-term source of wealth.

Gifting stocks can be a great way to introduce children or loved ones to the world of investing. For example, a child who loves Marvel or Star Wars might enjoy owning a share of Disney (DIS). An avid video gamer could learn much from owning some shares of Nintendo (NTDOY). Beyond the potential for future growth, owning and reading about individual stocks provides valuable lessons in business and economics.

To gift stocks, you can transfer ownership of shares you already own or buy new shares and then transfer them to the recipient's account. There is no limit on who can receive stock as a gift, but children are not allowed to own financial assets in most states, so you'll need to open a custodial account, such as a Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA) or Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UTMA) account. These accounts are managed by the custodian until the beneficiary reaches the age of 18 or 21.

Gifting stock can also be a tax-efficient strategy for both you and the recipient. If you own stock with long-term capital gains, gifting it instead of selling it can avoid capital gains taxes. Additionally, if the recipient is in a lower tax bracket, their tax liability on any future sale will be lower.

When choosing which stocks to gift, consider the recipient's interests and values. For example, you could choose a company that aligns with their passion for the environment or social justice. You could also consider gifting index funds or ETFs, which provide diversification and can be a lower-cost option.

In conclusion, gifting stocks can be a thoughtful and educational way to introduce others to the world of investing. Not only can it provide a potential source of wealth, but it can also spark an interest in finance and economics. By considering the recipient's interests and values, you can choose a gift that will be both meaningful and potentially lucrative.

0.375438596491228,"Bonds usually can be purchased from a bond broker through full service or discount brokerage channels, similar to the way stocks are purchased from a stockbroker.
While the presence of online brokerage services has brought investing costs down, dealing with a bond broker can still be prohibitive to some retail investors.
Many specialized bond brokerages require high minimum initial deposits; $5,000 is typical. There may also be account maintenance fees. And of course, commissions on trades. Depending on the quantity and type of bond purchased, broker commissions can range from 0.5% to 2%.
When using a broker (even your regular one) to purchase bonds, you may be told that the trade is free of commission. What often happens, however, is that the price is marked up so that the cost you are charged essentially includes a compensatory fee. If the broker isn't earning anything off of the transaction, they probably would not offer the service.
For example, say you placed an order for 10 corporate bonds that were trading at $1,025 per bond. You'd be told, though, that they cost $1,035.25 per bond, so the total price of your investment comes not to $10,250 but to $10,352.50. The difference represents an effective 1% commission for the broker.
To determine the markup before purchase, look up the latest quote for the bond; you can also use the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), which shows all over-the-counter (OTC) transactions for the secondary bond market. Use your discretion to decide whether or not the commission fee is excessive or one you are willing to accept.
Purchasing government bonds such as Treasuries (U.S.) or Canada Savings Bonds (Canada) works slightly differently than buying corporate or municipal bonds. Many financial institutions provide services to their clients that allow them to purchase government bonds through their regular investment accounts. If this service is not available to you through your bank or brokerage, you also have the option to purchase these securities directly from the government.
In the U.S., for example, Treasury bonds and bills (T-bonds and T-bills) can be purchased through TreasuryDirect. Sponsored by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service, TreasuryDirect lets individual investors buy, sell and hold Treasury Bills, Notes, Bonds, Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), and Series I and Series EE Savings Bonds in paperless form via electronic accounts. No fees or commissions are charged, but you must have a Social Security number or U.S. Taxpayer Identification Number, a U.S. address, and a U.S. bank account to purchase via the site.
Another way to gain exposure in bonds would be to invest in a bond fund (a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF)) that exclusively holds bonds in its portfolio. These funds are convenient since they are usually low-cost and contain a broad base of diversified bonds so you don't need to do your research to identify specific issues.
When buying and selling these funds (or, for that matter, bonds themselves on the open market), keep in mind that these are “secondary market” transactions, meaning that you are buying from another investor and not directly from the issuer. One drawback of mutual funds and ETFs is that investors do not know the maturity of all the bonds in the fund portfolio since they are changing quite often, and therefore these investment vehicles are not appropriate for an investor who wishes to hold a bond until maturity.
Another drawback of mutual funds is that you will have to pay additional fees to the portfolio managers, though bond funds tend to have lower expense ratios than their equity counterparts. Passively managed bond ETFs, which track a bond index, tend to have the fewest expenses of all.
In addition to the Treasury, corporate, and municipal bonds described above, there are many other bonds that can be used strategically in a well-diversified, income-generating portfolio. Analyzing the yield of these bonds relative to U.S. Treasuries and relative to comparable bonds of the same type and maturity is key to understanding their risks.
Like most other countries, the two most common types of bonds in the U.K. are government and corporate ones.
Another option is to invest in a fund holding a portfolio of U.K. government bonds. Some funds specialize specifically in U.K. gilts. Others may mix them with government bonds from other countries or perhaps corporate bonds.
Investing individually in a suitable number of U.K. corporate bonds can be quite expensive. In fact, most retail investors find it better and more affordable to invest in a range of them via an ETF or other fund instead.
Today, many online brokerage platforms make buying bonds of all types easy and cost-efficient. Therefore, finding the right bonds for your portfolio is key. Depending on your investment goals, tax exposure, risk tolerance, and time horizon, different types of bonds will be most appropriate for you. Most of these platforms will also have tools to screen the universe of bonds and filter based on various criteria such as credit rating, maturity, type of issuer, and yield.
U.S. Treasury bonds are frequently used as a benchmark for other bond prices or yields. Any bond's price is best understood by also looking at its yield. As a measure of relative value, the yields of most bonds are quoted as a yield spread to a comparable U.S. Treasury bond.
If you're willing to give up some yield in exchange for a risk-free portfolio, you can use Treasury bonds to structure a portfolio with coupon payments and maturities that match your income needs. The key is to minimize your reinvestment risk by matching those coupon payments and maturities as closely as possible to your income needs.
A bond ladder is a strategy that attempts to minimize these risks associated with fixed-income securities while managing cash flows for the individual investor. In a bond ladder, the bonds' maturity dates are evenly spaced across several months or several years so that the proceeds are reinvested at regular intervals as the bonds mature. By staggering maturity dates, you won't be locked into one bond for a long duration.
You can buy munis from your online broker or through a brokerage firm that specializes in municipal bonds. Be sure to check that you will qualify for tax-free status based on your residency.
U.S> government savings bonds can only be purchased online using the TreasuryDirect website. You may also be able to use your federal income tax refund to purchase savings bonds.
Depending on your brokerage's capabilities and access to international debt markets, you may be able to purchase foreign bonds much the same way as domestic ones. International bond mutual funds and ETFs are also available to trade.
A bearer bond is a fixed-income security that is owned by the holder, or bearer, rather than by a registered owner. Bearer bonds are virtually non-existent anymore as the lack of registration made them ideal for use in money laundering, tax evasion, and any number of other under-handed transactions. They also are vulnerable to theft.
A well-diversified portfolio should include investments in bonds, and most brokers today allow for easy access to the bond market, either directly or via bond mutual funds or ETFs. But, the bond market can be complex and overwhelming if taken as a whole. Depending on your investment goals, tax exposure, risk tolerance, and time horizon, different types of bonds will be most appropriate for you. Knowing the risks and features of each type of bond can help you understand when and how much of that asset class to add to your portfolio.

Buying and holding to maturity is one strategy for investing in bonds. Another is to sell early and make a profit.

Many financial planners advocate investing a portion of your portfolio in bonds because of their lower volatility and relative safety compared with stocks. A quick way to get exposure is with bond funds, either mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which investors can purchase through most major brokerages.
when you open and fund an account with Webull.
Buying bonds can prove a little trickier than buying stocks, because of the initial amount required to begin investing. While the face value of most bonds is $1,000, there are ways to buy bonds for less. The easiest ways to buy bonds are through a broker, an ETF or directly from the U.S. government in increments of $100.
You can buy bonds from an online broker — learn how to open a brokerage account to get started. Through this approach, you’ll be buying bonds from other investors looking to sell. You may also be able to receive a discount off the bond’s face value by buying a bond directly from the underwriting investment bank in an initial bond offering.
An ETF typically buys bonds from many different companies, and some funds are focused on short-, medium-, and long-term bonds, or provide exposure to certain industries or markets. A fund is a great option for individual investors because it provides immediate diversification and you don’t have to buy in large increments.
A bond’s term refers to the length of time until the bond matures. One important difference between short- and long-term bonds is that longer-term bonds tend to offer higher interest rates due to their greater interest rate risk. In other words, it’s more likely that long-term bonds will be exposed and sensitive to interest rate changes over a longer time period.
The federal government has set up a program on the Treasury Direct website so investors can buy government bonds directly without having to pay a fee to a broker or other middleman.
There are two ways to earn income when investing in bonds. One strategy is to buy and hold the bond until it matures, and then collect the principal and interest.
If the bond price appreciates from when you purchased it, however, another strategy is to sell it early and make a profit. A bond’s price can go up if the borrower’s credit rating improves or if the interest rates fall. Bond prices have an inverse relationship to interest rates, meaning when interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and visa versa.
The answer to this question is paramount, because if a company can’t pay its bonds — its promise to pay back money lent, with interest — there’s no reason for the average investor to consider buying them. With some sleuthing, you can estimate whether the company is able to meet its debt obligations.
Bonds are rated by ratings agencies, with three big ones dominating the industry: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. They estimate creditworthiness, assigning credit ratings to companies and governments and the bonds they issue. The higher the rating — AAA is the highest, and it goes down from there, like school grades — the greater the likelihood the company will honor its obligations and the lower the interest rates it will have to pay.
Corporate bonds. Beyond ratings, the quickest way to determine the safety of a company-issued bond is by looking at how much interest a company pays relative to its income. Corporate bonds generally pay higher interest than government bonds because they have a relatively higher risk of default. Like a homeowner paying off a mortgage every month, if the company doesn’t have the income to support its payments, there will be trouble eventually.
Start with the company’s most recent annual operating income and interest expense, which can be found on a company's income statement. This info is available for every U.S. publicly traded company in a 10-K filing, available on a company's website or in the EDGAR database on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's website. Operating income differs from net income, because it factors out interest payments (which are tax-deductible) and taxes, and is the best measure of a company’s ability to pay its debts.
Government bonds. Evaluating government-issued bonds is a bit trickier because governments don't typically carry huge excess revenues that indicate stability. The good news? Government bonds generally are safer for investment, with those issued by the U.S. federal government deemed the world's safest and rated AAA.
U.S. government bonds are often referred to as Treasury Bonds or T-bonds, and are considered so safe that investors refer to the government's interest rate as the ""risk-free rate."" As a result, government bonds do not usually offer higher interest rates given the low risk of default. Two exceptions are Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and I bonds, whose interest rates are adjusted regularly based on inflation. I bonds were offering rates above 5% as of Dec. 18, 2023[1]TreasuryDirect. I bond interest rates. Accessed Nov 8, 2022.View all sources.
Municipal bonds. Bonds issued by cities, states and municipalities, though they've also been safe historically, are not quite so rock solid. You can investigate these bonds further on the Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) site, which provides a bond's official prospectus, an issuer's audited financial statements and ongoing financial disclosures, including payment delinquencies and defaults.
A government's credit rating is a good first guide to its creditworthiness, and you can follow up to see if there are any recent defaults or other financial issues that might cause a future default or delinquency. Another benefit: Income from municipal bonds is generally tax free at the federal level, and sometimes even at the state level, if you purchase them in the state where you reside.
Zero-coupon bonds are bonds that do not pay interest, and are also known as “deep discount” bonds. They are sold at a reduced price compared to their face value, and a profit is made when the bond is held to maturity. Treasury or T bills are an example of a zero-coupon bond.
Once a bond’s interest rate is set and made available to investors, the bond trades in what’s called the debt market. Then the moves of prevailing interest rates dictate how the bond’s price fluctuates.
Bond prices tend to move countercyclically. As the economy heats up, interest rates rise, depressing bond prices. As the economy cools, interest rates fall, lifting bond prices. You might think that bonds are a great buy during boom times (when prices are lowest) and a sell when the economy starts to recover. But it’s not that simple.
Investors try to predict whether rates will go higher or lower. But waiting to buy bonds can amount to trying to time the market, which is not considered a good idea.
To manage this uncertainty, many bond investors “ladder” their bond exposure. Investors buy numerous bonds that mature across a period of years. As bonds mature, the principal is reinvested and the ladder grows. Laddering effectively diversifies interest-rate risk, though it may come at the cost of lower yield.
The type of bonds that might be right for you depend on several factors, including your risk tolerance, tax situation and time horizon, as well as when you need income from these bonds, if ever.
A good bond allocation might include each type -- corporate, federal and municipal bonds -- which will help diversify the portfolio and reduce principal risk. Investors can also stagger the maturities to reduce interest-rate risk.
Diversifying a bond portfolio can be difficult because bonds typically are sold in $1,000 increments, so it can take a lot of cash to build a diversified portfolio.
Instead, it’s much easier to buy bond ETFs. These funds can provide diversified exposure to the bond types you want, and you can mix and match bond ETFs even if you can’t invest a large amount at once. Broadening your exposure also provides the benefit of decreasing the risk you face by not placing all your eggs in one basket.

Bonds: A Smart Investment Choice, But Be Aware of the Fees

When it comes to investing in bonds, many people turn to a bond broker, similar to how they would work with a stockbroker to purchase stocks. However, dealing with a bond broker can come with some hefty fees, especially for retail investors.

Many specialized bond brokerages require a significant initial investment, often around $5,000, and may also charge account maintenance fees. And, of course, there are commissions on trades, which can range from 0.5% to 2% depending on the quantity and type of bond purchased.

But here's the thing: even if your broker tells you that the trade is free of commission, the price may be marked up to include a compensatory fee. For example, if you purchase 10 corporate bonds at $1,025 per bond, you might be told that the price is actually $1,035.25 per bond, which means you're paying an effective 1% commission.

To avoid getting caught off guard by these fees, it's essential to do your research and look up the latest quote for the bond before making a purchase. You can also use the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) to get a better sense of the prices in the secondary bond market.

Investing in Government Bonds: A Different Story

When it comes to government bonds, such as U.S. Treasury bonds or Canada Savings Bonds, the process is slightly different. Many financial institutions offer services that allow you to purchase these bonds through your regular investment account. If this option isn't available to you, you can also purchase them directly from the government.

For instance, in the U.S., you can buy Treasury bonds and bills through TreasuryDirect, a service sponsored by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The best part? No fees or commissions are charged, as long as you have a Social Security number or U.S. Taxpayer Identification Number, a U.S. address, and a U.S. bank account.

Bond Funds: A Convenient Option

Another way to invest in bonds is through a bond fund, which is a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that exclusively holds bonds in its portfolio. These funds are often low-cost and offer a broad base of diversified bonds, so you don't need to do your research to identify specific issues.

However, keep in mind that when you buy and sell these funds, you're buying from another investor and not directly from the issuer. This means that the pricing may not be as transparent as you'd like. Additionally, mutual funds and ETFs often come with additional fees, and you may not know the exact maturity of the bonds in the fund portfolio.

Understanding the Risks and Features of Bonds

When it comes to investing in bonds, it's essential to understand the risks and features of each type. Analyzing the yield of these bonds relative to U.S. Treasuries and comparable bonds of the same type and maturity is key to understanding their risks.

In the U.K., for example, government bonds and corporate bonds are the two most common types of bonds. You can invest in these bonds individually or through a fund that holds a portfolio of U.K. government bonds. However, investing individually in a suitable number of U.K. corporate bonds can be quite expensive, and many retail investors find it better to invest in a range of them via an ETF or other fund instead.

With the rise of online brokerage platforms, buying bonds has become easier and more cost-efficient than ever. The key is to find the right bonds for your portfolio, taking into account your investment goals, tax exposure, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Most online brokerage platforms also offer tools to screen the universe of bonds and filter based on various criteria such as credit rating, maturity, type of issuer, and yield.

In conclusion, bonds can be a smart investment choice, but it's essential to be aware of the fees and risks involved. By doing your research and understanding the features of each type of bond, you can make informed investment decisions that align with your financial goals.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of NerdWallet:

**Investing in Bonds: A Beginner's Guide**

When it comes to investing, bonds are often overlooked in favor of more glamorous options like stocks. But bonds can be a vital part of a diversified portfolio, providing a steady stream of income and relatively low risk.

**How to Buy Bonds**

Bonds can be purchased through a broker, an ETF, or directly from the U.S. government. The easiest way to buy bonds is through an online broker, which allows you to purchase bonds from other investors looking to sell. You can also buy bonds directly from the U.S. government in increments of $100.

**Understanding Bond Ratings**

Before investing in a bond, it's essential to check its credit rating. Bond ratings are assigned by ratings agencies like Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch, and they estimate the creditworthiness of the borrower. A higher rating indicates a lower risk of default, while a lower rating indicates a higher risk.

**Types of Bonds**

There are several types of bonds to consider, including corporate bonds, government bonds, and municipal bonds. Corporate bonds are issued by companies and typically offer higher interest rates than government bonds due to their higher risk of default. Government bonds, on the other hand, are considered to be very low-risk and are often used as a benchmark for other bond prices. Municipal bonds are issued by cities, states, and municipalities and offer tax-free income at the federal level, and sometimes even at the state level.

**Bond Ladders**

One strategy for investing in bonds is to create a bond ladder. This involves buying multiple bonds with staggered maturity dates, which helps to diversify interest-rate risk and provides a steady stream of income. As bonds mature, the principal is reinvested, and the ladder grows.

**Diversifying Your Bond Portfolio**

Diversifying a bond portfolio can be challenging due to the high minimum investment requirements. However, bond ETFs can provide a convenient way to gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of bonds without having to invest a large amount of money upfront.

**Conclusion**

Investing in bonds can be a great way to add diversity to your portfolio and reduce risk. By understanding the different types of bonds, bond ratings, and investment strategies, you can make informed decisions about how to invest in bonds. Remember to diversify your portfolio and consider using bond ETFs to gain exposure to a broad range of bonds.

0.375,"Last week, the fintech company Petal added a new credit card to its portfolio, the Petal 1 card. Like the original Petal Visa Card—now referred to as the Petal 2—the new card is for people with less-than-stellar credit. However, some of the terms are less appealing than the Petal 2's, and the company has also made it more challenging to get approved for the older card.
The new Petal 1 card is designed for people who have low to fair credit scores or cash flow. The card has no annual or foreign transaction fees, but it may charge late or returned payment fees.
The Petal 1 also offers cash back rewards, but only with select merchants through the Petal Offers feature. These merchant offers are automatically added to your account, and once you meet the requirements, you’ll earn between 2% and 10% back. That said, you won’t get an ongoing rewards rate on other purchases you make.
The card comes with credit limits of from $500 to $5,000, depending on your ability to pay, previous credit limits, credit history, and other variables.
Most importantly, the Petal 1 doesn’t require a security deposit, which is common with many credit cards for bad credit. So if you’re just starting to build credit or you’ve made some mistakes in the past, the Petal 1 could be an excellent and economical choice.
Petal made a huge splash in the credit card industry in 2018 when it launched its first credit card. The Petal Visa Card—now the Petal 2—made it possible for people with no credit or a limited credit history to get approved based on how they manage their money.
During the application process, people link their bank account to Petal to show their income and expenses, which Petal then uses to create a “cash score.” The company relies on this information alongside (or without) your credit score to make a decision.
Unlike many cards for people with lower credit scores, the original Petal card also offered an impressive array of features, including up to 1.5% cash back and no fees whatsoever.
The Petal 1 card has taken its place in terms of that target audience, while the Petal 2 card is now targeted at people with fair to good credit scores or cash flow. That will make it harder for some people to get.
The good news is that Petal 1 cardholders can graduate to the Petal 2 after they show responsible card use over time. Until then, the Petal 1 is still a solid credit-building alternative to credit cards that charge high fees or require upfront security deposits.

Some Petal 2 cardholders, meanwhile, were told they would be shifted to a variation of the Petal® 1 Rise Visa® Credit Card, also with an $8 monthly fee but with the same cash-back rewards as the Petal 2. Petal indicated on its website that these changes applied only to select existing cardholders and not new accounts.

The Petal® 1 ""No Annual Fee"" Visa® Credit Card is for those with less-than-perfect credit or cash flow who have goals to improve their credit scores. Unlike its sibling, this card charges fees if you incur them and it earns fewer incentives on purchases. It's one of NerdWallet's best credit cards for fair credit.
The Petal® 2 ""Cash Back, No Fees"" Visa® Credit Card is for people with a better credit score or a stronger cash flow. Like the name suggests, this card doesn’t charge any fees — even late fees — and is a solid option if you want that added safety net. It also offers more ongoing incentives for purchases and on-time payments.
A late payment fee of up to $40 if incurred.
A returned payment fee of up to $29 if incurred.

With good to excellent credit (a credit score of 690 or higher) you may qualify for a cash-back credit card that can offer more long-term value. But if you value skipping fees, the Petal® 2 ""Cash Back, No Fees"" Visa® Credit Card is still a good option.
If you're not eligible for a Petal card, you still have other options for unlocking the door to credit. Some cards are easier to get, such as those that require a security deposit or those that don’t allow ongoing balances from one month to another. Explore your options and choose the card that best aligns with your income, credit history and spending habits.

Petal Unveils New Credit Card for Those with Less-Than-Stellar Credit

The world of credit cards can be a daunting one, especially for those with limited or no credit history. That's why fintech company Petal made waves in 2018 with the launch of its first credit card, designed specifically for people with no credit or a limited credit history. And now, Petal has added a new card to its portfolio: the Petal 1 card.

The Petal 1 card is geared towards individuals with low to fair credit scores or cash flow. While it doesn't offer the same level of perks as its predecessor, the Petal 2, it still presents an attractive option for those looking to build credit without breaking the bank. With no annual or foreign transaction fees, the Petal 1 is a solid choice for those just starting out or looking to rebuild their credit.

One of the standout features of the Petal 1 is its cash back rewards program, which offers between 2% and 10% back on select merchant purchases. However, it's worth noting that these rewards are only available through the Petal Offers feature, and there's no ongoing rewards rate for other purchases.

In terms of credit limits, the Petal 1 offers a range of $500 to $5,000, depending on your ability to pay, previous credit limits, credit history, and other variables. And, unlike many credit cards for bad credit, the Petal 1 doesn't require a security deposit, making it a more accessible option for those looking to build credit.

Petal's original credit card, now rebranded as the Petal 2, was a game-changer in the credit card industry. By allowing people to link their bank account to Petal and showcasing their income and expenses, the company was able to create a ""cash score"" that could be used to make credit decisions. This innovative approach enabled people with no credit or limited credit history to get approved for credit.

Fast-forward to today, and the Petal 1 card has taken its place as the go-to option for those with less-than-stellar credit. Meanwhile, the Petal 2 card is now targeted towards individuals with fair to good credit scores or cash flow. While this may make it more challenging for some to get approved, the good news is that Petal 1 cardholders can graduate to the Petal 2 after demonstrating responsible card use over time.

In today's world of credit cards, it's more important than ever to have options that cater to a range of credit profiles. With the Petal 1 card, Petal is offering a solid credit-building alternative to credit cards that charge exorbitant fees or require upfront security deposits.

0.362068965517241,"With most stocks, taxation is fairly straightforward. Company profits are subject to corporate taxes and dividends paid are typically subject to qualified dividend tax rates.
When it comes to real estate investment trusts, or REITs, taxation is a bit more complicated. Not only can REITs avoid corporate tax altogether, but REIT dividends have a complex tax treatment you should know about before buying shares.
Here's a quick guide to REIT taxation and how investors should invest if they want to avoid the tax complications that come with REIT investing.
When it comes to stock investing, there are two types of taxation you should know.
First, there are individual taxes that you'll pay on dividends and capital gains tax you pay when you sell for a profit.
Second, there are corporate taxes which may be assessed on a company's profits before the company distributes income to shareholders. These are only indirectly related to your earnings, but they're worth considering.
REIT taxation is a special case. In exchange for meeting certain requirements -- in particular, paying at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends -- REITs pay no corporate tax whatsoever.
Instead, REITs are treated in the same manner as pass-through business entities like LLCs, partnerships, and S-corporations. This is one of the biggest tax advantages of REIT investing.
While the lack of corporate tax is certainly a perk, REITs aren't tax-advantaged investments in every way. Especially when it comes to dividends. REIT dividends typically don't qualify for the favorable tax treatment most stock dividends do. And their dividends can be rather complex. Specifically, there are three main types of distributions REITs make -- ordinary income, long-term capital gains, and return of capital -- and each one has a different tax treatment.
Most of the money distributed by REITs is considered ordinary income. Generally speaking, any distributed operating profit is considered to be an ordinary dividend. This is important for REIT taxation.
For the most part, REIT dividends don't meet the definition of a ""qualified"" dividend, which is taxed as a capital gain. In a nutshell, this means REIT income taxation is at your marginal tax rate, or tax bracket.
Ordinary income generally makes up the bulk of REIT distributions and taxation, but it's not uncommon to see some portion labeled as a long-term capital gain. This occurs when a REIT sells a property that it has owned for over a year and chose to distribute that income to shareholders.
Long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income and short-term gains. The long-term capital gains rates in the U.S. are currently 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on the taxpayer's income, but are always lower than the corresponding marginal tax rate for ordinary income.
Finally, some portion of a REIT's distribution could be considered a return of investor capital, which isn't taxable -- at least not immediately.
A return of capital lowers the investor's cost basis in an asset. In other words, if you paid $50 per share for a REIT, and it distributed $1 as a non-taxable return of capital, your cost basis (the price you effectively paid) would be reduced to $49. So, while this won't result in a tax bill for the distribution, it can make your capital gains tax bill higher when you eventually sell the REIT shares.
Shortly after the end of each calendar year, REITs issue a tax notice to shareholders. That notice provides details about the classification of the distributions paid out during the year. This information can also typically be found on the tax documents your broker sends you.
Let's say you owned 100 shares of Welltower in 2021. That would have paid you $244 in total distributions. Of those distributions, $148.28 would be taxable as ordinary income, although this amount would also potentially be eligible for the pass-through deduction. Another $83.71 would be taxable at the favorable long-term capital gains tax rates. And $12.01 wouldn't be taxable at all, but your cost basis in the REIT would be lowered by this amount.
As if REIT dividends weren't complicated enough, they might also qualify for the pass-through tax deduction that was created as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This deduction (the Section 199A Qualified Business Income deduction) allows taxpayers with pass-through income to deduct up to 20% of this amount from their taxable income. And REIT dividends qualify. Sort of.
Notice in the last example how the ordinary dividend is also labeled as a Section 199A distribution. This portion of the distribution is eligible for the deduction, as it's the only part that's taxable at ordinary income tax rates.
Since REITs not only tend to have above-average dividend yields but are also taxed at higher rates and can be quite complex, they're perhaps the best type of dividend stock to hold in tax-advantaged retirement accounts like IRAs.
If you own REITs in an IRA, you won't have to worry about dividend taxes each year, nor will you have to pay taxes in the year in which you sell a REIT at a profit. In a traditional IRA, you won't owe any taxes until you withdraw money from the account. In a Roth IRA, as long as your withdrawals meet the IRS requirements, you'll never pay taxes.
It's not necessarily a bad idea to own REITs in taxable brokerage accounts. But because of complex REIT taxation rules, they certainly make more sense in IRAs. This way, the REITs avoid taxation on the corporate level and you can defer or avoid taxes on the individual level, as well.

These payments can constitute ordinary income, capital gains, or a return of capital—each of which receives different tax treatment. Below, we explain how REITs work and what investors should know about the potential tax implications.
A REIT is a company that owns, operates or finances income-producing real estate. They are similar to mutual funds, in that REITs pool together capital from a large number of investors. This money is then used to invest in property such as office buildings, apartment complexes, shopping malls, industrial estates, hotels and resorts etc. REITs make it possible to invest in real estate without the hassles that come with owning property, such dealing with leases and property upkeep. Each unit in a REIT represents proportional ownership of the underlying properties.
REITs are popular investment vehicles around the world. Globally, REITs are available in as many as 37 countries and have surpassed $1.7 trillion in market capitalization.2 In the United States, REITs are required to pay at least 90% of taxable income to unitholders.1 This makes REITs attractive to investors seeking higher yields than what can be earned in traditional fixed-income markets.
An investor buys a REIT currently trading at $20 per unit. The REIT generates $2 per unit from operations and distributes 90% (or $1.80) to unitholders. Of this, $1.20 of the dividend comes from earnings. The remaining $0.60 comes from depreciation and other expenses and is considered a nontaxable return of capital.
The investor would pay ordinary income taxes on the $1.20 in the year in which it was received. Meanwhile, the investor's cost basis is reduced by $0.60 to $19.40 per share. As stated previously, this reduction in basis will be taxed as a either long- or short-term gain or loss when the units are sold.
REITs provide unique tax advantages that can translate into a steady stream of income for investors and higher yields than what they might earn in fixed-income markets. However, investors should know whether these payments are in the form of income, capital gains or a return of capital, as each is treated differently at tax time. Furthermore, qualified REIT dividends may enjoy additional tax breaks under TCJA.5﻿ As each person's tax situation is different, investors should consult with their own financial advisor to understand how REIT dividends will impact their tax obligations.

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): A Complex Taxation Landscape

Investors seeking to add real estate to their portfolios often turn to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), a popular investment vehicle offering an attractive dividend yield. However, REITs are subject to a unique taxation framework that differs significantly from that of traditional stocks. Understanding the intricacies of REIT taxation is crucial for investors to maximize their returns and minimize their tax liabilities.

In contrast to traditional corporations, REITs avoid paying corporate taxes altogether, provided they distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends. This tax exemption is a significant benefit for REIT investors. Instead, REITs are treated as pass-through entities, similar to limited liability companies (LLCs), partnerships, and S-corporations.

However, REIT dividends are not entirely tax-advantaged. Unlike qualified dividends from traditional stocks, REIT dividends are typically taxed as ordinary income, subject to the investor's marginal tax rate. Furthermore, REIT distributions can be complex, consisting of three primary components: ordinary income, long-term capital gains, and return of capital.

Ordinary income, which accounts for the majority of REIT distributions, is taxed at the individual's marginal tax rate. Long-term capital gains, resulting from the sale of properties held for over a year, are taxed at a lower rate – 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on the taxpayer's income level. Finally, the return of capital, which reduces the investor's cost basis in the REIT, is not immediately taxable but may lead to higher capital gains tax liabilities upon sale.

Each year, REITs issue a tax notice to shareholders, detailing the classification of distributions paid out during the year. This information can also be found on the tax documents provided by the investor's broker. For instance, if an investor owned 100 shares of Welltower in 2021, they would have received a total distribution of $244, comprising $148.28 in taxable ordinary income, $83.71 in long-term capital gains, and $12.01 in non-taxable return of capital.

Additionally, REIT dividends may qualify for the pass-through tax deduction, established as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This deduction allows taxpayers with pass-through income to deduct up to 20% of this amount from their taxable income. However, the complexity of REIT taxation makes it advantageous to hold these investments in tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs).

By holding REITs in an IRA, investors can avoid dividend taxes each year and defer or avoid capital gains taxes upon sale. This strategy can help optimize after-tax returns and simplify the tax implications associated with REIT investments. While holding REITs in taxable brokerage accounts is not necessarily a bad idea, the complexities of REIT taxation make IRAs a more attractive option.

In conclusion, understanding the nuances of REIT taxation is essential for investors seeking to maximize their returns from these investments. By recognizing the differences between REIT taxation and traditional stock taxation, investors can make informed decisions about their investment strategies and optimize their after-tax returns.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Investopedia:

REIT Taxation: Understanding the Unique Implications for Investors

As investors navigate the complex landscape of dividend investing, it's essential to understand the distinct tax implications associated with Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Unlike traditional stocks, REITs offer a unique set of benefits and drawbacks when it comes to taxation. In this article, we'll delve into the intricacies of REIT taxation and provide guidance on how investors can optimize their tax strategy.

One of the primary advantages of REITs is their ability to avoid corporate taxation. By distributing at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders, REITs can bypass the corporate tax burden, passing the savings on to investors. However, this benefit comes with a caveat: REIT dividends are subject to a unique tax treatment that can impact investors' tax liabilities.

REIT dividends can be classified into three main categories: ordinary income, long-term capital gains, and return of capital. Each type of distribution is taxed differently, and understanding these distinctions is crucial for investors seeking to minimize their tax burden. Ordinary income dividends, which account for the bulk of REIT distributions, are taxed at the investor's marginal tax rate. Long-term capital gains, on the other hand, are subject to lower tax rates, while return of capital distributions are not taxable in the short term, but can reduce the investor's cost basis in the REIT.

To illustrate the complexity of REIT taxation, consider a scenario where an investor owns shares of a REIT and receives a distribution of $244. Of this amount, $148.28 is taxable as ordinary income, $83.71 is eligible for the favorable long-term capital gains tax rate, and $12.01 is considered a return of capital, reducing the investor's cost basis in the REIT.

Investors can take advantage of the pass-through tax deduction, also known as the Section 199A Qualified Business Income deduction, which allows taxpayers to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income from their taxable income. However, this deduction is only applicable to the ordinary income portion of the REIT dividend.

Given the complexities of REIT taxation, it's essential for investors to consider the tax implications of holding REITs in taxable brokerage accounts versus tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as IRAs. By holding REITs in IRAs, investors can defer or avoid taxes on the individual level, while the REIT avoids corporate taxation.

In conclusion, REITs offer a unique set of benefits and challenges when it comes to taxation. By understanding the distinct tax implications associated with REITs, investors can optimize their tax strategy and make informed decisions about their investment portfolios.

0.357142857142857,"Refinancing student loans can be a good option for those with private education debt. By securing a refinance loan, borrowers can sometimes reduce their rate and total borrowing costs, and may be able to get other, more favorable new loan terms as well.
Unfortunately, to qualify for a student loan refinance, most private lenders require good credit and solid proof of income. And some younger borrowers who have just earned their degree may not have that. Lenders do allow cosigners, though, which could have some parents wondering if they should cosign for their kids.
Before you put your name on a student loan refinance application, you must think through the pros and cons to determine if it's the best course of action.
The biggest reason why a parent might want to cosign for a student loan refinance loan is to help out their child.
Education debt can be a huge financial burden, but refinancing private loans often helps ease that burden by making the debt cheaper and easier to pay if the new refinance loan has a better rate. Since refinance lenders consider credit and income, many young people wouldn't have the opportunity to qualify and lower their student loan costs without their parent's help.
It can be difficult to leave your child without this type of financial support, especially if your credit score and income are good, you're a well-qualified borrower, and your son or daughter is asking you for this assistance as they get their financial life started.
There are, however, some reasons not to cosign. Your own finances could be adversely affected in major ways.
If your child does not pay their loans on time and in full, your credit could be damaged due to a record of late payments and a default. You could be held responsible for paying the entire unpaid loan balance if your child stops paying -- and that could be tens of thousands of dollars you may not be able to afford.
Another issue is that when this debt shows up on your credit history, it affects your ability to borrow. Lenders treat it as your debt, and your debt-to-income ratio will be higher because of it. If you need to buy a house with a mortgage, borrow for a car, or take out loans to put other kids through college, you could run into trouble if you have a large student loan refinance loan on your record because you cosigned for it.
The good news is, you may not be stuck with the cosigned debt on your credit history forever. Many lenders allow cosigner release after the primary borrower makes a certain number of on-time payments. Sometimes, this is as little as 12 payments. But not every lender offers this option, so if you don't want the loans to be on your credit history for many years, you'd want to prioritize finding a lender that does.
Ultimately, you'll need to decide if you can and will help your child by cosigning a refinance loan. But don't take the decision lightly, as both your financial future and your child's financial future could be affected by your choice.

Getting a student loan without access to your parents’ financial information or credit history may be difficult, but it’s not impossible.
If you’re an independent student then you can borrow federal direct loans. If you have good credit, you can also choose from multiple private lenders. However, if you’re still technically dependent on your parents or you don’t have credit history, your choices are more limited.
No matter your situation, start by filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA, and applying for federal student loans. They’re preferred over private loans due to their low interest rates, varied repayment options and loan forgiveness opportunities.
Here’s how you can get a student loan without your parents.
You don’t need any parent information to apply for federal student loans if you’re an independent student. You’ll also have higher federal loan limits. You can borrow up to $57,000 in total federal student loans as an independent student, rather than $31,000 as a dependent student.
The answers you provide on the FAFSA determine your dependency status. If you answer “Yes” to at least one of the dependency questions on the application, you are considered independent. Use this checklist to prepare documents you'll need to apply as an independent student.
However, you won’t be considered independent just because your parents won’t help with the process. If you answer “No” to all of the dependency questions on the FAFSA, then you’re considered a dependent student, whether your parents will provide their information or not.
Get a dependency override. If you provide documentation to the U.S. Department of Education to prove you should be considered an independent student, you could get a dependency override. Approvals are made on a case-by-case basis and will apply only to students with unusual circumstances, such as an abusive family environment or parental abandonment.
Apply for aid without your parents. If you don’t qualify for a dependency override but your parents are unwilling to share their information, choose the following option on the FAFSA: “I am unable to provide information about my parent(s).” You then must select the option that indicates you don’t have a special circumstance but can’t provide parent information.
Without your parents’ information, you won’t get an Expected Family Contribution, which usually determines your aid. You will be able to take out an unsubsidized federal loan only, if any loan at all. Your college’s financial aid office will decide whether to lend to you. Contact your school to discuss taking out an unsubsidized loan.
If you need a private student loan to fill a college payment gap, but your parents are unable to co-sign, consider asking a relative or close friend to do so.
Choose a co-signer who can qualify. That means they need a credit score in the upper 600s or higher and a steady income. Make sure your co-signer understands he or she will be required to pay your student loan debt if you can’t.
Private student loans, even with a co-signer, are more expensive than federal student loans because they carry higher interest rates.
If you have no co-signer and no credit, but still need a private student loan, look into student loans without a co-signer. Typically, these lenders will consider your future income potential instead of your credit history when deciding whether to approve your application.
Private loans for independent students will carry higher interest rates than both federal loans and private loans with a co-signer. Compare offers from multiple lenders to get the best rate.

Refinancing Student Loans: Weighing the Pros and Cons of Cosigning

When it comes to refinancing student loans, borrowers with private education debt may be able to reduce their interest rates and total borrowing costs, securing more favorable loan terms in the process. However, qualifying for a student loan refinance often requires good credit and solid proof of income, which can be a challenge for younger borrowers who have just earned their degree.

This is where cosigners come into play. Lenders do allow cosigners, which can be a game-changer for borrowers who struggle to qualify on their own. But before you put your name on a student loan refinance application, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons carefully.

The biggest reason parents might consider cosigning for a student loan refinance is to help their child gain financial independence. Education debt can be a significant burden, but refinancing private loans can help alleviate that burden by making the debt cheaper and easier to pay. Many young people wouldn't have the opportunity to qualify and lower their student loan costs without their parent's help.

However, there are reasons to exercise caution. As a cosigner, your own finances could be significantly impacted. If your child fails to make timely payments or defaults on the loan, your credit score could take a hit. You could be held responsible for paying the entire unpaid loan balance, which could be tens of thousands of dollars.

Another issue to consider is that when this debt shows up on your credit history, it can affect your ability to borrow. Lenders treat it as your debt, and your debt-to-income ratio will be higher because of it. This can make it challenging to secure loans for other significant expenses, such as buying a house or financing a car.

The good news is that you may not be stuck with the cosigned debt on your credit history forever. Many lenders offer cosigner release after the primary borrower makes a certain number of on-time payments. Sometimes, this is as little as 12 payments. However, not every lender offers this option, so it's crucial to prioritize finding a lender that does.

Ultimately, you'll need to decide whether cosigning a refinance loan is right for you and your child. But don't take the decision lightly, as both your financial future and your child's financial future could be affected by your choice.

0.357142857142857,"Cryptocurrencies might be in a slump at the moment, but that hasn't stopped investors from jumping on the crypto bandwagon.
While most of the attention is focused on the biggest names in cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin (BTC 3.48%) and Ethereum (ETH 2.44%), countless newer coins have popped up over the past few months.
""Meme coins"" are often written off as a joke, but some investors believe they should be taken seriously. Cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (DOGE 1.99%) have made massive waves in the crypto space, and some people have made a lot of money from these investments. But are meme coins a smart investment?
The Dogecoin mascot -- and the inspiration for a spinoff. Image source: Getty Images.
Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that have gained popularity in a short amount of time, usually as a result of influencers and retail investors promoting them online.
Dogecoin is the original meme coin: It was created as a joke based on a meme back in 2013. It rose to fame after Elon Musk began tweeting about the cryptocurrency, and retail investors started buying in droves.
Because anybody can create a new cryptocurrency, developers have released a slew of meme coins after Dogecoin. Many of these coins are spinoffs of Dogecoin -- take the coin Shiba Inu (SHIB 2.37%), for example -- but there are thousands of other meme coins out there. In fact, according to the website CoinMarketCap, there are more than 5,000 meme coins in existence as of this writing.
Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency, but there's one major difference between cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu and currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it comes down to utility.
Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum were developed to solve real-world problems. The goal is to eventually become widely accepted by merchants, creating a new form of decentralized currency and revolutionizing a variety of industries.
Meme coins, on the other hand, serve no real-world purpose right now, and most of them were created as a way to make a quick buck.
Some of these coins have gained notoriety because they're promoted by influential celebrities, and retail investors have pumped up their prices by promoting them heavily online. This is why these coins tend to experience explosive growth despite their shaky fundamentals.
Once their prices surge, many investors sell shortly after to make a quick profit. Because meme coins have no real utility at the moment, it's unlikely they'll still be around in a few years or decades. Once investors move on to a new stock or cryptocurrency, meme coins will likely see their prices plummet.
While it is possible to make money investing in meme coins, this type of investment is incredibly risky and more similar to gambling than true investing. If you happen to buy and sell at precisely the right time, you could make a profit. It's more likely, though, that you'll lose all or most of the money you invest.
A better strategy is to focus on investments that are likely to perform well over the long run. Cryptocurrency in general is still highly speculative, so nobody knows how it will perform over time. But if you do invest in crypto, make sure you're choosing currencies that have strong fundamentals and are more likely to stand the test of time.

Meme coins (sometimes spelled ""memecoins"") are cryptocurrency tokens that are based on internet memes. Broadly defined, a meme is usually a popular phrase, image or idea that is shared on the internet. The first cryptocurrency in this category was Dogecoin (DOGE), which gained a large following after its release in 2013. Dogecoin is among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies available today with a market cap of slightly over $8 billion.
Dogecoin’s success inspired many developers to create their cryptocurrencies tied to a popular meme. Since 2013, hundreds of different meme coins have been released to the public, but few of them achieved similar popularity. Shiba Inu is the only other meme coin with a market cap of over a billion dollars and is currently ranked as the 12th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, which is a little over $6 billion.
when you open and fund an account with Webull.
Price: Meme coins trade at prices well under a dollar, and sometimes even a fraction of a cent. Their low price point creates a low barrier of entry for investors.
Volatility: Meme coin prices are often driven by pop culture and have been known to explode or crash at a moment’s notice.
Supply limits: Many meme coins either don’t have caps on how many cryptocurrency tokens can be minted, or have high caps. This makes them highly susceptible to inflation risk and increases their volatile price movements.
Accessibility: The most popular meme coins can generally be purchased at cryptocurrency exchanges.
Software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer created Dogecoin, which was released in 2013. Dogecoin was originally created as a joke, aiming to poke fun at Bitcoin enthusiasts. The creators of Dogecoin used a popular meme of a dog (purposely misspelled “Doge”) as the logo for their cryptocurrency.
The meme coin quickly gained a large following through social media. Just two weeks after its release, China banned third-party payment companies from transacting with Bitcoin exchanges. The news sent Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies into a tailspin, but the price of Dogecoin jumped up 300%. Meme coin prices are largely driven by popular culture and social media, and Dogecoin’s price surge demonstrated that their price movements have a low correlation to price changes in the larger cryptocurrency market. The following month, Dogecoin’s trading volume was higher than all other cryptocurrencies combined, according to crypto platform Gemini.
Dogecoin runs on its own blockchain network and uses a proof-of-work consensus algorithm that allows cryptocurrency miners to validate transactions. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin does not have a cap on how many cryptocurrency tokens can be minted, and there are currently millions of new Dogecoins being minted every day. Because of this, its prices are highly prone to inflation risk, and extremely volatile.
Since the price of each coin is typically well under a dollar, cryptocurrency investors tend to avoid using Dogecoin in their portfolio as a long-term investment. Instead, Dogecoin owners will regularly use it to reward online content creators through micro-tipping.
Meme coin prices are often driven by pop culture, and the Dogecoin community has made headlines on several occasions for its charity initiatives. On the Dogecoin website, it claims that its unofficial tagline is Do Only Good Everyday (an acronym for DOGE). In 2014, the online community raised $25,000 to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics. The same year, community members raised $30,000 and used it to provide access to clean drinking water in Kenya through a program called Doge4Water.
More recently in 2021, Dogecoin saw another price surge as celebrities, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and rapper Snoop Dogg, began to encourage investors to buy Dogecoin. The meme coin's price jumped more than 4,000% in 2021. On May 7 of that year, the price of Dogecoin went as high as 74 cents before tumbling back down to its current price of about 6 cents.
» More alternatives to Bitcoin: What are altcoins?
Shiba Inu (SHIB), a crypto token inspired by Dogecoin, is the second largest meme coin by market cap. Shiba Inu was created by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, and released in August 2020. Using the same breed of dog (the Shiba Inu) as its logo, Shiba Inu’s developers aimed to create a meme coin that would be an alternative to DOGE. Unlike DOGE, Shiba Inu was created on the Ethereum blockchain network.
Shiba Inu is unique in that it aims to be completely decentralized. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, SHIB has no funding, no centralized team and no governing body; it’s completely run by community members. It runs on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which does not support mining. Instead, transactions are validated through a process called staking.
Unlike many meme coins, Shiba Inu does place a limit on how many cryptocurrency tokens can be minted — but that limit is high. Shiba Inu has a circulating supply of 497 trillion tokens, with a total supply of one quadrillion. The extremely high number of SHIB coins in circulation keeps its price point low, and high transaction volume makes its value extremely volatile.
All cryptocurrencies are still considered to be alternative investments due to their newness and volatility. And of all the cryptocurrencies available, meme coins are typically the most volatile due to their supply and trading volume. Traditional financial wisdom would argue that alternative investments should account for the smallest percentage of your portfolio. In other words, don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.
The low price point for meme coins might seem attractive to potential investors, but proceed with caution. If you’re intent on purchasing a meme coin, it’s best to start small as their prices are highly unpredictable.

Meme Coins: A Risky Investment or a Smart Bet?

Cryptocurrencies have been on a rollercoaster ride lately, but investors are still eager to jump on the bandwagon. While most attention is focused on heavyweight cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, newer coins have been gaining popularity. ""Meme coins"" might be dismissed as a joke, but some investors believe they're worth taking seriously.

Meme coins, like Dogecoin, have made a significant impact on the crypto space, with some investors making a pretty penny from these investments. But are meme coins a smart investment? To understand this, we need to delve into the world of cryptocurrencies.

Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that gain popularity quickly, often due to online influencers and retail investors promoting them on social media. Dogecoin, the original meme coin, was created as a joke in 2013 but gained fame after Elon Musk tweeted about it. Since then, numerous meme coins have been created, with over 5,000 of them existing as of this writing.

The key difference between meme coins and major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum lies in their utility. Bitcoin and Ethereum were developed to solve real-world problems, aiming to become widely accepted forms of decentralized currency and revolutionize industries.

Meme coins, on the other hand, serve no real-world purpose and were mostly created to make a quick buck. Their popularity is often driven by celebrity endorsements and heavy online promotion, leading to explosive growth despite their shaky fundamentals. Once investors move on to the next hot stock or cryptocurrency, meme coins are likely to see their prices plummet.

While it's possible to make money investing in meme coins, it's an incredibly risky venture, more akin to gambling than investing. If you time your buy and sell correctly, you might profit, but it's more likely you'll lose most of your money.

A better strategy is to focus on investments with strong fundamentals, which are more likely to stand the test of time. Cryptocurrencies are still highly speculative, but choosing currencies with a clear purpose and potential for long-term growth can increase your chances of success.

As our Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team recently identified, there are better investment opportunities out there. If you're looking to invest in the crypto space, make sure you're choosing currencies with a clear purpose and potential for long-term growth.

**Meme Coins: A Smart Investment or a Risky Gamble?**

Cryptocurrencies have been making headlines lately, and while Bitcoin and Ethereum tend to dominate the conversation, newer coins have been popping up left and right. ""Meme coins"" - cryptocurrencies that gain popularity quickly, often thanks to online influencers and retail investors - have made a significant impact on the crypto space. But are they a smart investment?

**What Are Meme Coins?**

Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that have gained rapid popularity, usually as a result of online promotions and hype. Dogecoin, created as a joke in 2013, is the original meme coin. It skyrocketed in value after Elon Musk began tweeting about it, and retail investors jumped on the bandwagon. Since then, developers have released thousands of similar coins, including spinoffs like Shiba Inu.

**The Key Difference**

While Bitcoin and Ethereum were created to solve real-world problems and have a clear utility, meme coins serve no practical purpose. They're often created to make a quick profit, and their value is largely driven by speculation and hype. This means that, unlike more established cryptocurrencies, meme coins are unlikely to be around in the long term.

**The Risks**

Investing in meme coins can be incredibly risky. Because they have no underlying value, their prices are prone to sudden and drastic changes. If you buy in at the wrong time, you could lose a significant amount of money. Furthermore, the lack of regulation in the crypto space means that investors have little protection against fraud or scams.

**A Better Strategy**

Instead of chasing the latest meme coin, consider investing in cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and a clear utility. These investments may take longer to pay off, but they're more likely to stand the test of time. If you do decide to invest in crypto, make sure you're choosing currencies with a proven track record and a clear purpose.

**Takeaway**

Meme coins may be fun to invest in, but they're not a smart long-term investment strategy. If you're looking to make money in the crypto space, focus on currencies with real utility and a proven track record. And always remember to do your research and invest wisely.

0.34375,"Credit card companies ask for your income when you fill out an application, but how much is enough to get approved? If you're a college student who earns $100 per week from a part-time job, can you get a credit card? What about if your only source of income is a Social Security benefit?
The short answer is that the minimum income for a credit card depends on the particular card and your personal credit history, but you'll need some income to get approved. There is no set-in-stone minimum, but here's what you need to know about income and credit card approval before you get started.
Broadly speaking, there is no minimum income requirement to get approved for a credit card, as long as your income could easily cover the minimum payments on a relatively small credit line. However, your income will help the credit card issuer set your limit, which can not only impact your spending power but can have credit scoring implications as you use your credit card.
With some forms of debt (like mortgages), there are pretty clear income guidelines. But with credit cards, it's a little less clear. Credit card issuers are legally required to ask applicants for their income, and to use that stated income to verify the borrower can afford their monthly payments. But there aren't any set-in-stone guidelines.
Credit card issuers use different methods of determining their minimum monthly payments, and borrowers can have significantly different interest rates. So a $1,000 credit line can have very different monthly payment requirements on two different cards.
Credit card issuers won't thoroughly investigate your income like a mortgage or auto lender would. For example, it's rare for a credit card company to ask to see your W-2s. As long as you have some income, the biggest factor in the approval process is your credit score and other credit accounts.
You can use earned income from employment, self-employment, or independent contractor roles to qualify for a credit card. But here's some good news, especially if your income isn't from traditional sources (like a job).
If you're under 21, but at least 18, the rules are a little different. Income you include must be yours, so allowances, gifts, and third-party income cannot be considered. You'll essentially need personal income from a job, or scholarships and grants that justify the credit line.
Learn more: Should You Update Your Income With a Credit Card Issuer?
The short answer is ""sort of,"" but it's become much more difficult in recent years to get a credit card with no income. Prior to the passage of the CARD Act in 2009, it was much easier for credit card companies to give cards to people with no income. This was especially true for college students -- most people who attended college before the CARD Act went into effect will remember the credit card companies soliciting students to apply outside of the student center. Not anymore.
If you're a student looking for a credit card that's a good match for your lifestyle, take a look at a few we recommend below to see if one might be a good choice. You can also check out our full list of the Best Student Credit Cards for more.
A secured credit card is one that requires a refundable security deposit to open. It can be a good way to start building or rebuilding credit. But there's a popular misconception that you can get a secured credit card with no income since you're required to put down a deposit to open the account.
A deposit does make it easier to overcome a lower credit score on a credit card application. But secured credit card issuers generally want to see that a borrower has income. Aside from the deposit, a secured card isn't treated much differently (legally speaking) than a standard credit card.
If you're looking for a secured credit card to help build your credit, take a look at a few of our favorites below. Our list of the Best Secured Credit Cards has more options you might like too.
Discover will match all the cash back you’ve earned at the end of your first year.
Yes. You can get a credit card with relatively low amounts of income, but the credit limit you get will be related to that amount (Higher incomes tend to get higher limits, but not always).
Technically there is no minimum income, although credit card companies are legally required to ensure the applicant's income will be sufficient to support the card's monthly payments. They will also look at other factors like your credit score.
No. It may sound tempting to lie about your income to improve your chances of approval, or to get a higher credit limit, but this is a bad idea. In practice, credit card companies rarely verify an applicant's income (it's most common with applicants under 21). However, lying on a credit application is fraud and can result in serious fines and/or jail time if you're caught.

When you have damaged credit, those “easy-to-get” credit cards aren’t always easy to get.
Even with credit cards for bad credit, issuers vet applicants carefully against several requirements, known as underwriting standards, to find customers who are less likely to default. In some cases, federal law also requires issuers to get certain information before extending credit to a borrower.
If you want to qualify for a secured credit card — that is, a card that requires a cash deposit — or an unsecured card for bad credit, here's what you'll need.
Required for all U.S. credit cards.
No matter where you apply for a credit card, your issuer will always want to know who you are. Provisions of the USA Patriot Act designed to combat terrorism and money-laundering require issuers to get your personal information.
For most people, providing name, address and birthdate is the easy part. But if you're new to the U.S., filling out the Social Security number field might be a stumbling block. If you don’t have an SSN, you can get an individual taxpayer identification number. If you skip these sections altogether, or if you’re under 18, your application will be rejected.
Required for all U.S. credit cards.
Issuers must check that borrowers have an “ability to pay” before extending them credit, under the Credit Card Act of 2009. But depending on the issuer, that can mean different things.
At the very least, your issuer is going to ask about your annual income, to make sure you have one. If you're over 21, this includes all the income to which you have ""reasonable expectation of access.” That means you can include your partner’s income.
Most secured cards don't have minimum income requirements. But some take your debt and monthly living expenses into consideration. The Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card, for example, will deny your application if your monthly income doesn’t exceed your rent or mortgage payment by at least $425, according to its terms.
If you're applying for an unsecured credit card from a major issuer, you'll likely have to meet a minimum income requirement — usually $10,000 or $12,000 per year. If your income is too low, or you're carrying too much debt, your application might be rejected.
Required for all secured cards.
Unlike “regular” credit cards, secured cards usually require cash collateral when you open a new account. Typically, you need to put down at least $200 or $300 for a security deposit, which then determines your credit limit. For example, a $300 deposit would get you a $300 limit. If you fall behind on payments, the issuer keeps that deposit. Otherwise, you’ll get your money back when you close the account in good standing or upgrade to an unsecured credit card.
If you’re having trouble coming up with that kind of money, it's usually best to save up for a secured card with a lower deposit requirement. Also, explore credit cards for poor credit that don't require a security deposit. Unsecured credit cards from subprime specialist issuers — or issuers that focus on borrowers with bad credit — may seem appealing, but could end up costing you over $100 more in fees each year, according to a NerdWallet study.
A checking or savings account gives you a secure place to store money and can help you build an emergency fund. But often it's also required for funding a secured card's security deposit or used by issuers to determine your financial stability. If your ChexSystems record is keeping you from opening an account, look for a bank or credit union that offers a second-chance checking account in your area.
Some credit cards, like the OpenSky® Secured Visa® Credit Card, don't run credit checks. But most do. Usually, issuers do this to look for red flags that your financial life might be getting worse, not better. For instance, for the Discover it® Secured Credit Card, “Factors such as income, bankruptcy, debt and judgments"" — for example, liens or lawsuits — ""may impact your ability to be approved,” according to a statement from Discover. Among major issuers, these types of warnings are typical.
Try to improve your credit as much as you can before applying for cards — say, by getting caught up on payments on your existing accounts. If a recent bankruptcy is keeping you from an approval, find out whether you can get a credit card with your local bank or credit union. While cards that skip credit checks are an option, they tend to be more expensive.
Bad blood can sometimes get in the way of a credit card approval. If you’ve defaulted on your payments with a certain issuer before, that issuer likely won't approve your application for a new card. Instead of dwelling on the past, start a clean slate by working with a different company. Remember, many banks are happy to get your business. Look for a lender that gives you a chance to rebuild your credit on good terms.
Whether you want to pay less interest or earn more rewards, the right card's out there. Just answer a few questions and we'll narrow the search for you.

0.342105263157895,"I recently wrote about Warren Buffett's advice on how investors should respond to a super-contagious disease. You might think the super-contagious disease the billionaire business legend referred to was the coronavirus disease COVID-19. Instead, Buffett's advice, written to Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.17%) (BRK.B 1.00%) shareholders back in 1987, related to two other epidemics that he said occur from time to time in the stock market -- fear and greed.
Buffett's observation about these two ""super-contagious disease"" spurred one of his most famous statements of all time: ""We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful."" This quote from the Oracle of Omaha is repeated often, or at least part of it is. But saying something is a lot easier than doing it.
With the stock market crashing, fear is definitely running rampant. Here are three steps you can take to be greedy while nearly everyone else is being fearful.
Perhaps the most important thing you can do right now is to see things are they really are. Sure, the market is tanking. But it's really an opportunity for investors who have some cash to deploy.
Keep in mind what Buffett said during the darkest days of the financial crisis that began in 2008 and extended into 2009, ""It's been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend."" In retrospect, his words turned out to be 100% correct. Investors who bought in late 2008 and early 2009 and held on for a few years made fortunes.
You might be tempted to hoard any cash you have with all of the uncertainty related to the coronavirus outbreak. That's a fearful stance, though. Buffett has noted in the past that ""the best chance to deploy capital is when things are going down.""
A good case in point is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.71%). The biotech stock has fallen nearly 9% off its highs. Unsurprisingly, Vertex hasn't seen any effects from coronavirus disease COVID-19 on any part of its business. Its supply chain is robust and hasn't been disrupted in any way. Vertex is a better bargain now than it was just a week ago -- and its growth prospects haven't changed a bit. That's a buying opportunity.
Once you see the current stock market climate as an opportunity, start looking for quality stocks. As Buffett once said, ""Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down.""
It might be tempting to buy shares of only the most beaten-down stocks. Don't. Remember the following advice from the legendary investor: ""The stock market is a no-called-strike game. You don't have to swing at everything -- you can wait for your pitch.""
What are the kinds of pitches to swing at right now? Again, my recommendation is to follow Buffett's approach to ""buy companies with strong histories of profitability and with a dominant business franchise.""
One of the top stocks that comes to my mind is Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.43%). The robotic surgical systems maker is highly profitable and has been for a long time. Its revenue and earnings continue to grow by strong double-digit percentages. Intuitive is the clear leader in the robotic surgical systems market.
Shares of Intuitive Surgical have fallen more than 17% below their highs from early February. Perhaps a few patients might delay elective surgeries because of concerns about getting COVID-19, but the long-term aging trends continue to be a huge tailwind for Intuitive Surgical. It's a quality stock that has taken an unwarranted drubbing.
No matter what you do, think long term. Buffett was exactly right when he said, ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes.""
In October 2008, Buffett wrote an editorial in The New York Times. If you've forgotten, that was the month the stock market began a steep decline that eventually led to the S&P 500 index falling by 20%. In his editorial, Buffett wrote, ""In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.""
He echoed that sentiment in his 2017 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, stating, ""For 240 years it's been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start."" Buffett's view was right in 2008. It was right in 2017. And it's still right in 2020.
By the way, thinking long term can even mean looking at stocks that have benefited from the COVID-19 scare in a different way. Gilead Sciences (GILD -4.25%), for example, has moved higher thanks to its antiviral drug remdesivir, which has shown promise in treating COVID-19. But an even more important reason to buy Gilead stock is the opportunities for the company's pipeline candidates, especially immunology drug filgotinib and long-acting HIV drug GS-6207.
Buffett has dished out so much incredible advice through the years that I've only touched the surface with the quotes I've mentioned. I'll leave you with one more profound piece of wisdom from the legendary investor: ""It is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results.""
Being greedy when others are fearful doesn't take an extraordinary effort. All you have to do is follow the three steps outlined above to achieve extraordinary results over the long run.

When others are greedy, prices typically boil over and one should be cautious lest they overpay for an asset that subsequently leads to anemic returns. It might present a good value investment opportunity when others are fearful.
The return that arises as a stock gravitates back to its intrinsic value over time will erode if you pay too high a price. Act greedy when others are fearful and reap enhanced returns under the right set of circumstances. Predictability must be present and short-term events that create the subsequent downgrade in prices must not erode intrinsic value. Here’s how Buffett did it.
He doesn't purchase stocks just because they're on sale. That approach was his mentor Ben Graham’s style. Known as the “cigar butt” style of investing, this approach picks up discarded business cigar butts from the side of the road, selling them at deep discounts to book value with one good puff left in them.
Graham looked for “net-nets."" These are businesses that are priced below their net current assets or current assets minus total liabilities.
Warren Buffett began his investing career this way but he evolved in the face of anemic net-net opportunities. With the help of Charlie Munger, he discovered the land of outstanding businesses, the home of See’s Candy and Coca-Cola (KO). These were businesses with durable, competitive economics (the protective moat) and rational, honest management.
The fear-inducing events that lead to superior investment opportunities can include short-term shock waves created by macroeconomic events such as recessions, wars, sector apathy, or short-term, non–moat damaging business results.
It's estimated that this event cost American Express an excess of $100 million in losses, according to some sources.
The salad oil scandal and GEICO’s business model drift are prime examples of the kind of shockwaves that can create value and that have allowed Warren Buffett to reap substantial returns over the years. To be greedy when others are fearful is a valuable mindset that can reap substantial rewards for the investor.
But Buffett's comment about fear is far from the only or most quoted bit of investment advice that he's shared over the years. He's dropped some interesting comments on everything from investing pointers to lifestyle guidance and simply managing your money.
He advises against draining your financial well by helping family members to the point where you have nothing left to continue to invest in the security of your retirement. Your offspring might not appreciate the sentiment but at least they shouldn't have to support you in your old age.
This idea comes from understanding market psychology. Investors are often driven by emotions such as fear and greed, especially in aggregate. Breed can keep people buying and bidding up prices, hoping for ever-larger returns or profits, when markets are rising. This can in turn lead to asset bubbles that will eventually pop.
Buffett is known as the “Oracle of Omaha” because investors and other financial professionals closely follow his investment picks and comments on the market, even though he famously resides in Omaha, Neb. rather than New York City and doesn't work on Wall Street.
Warren Buffett is no longer a young man, although he still runs his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway. He was born in 1930.
It's time to leave the party when the shoeshine boy starts giving out investing tips. Charlie Munger once likened a frothy stock market to a New Year’s Eve party that's gone on long enough. The bubbly is flowing, everyone is enjoying themselves, and the clocks have no arms on them. No one has a clue that it's time to leave, nor do they want to. How about just one more drink?
It's imperative as a business-value investor to know when it's time to leave and to be prepared for that perfect opportunity. Be greedy when others are fearful but be greedy for investment with long-term durable economics and rational, honest management.

0.33974358974359,"Cashier's checks and money orders are considered to be safer forms of payment compared to personal checks, but they differ in terms of where you can buy them, what they cost, and when it makes sense to use one over the other. You can use a money order or cashier’s check instead if you have to pay someone and you don’t want to use cash or write a personal check.
Cashier’s checks aren’t entirely foolproof, however, and fraudulent cashier’s checks can feature in financial scams. A scammer might present you with what looks like an official cashier’s check, which you then deposit into your account.3 Your bank may discover weeks later that the check is fake.
A cashier’s check is an official check that’s issued by a bank. It’s not the same as a certified check, which is drawn on a depositor's checking account after the bank has certified and put a hold on sufficient funds to pay the check's amount.
A cashier’s check is a type of official check that’s issued by a bank. It’s not to be confused with a certified check, which is a check drawn on a depositor's checking account that the bank certifies there are sufficient funds to pay.
Replacing a lost or stolen money order is often as simple as returning with your receipt to the place where it was purchased and asking for a replacement or refund. The money order issuer may charge you a fee to replace it, but you can get it right away instead of waiting months for a cashier’s check to be reissued.
Money orders are generally easier to buy, but cashier’s checks are more secure. So which should you use and when?
Money orders are less expensive, making them more suitable for smaller payments or when writing a personal check isn't an option.7 You might want to use a money order to pay rent or to send a few hundred dollars to a friend who’s short on cash.
Contact the bank that's named on the check to make sure it’s authentic before you accept it for payment from an unknown party or try to cash or deposit it.
Money orders and cashier’s checks can be a convenient way to pay someone or to receive money. Remember to check the fees involved and whether the issuer puts any limits on dollar amounts if you’re planning to purchase either one. Most importantly, keep your receipt or statement showing when the money order or cashier’s check was purchased in case it's lost, stolen, or damaged.

Money orders and cashier’s checks can each be helpful if you need a more secure payment method than a personal check or cash — or if you don’t have a checking account. But they have some key distinctions.
The main difference between cashier’s checks and money orders is that cashier’s checks are better for larger purchases whereas money orders come in smaller amounts. Additionally, cashier’s checks tend to cost more while money orders are cheaper and easier to buy.
Use a cashier's check if ...
Use a money order if ...
Here's how to decide which works best for you.
Cashier’s checks are better for large purchases. Say you want to spend $5,000 on a used car, but the seller won’t accept a personal check. If you’re not keen on carrying large amounts of cash, you need another form of guaranteed payment.
In this case, a cashier’s check, sometimes called an official check, would be the better choice. Many businesses won't issue a money order for more than $1,000, but there's typically no limit on the amount a cashier's check can cover.
On the other hand, if you need to make a $500 deposit for an apartment and can’t use a personal check, a money order would be wiser because they're generally less expensive.

Money orders usually cost less. Walmart has some of the best prices for money orders, charging a maximum of 88 cents for amounts up to $1,000 with valid government-issued photo ID. The U.S. Postal Service charges from $1.25 to $1.76, depending on the amount. Banks often charge around $5.
Cashier’s checks in any amount will set you back around $10.
Some banks and credit unions waive fees on cashier’s checks and money orders for customers with certain accounts.
Money orders are easier to buy. You can buy money orders at post offices, some retail stores, banks, money transfer outlets and elsewhere. Going to a supermarket for milk? You could also pick up a money order at the customer-service counter.
Cashier’s checks, on the other hand, are usually available only from a financial institution where you're a member.
If you’re hoping to buy either one online, you won’t have much luck. Issuers often require that you visit a physical location to buy a money order or cashier’s check. If that’s not an option, you could ask your recipient to let you send money online instead. This is typically free with a bank account, and among peer-to-peer transfer services, Venmo doesn’t charge users for paying with a prepaid debit card.
Cashier’s checks can be a little safer. If you lose a cashier’s check or money order, or if it’s stolen, you can take steps to recover your money — generally by showing the issuer your receipt and asking for a refund. That makes either option safer than carrying cash.
However, on a money order, the purchaser fills in the receiver's name, which is similar to writing a check. (Learn more about how to write a check here.) If you lose the money order before filling it in, anyone could cash it. And once someone cashes that money order, you more than likely won’t get your money back.
If a money order or cashier’s check is cashed fraudulently, you could contact police and work through the legal system to try to recover the money.
Cashier’s checks offer a bit more protection, because the financial institution fills out the “pay to” line instead of the purchaser. And an official check drawn up by a financial institution may seem more credible to a recipient than a money order from your local 24-hour market. But either option is a good way to guarantee payment.

0.3375,"If you have outstanding debts and find yourself with disposable income, you might be conflicted about whether to save that amount or allocate it towards paying off your debt. Giving careful consideration to the pros and cons of both options can help you to make a practical decision.
Saving allows you to generate a nest egg while paying off your debt helps you save money on the interest you pay. In this article, we lay out some of the key considerations for doing both that you can include in your decision-making process.
One of the main things to consider as you mull over whether to pay off your debts or save is to understand your financial situation. You won't be able to get a good grasp of what to do until you're firm in where you stand at the moment.
Once you determine these, make a list of all the debts you have. Be sure to include creditor names, balances, interest rates, payment due dates, and whether you're making the minimum monthly payment or going above by making a larger lump-sum payment each month.
There are a few things you'll have to prioritize, including the potential earnings generated from putting your money into a savings account versus the cost of holding your debt, and whether you have an emergency fund in case things get tough.
When you save your money, you commit to putting aside any additional money you have at the end of the month with the hope that it will generate a return. You may consider putting your money into a savings account, certificate of deposit (CD), government security like a Treasury bill (T-bill), or a money market account.
Saving your money requires a great deal of discipline and focus. It can be very disheartening when you consider the rate of return on many savings vehicles, which is typically lower than the interest on any debt you have. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the national average rate for a savings account was 0.46% while a 60-month CD was 1.39% as of Nov. 20, 2023.1 Keep in mind, though, that many of these vehicles rely on compounding, which means you earn interest on the money you deposit as well as the interest you earn.
As noted above, you'll have to ask yourself some important questions before you decide to save your money. How much money are you making each month? Can you make any sacrifices to set aside some money for savings? Can you even afford to save some money as you factor in your debt situation?Let's assume that you have an extra $250 at the end of each month after you factor in your monthly expenses. If you add this amount to a savings account (and make the minimum monthly payments on your debts), the interest you receive would be determined by the type of asset in which the amount is invested. Assuming a conservative rate of 2% compounded daily, your total savings after nine years would be about $29,580.
Be sure to ask yourself whether the money you may earn in a savings vehicle would be more than the cost of holding a debt.
Like saving, debt management and repayment can seem overwhelming. But it doesn't have to be, especially if you can put aside your emotions and focus on the end goal. You may even have to tighten up on that extra spending (like that daily coffee and donut) to eliminate your balance.
Assume you have a credit card balance of $6,500 with an annual percentage rate (APR) of 19.5%, and you make the minimum monthly payment of $130. It would take you 101 months to pay off the balance and will cost you over $6,600 of interest.
Let's assume again that you have disposable income of $250 each month. If you add this amount to your credit card payments, it would reduce your payoff period to about 20 months and cost you about $1,000 in interest. This results in a saving of about $5,600.
If you're the type of person who pays off your credit card balance(s) each month, you may want to consider putting more of your disposable income into a savings vehicle.
The short answer is yes. But again, it depends on your financial situation and your resolve. For instance, if you have a lot of debt and you're scraping by with just the minimum payments, it may be a good idea to focus only on your debts and put the thought of saving aside until you get a better grasp of your liabilities. If you're focused, have the discipline, and aren't overburdened with debt, you may be able to do both.
Here are a few options that you have available that allow you to save while you pay off your debts.
An emergency or rainy day fund is generally used to cover unexpected expenses and can be invaluable in the event of a job loss or other emergency. This is something you should have even if you have balances owing. If you don't already have one set aside, it might be more beneficial to add your disposable income to such an account.
Keep in mind that paying off your debt, such as a credit card balance, and freeing up your credit limit is not a practical substitute for a rainy day fund. It is not the soundest financial strategy to rely on credit in an emergency. It should be a last resort. By using savings instead of credit, you avoid falling into debt and paying hefty interest charges. Furthermore, if you have been using credit cards in a manner deemed irresponsible by the issuer, your credit limit may be reduced after paying off debt. Thus, reducing your ability to turn to credit in a rainy day situation. And remember, a rainy day fund is for emergencies—not for that luxury good that you've had your eyes on for the last six months.
Saving with a 401(k) takes the guesswork out of saving because it relies on automatic payroll deductions so you don't have to do anything—your employer does it for you. This option is even better if your employer matches your contribution because it gives you free money that goes toward your retirement savings.
Some banks allow you to save automatically every time you spend. You'll have to open a savings account and use your debit card to take advantage of this feature. Whenever you use your debit card, your purchase will be rounded up to the next dollar with the extra change swept over to your sales account.
So if you buy something for $18.37, your bank will round it up to $19, with the additional 63 cents moved over to your savings account. This allows you to save smaller amounts while concentrating more money on your monthly bills.
Paying just the minimum balance on your credit card(s) and/or loan(s) means it will take longer to pay off the balance. That's because more of your payment goes toward interest rather than the principal balance.
If you make a little more than the minimum payment, you'll cut down the balance as well as the time it takes to eliminate the debt. Any extra money (even a few dollars) can go into your savings account.
Some credit cards offer you points on the purchases you make. These points translate to money. For instance, some card issuers offer you 1% cash back on all of your purchases. Others may give you a higher percentage on different categories, such as gas, groceries, and restaurants.
So if you have a rewards card, consider using this sum to get a statement credit that pays down your balance. If you're able to, you may also use it to deposit into a savings account.
If you have good credit, you may be able to get a debt consolidation loan. This allows you to pay off all your debts and make one larger monthly payment to one creditor rather than to multiple lenders.
Pooling your debts into a consolidation loan lets you make one monthly payment, which may give you some additional money at the end of the month so you can stash some money aside into a savings account. One thing to remember: Don't rack up those credit cards again once they're all paid off.
Yes, you can save money and pay off your debts at the same time. How much you put to both depends entirely on your financial situation (notably, how much disposable income you have) and end goals. If you intend to be debt-free sooner, you'll likely want to focus more of your disposable income on your financial obligations. If you carry fewer balances, consider putting a little extra toward saving. Keep in mind that you should consider the pros and cons of the cost of carrying debt versus the interest you'll earn from saving before making a decision.
If you have some extra money each month, you may want to consider one of the many options available to help you save.
The most basic is a savings account. Some financial institutions offer high-yield savings accounts, which yield higher than traditional accounts. Money market accounts offer higher yields while giving you some of the benefits of a checking account.
If you can afford depositing a large sum and don't need the money right away, consider a CD, which locks in your money for a specific period of time, usually at a higher rate than a savings account.
If you're saving for a rainy day, though, make sure you put your money into a highly liquid account (like a savings account) so you can easily access it when the need arises.
Consider your full financial picture when you decide whether you'll save or pay off your debts. This can include whether you have someone else you can rely on in the event you are unable to cover unplanned expenses. If you are unsure of which solution is most suitable for you, splitting your disposable income between the two options may allow you to benefit from both. Working with a financial planner may help to provide a comprehensive solution.

Paying off debt can feel like it has to be your only financial priority.
But you should do some saving while you’re paying down debt. Even a small cushion of emergency savings can keep you from going deeper into debt when an unexpected expense pops up. And you don’t want to miss out on free money from an employer match on retirement savings if it's available.
Even a small emergency fund can help keep your finances stable when a crisis hits. NerdWallet recommends building an emergency fund of at least $500 to start, then growing your reserves from there.
Use the 50/30/20 budget to help you allocate your funds so you can build up your savings. With this method, half your income goes to needs, like housing, groceries and transportation. Then 30% goes to wants, like entertainment and eating out, and the final 20% goes to debt payments and savings. Depending on your debt load and income, you may want to reduce your wants category and beef up your debt payments and savings.
If you’ve struggled to budget for savings in the past, try the “pay yourself first” method, where you set up a direct deposit to send a portion of your paycheck into a savings account rather than putting what you have left at the end of the month into savings.
Consider using a high-yield savings account for your emergency fund. These accounts are free to open and earn more interest than standard checking accounts.
Retirement might be the last thing on your mind when facing the urgency of paying off debt.
But if your employer offers a match in a tax-advantaged account such as a 401(k), contribute enough to meet the maximum match. That’s free money.
Doing this now is important because you can’t get this match retroactively. Plus, amassing what you need for retirement depends heavily on the effect of compound interest over a long time period; getting a late start will cut into your ability to afford retirement.
Once you get your basic savings established, focus on paying off your toxic debts, like payday loans, credit cards with interest rates higher than 15%, car title loans and rent-to-own payments.
You should focus on these first because their high interest rates can eat up your budget and create a spiral of debt.
A debt payoff calculator will let you see when you’ll get out of debt with your current payments and how much faster you could ditch debt if you pay more each month.
Tip: Check out debt snowball and debt avalanche payoff methods to see which is right for you.
You are struggling to meet your minimums and see no way to resolve your debt in five years.
Your total unsecured debt is greater than half your gross income.
Tools like a debt management plan from a nonprofit credit counseling agency or Chapter 7 bankruptcy can help you retire your debts faster.
With your toxic debt under control, you can turn to building up greater cash reserves and retirement savings while working to pay off the rest of your debt.
If you’re putting just enough into your 401(k) to get the match, you can add more. Work up to saving 15% of your gross income toward retirement.
Tip: If your workplace doesn’t offer a plan, you have other ways to save for retirement, such as an individual retirement account.
Student loans, credit cards with interest rates of 15% or lower, or auto loans may be easier forms of debt to manage, but it’s still important to make a plan to repay what you owe.
You may be able to speed things up with some go-to tips for paying off your debt faster, including trimming expenses from your budget, taking on a side gig to drum up extra cash and exploring debt consolidation.

Property taxes are levied by cities, counties, and school districts on the properties within their boundaries and they're used by these organizations to provide services. All these levies are added together to calculate property taxes and work out the total tax rate, known as a mill rate, for a region. This rate is then multiplied by the assessed value of a property so people with more valuable properties pay more. Millions of homeowners pay property taxes every year.
Different property types have various types of taxes assessed on the land and its structures. Vacant land will have a significantly lower assessed value than a comparable piece of property that's improved. It will have lower property taxes as a result. The land assessment might be higher if there is access to public services, such as sewer, water, and gas. It could lead to a higher assessment and more taxes for the owner if the assessor feels that the land has the potential to be developed.
The amount that a property is taxed comes from a percentage of the assessed value of the property.
Property taxes are a major source of income for city and county governments. Their boards, councils, and legislatures meet to decide the appropriate rates. They hold budget hearings to determine how much money must be allocated to provide the various services required by the local community. These services include education, transportation, emergency, parks, recreation, and libraries and are funded by property taxes.
Property taxes are calculated based on the value of the property. This includes both the land and the buildings on it. Tax assessors will typically value the property every one to five years and charge the owner of record the appropriate rate according to the standards set by the taxing authority. Assessors calculate that value using the mill levy, also called the millage tax, and the assessed property value.
The tax rate for a property is determined by how many city and school districts a property lies within and adding together the rates applied by each. This aggregate rate is referred to as the mill levy. Each entity calculates its required mill levy and they are then tallied together to calculate the total mill levy.
Every city, county, and school district generally has the power to levy taxes against the properties within its boundaries.
Suppose the total assessed property value in a county is $100 million and the county decides it needs $1 million in tax revenues to run its necessary operations. The mill levy would be $1 million divided by $100 million, which equals 1%. The total mill levy for the region would be 4.5% (1% + 0.5% + 3%) or 45 mills if the city and the school district calculated a mill levy of 0.5% and 3%, respectively.
Two further steps are required to calculate a tax bill. First, a property’s value must be assessed via one of three methods. Then the value is multiplied by the assessment rate, which varies by jurisdiction and represents the percentage of a property on which taxes are due.
Suppose the assessor determines that your property value is $500,000 and the assessment rate is 8%. The assessed value would be $40,000. Taking the mill levy of 4.5% that we calculated previously, the tax due would be $1,800 ($40,000 × 4.5%).
Property taxes are calculated by taking the mill levy and multiplying it by the assessed value of the owner’s property. The assessed value estimates the reasonable market value for your home. It's based upon prevailing local real estate market conditions. The assessor will review all relevant information surrounding your property to estimate its overall value.
To give you the most accurate assessment, the assessor must look at what comparable properties are selling for under the current market conditions, how much the replacement costs for the property would be, the maintenance costs for the property owner, any improvements that were completed, any income you're making from the property, and how much interest would be charged to purchase or construct a property comparable to yours.
The assessor can estimate the market value of the property by using three methods and they have the option of choosing a single one or any combination of the three.
After determining the market value of the property, the assessed value will be arrived at by taking its actual value and multiplying it by an assessment rate. That rate is a uniform percentage and varies by tax jurisdiction. It could be any percentage below 100%. The assessed value is multiplied by the mill levy to determine your property taxes due.
The assessor works in two stages when they have the value: First, they send the assessed value of the property to the owner then they follow it up with a tax bill.
Most property tax assessments are performed either annually or every five years depending on the community where the property is located. A property tax bill is mailed separately after the owner has received their assessment with its property valuation.
The information that the assessor has is considered to be part of the public record. Owners can see how much they must pay by going to the assessor’s website and entering their address. They may sometimes be charged a small fee for accessing this material.
Another option is to go to the assessor’s office in the county courthouse. You can look up the information there and print out a copy for a nominal fee.
This will typically be due to the assessed value of your home being higher. Your home may have a higher value if you have a larger plot of land, if your residence is larger, or if your home has desirable features. In some rare cases, however, you may live in a different jurisdiction from your neighbor.
Paying the right amount of property taxes requires understanding how the tax is calculated, where you can get this information, and when tax bills are sent out and due. Some cities allow their residents to view and/or pay their property tax bills online. Property owners should do their part to remain educated by knowing how their taxes are calculated, when the billing cycle is, and where they can locate this information.

Property tax is a levy on certain types of physical property, such as homes, real estate and land. Local governments typically assess property tax, and the property owner pays the tax. The amount of tax due depends on the property's location and how much it’s worth.
Local and state governments collect property taxes to fund school districts, police and fire departments, road construction and other local services. The local taxing authority, likely your county but possibly your city or town instead, typically determines the tax rate, which then gets multiplied by your home's value, to determine your tax bill.
The term property tax is often used interchangeably with ""real estate tax,"" but some states also assess property tax on personal items, such as cars, boats, aircraft, machinery and even livestock.

Assessors (sometimes called appraisers) who work for the local taxing authority track the value of every piece of land and real estate in a taxing district, such as a city or county. They maintain databases of local property values, often using sophisticated mapping software.
To determine your property tax rate, your home's value is typically multiplied by the established property tax rate. Your home’s assessed value will likely be less than its market value. By how much less will vary by location, but it's common. The county may have many ways to detect changes in your home’s value, including inspections, permit applications from a remodeling project, reports from neighbors or regular updates.
Some states or local governments send a property tax bill annually, while others charge semi-annually or quarterly. Alternatively, property taxes can also be included in your mortgage payment, if you have an escrow account with your mortgage servicer.
Property tax is typically determined by multiplying the value of the property by a tax rate: Property tax = value of the property x tax rate.
Your tax rate might not necessarily be expressed as a percentage, but rather as some number of mills, because real estate tax rates are also often based on the ""millage rate,"" where one mill is equal to one-thousandth of a dollar. For example, if the local property tax rate on homes is 15 mills, homeowners pay $15 in tax for every $1,000 in assessed home value. Accordingly, a house with a $200,000 assessed value would be taxed $3,000.
Some taxing authorities apply the tax rate only to a portion of the home value rather than to the full home value. That can reduce the bill.
» Use our mortgage calculator to see how these taxes can affect your monthly mortgage payment.
Write a check or pay online once a year, every six months or quarterly when the bill comes from the taxing authority.
If your mortgage includes an escrow account, your total mortgage payment likely factors in your property taxes. If your escrow account doesn’t have enough funds to cover all of your monthly costs, the mortgage servicer may need to pay using its own funds, which can lead to increased monthly mortgage premiums or an additional bill for you.
If you're trying to pay property tax online, find tax records, or wondering how much the tax is in your area, check out your home county’s tax assessor website.

If you disagree with a property tax bill on your home, you can contest it by challenging your home’s assessed valuation. You’ll need to show that the assessed value doesn’t reflect your property’s true value. If successful, your appeal could result in a lower property tax bill.
Make sure the assessment data is accurate and matches the details of your property.
Gather comparable listings or ask a real estate agent to pull records of comparable sales for you. Often, tax records are available online from the local tax assessor.
Call your assessor’s office to learn the dispute process. Aim to show that homes with similar tax values are better than yours. Start by discussing your findings by phone or in person.
If you’re unsatisfied, you might be able to pursue the case with an independent tax appeals board.
Homeowners can deduct up to $10,000 ($5,000 if married filing separately) for a combination of property taxes and either state and local income taxes or sales taxes.
You’ll need to itemize your taxes instead of taking the standard deduction if you want to deduct property tax. It’ll probably take more time to do your taxes if you itemize, but you could end up with a lower tax bill. Use Schedule A to figure your deduction.
And don't forget: You can also deduct mortgage interest on your tax return.
Failing to pay your property taxes can result in the taxing authority placing a tax lien on the property. A tax lien is a legal claim against property or financial assets you own or may have coming to you. It’s not a seizure of your assets, but it is a claim on them. If you sell the asset, the government could be entitled to some or all of the proceeds.
Buyers and sellers often discover tax liens on properties by doing a title search.

0.333333333333333,"Both a health savings account (HSA) and a flexible spending account (FSA) allow you to pay for medical care with pre-tax dollars, which reduces the cost. With healthcare accounting for 8.1% of Americans' average monthly expenses, these tax shelters are important financial tools.
But while an HSA and FSA sound similar, there are important differences between them.
HSAs provide much more flexibility on how you spend your money, while FSAs allow you to pay for both medical care and dependent care with pre-tax dollars. This guide will help you understand how the rules differ when it comes to eligibility, using account funds, and more.
If you're using the wrong credit or debit card, it could be costing you serious money.

A health savings account, or HSA, and a flexible spending account (or FSA, also called a flexible spending arrangement by the IRS) are both tax-advantaged accounts that allow you to save specifically for medical costs. Aside from that, there are several key differences between HSAs and FSAs.
Both HSAs and FSAs allow people with health insurance to set aside money for health care costs referred to by the IRS as qualified medical expenses. These include medical care, prescription drugs, dental and vision care, over-the-counter medications and other health-related items. In many cases, you receive a debit card for your account and can use it to pay for qualifying expenses. Both types of accounts have tax benefits, but there are some differences to be aware of.
In 2023, people with individual health insurance can save up to $3,850 to an HSA, and people with family coverage can save up to $7,750.
If you’re considering opening an HSA with a private insurance plan, you can deduct the year’s contributions from your taxes when you file. If your employer offers an HSA, you can fund it pretax from your paycheck or you can make tax-deductible contributions.
If your HSA custodian allows it, your funds can be invested. If you don’t spend the money on medical costs right away, the balance can grow tax-free. The balance in an HSA also rolls over year to year, so you can save to the account now and use it for medical expenses in the future, even after you no longer have an HDHP.
To contribute to an HSA, an HDHP must be your only health insurance plan, you must not be eligible for Medicare and you can't be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return. Not all plans with high deductibles qualify for HSAs, so it’s important to check with the insurer that the plan is “HSA-eligible” before you buy.
When you withdraw funds for qualified medical expenses, you don’t pay taxes on the money. If you use the money for other expenses, you’ll owe income taxes on the distribution and will be required to pay a penalty tax. Once you enroll in Medicare, you may no longer contribute to the HSA but can withdraw from it for other expenses without the penalty tax.
Like a 401(k) plan, your employer can contribute toward your HSA, and about eight out of 10 employers offer this benefit. This can help you cover the higher deductible if you have medical costs, or it can be saved for future expenses. The employer contribution counts toward your annual contribution cap.
FSA money can be “use or lose,” meaning you lose any amount you haven’t spent at the end of the year unless your employer has selected a rollover option or opted for a grace period. If your employer opts in, they can let you carry over up to $610 in 2023, or they can offer a grace period of 2½ months to spend leftover funds.
The money in an FSA comes out of your paycheck before taxes, in regular increments, but these accounts are generally “pre-funded.” In other words, though you haven’t paid in yet, the full contribution amount you selected during open enrollment is available to spend at the beginning of the year.
Although employers can contribute to health FSAs, it’s unusual for them to do so. Only about 5% of workers received employer FSA contributions in 2019, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Unlike an HSA contribution, employer contributions to health FSAs don't count toward the annual contribution cap.
In general, electing to sign up for an HSA or FSA is a good financial move. Knowing which one to select and how to get the most out of it will take some education.
You must have a high-deductible health plan, or HDHP, to save to an HSA.
Your employer must offer this benefit.
Higher contribution limits, including the option to double contributions for families.
Lower contribution limits; spouse can contribute to their own employer-sponsored FSA if available.
You can change how much you contribute to the account at any point during the year.
Contribution amounts can be adjusted only at open enrollment or with a change in employment or family status.
Unused balances roll over into the next year.
You forfeit any unused balance unless your employer allows a rollover or a grace period.
Your HSA can follow you as you change employment, and you needn’t be employed to contribute as long as you have an HDHP.
In most cases, you’ll lose your FSA with a job change. One exception: if you’re eligible for FSA continuation through COBRA.
Employers commonly offer a contribution toward an HSA, which you can use to cover health costs.
Employers can contribute toward an FSA, but most don't.
Contributions are tax-deductible, but can also be taken out of your pay pretax. Growth and distributions are tax-free if used for eligible medical expenses.
Contributions are pretax and distributions are tax-free and can only be used for eligible medical expenses.
If you qualify for an HSA, you can't elect to set up both an HSA and an FSA, unless the FSA is a “limited-purpose” FSA. Your employer’s HR representative will be able to tell you if this is the case.
A limited-purpose FSA works like a regular FSA but can be used only for things not covered under your main health insurance policy, such as vision care and dental expenses. If you expect to have high medical costs throughout the year or want to maximize contributions to your HSA while minimizing your withdrawals, using a limited-purpose FSA for expected vision and dental expenses could be a smart choice.
Both accounts have benefits that can make managing your out-of-pocket medical expenses easier throughout the year.
In general, healthier and younger people with few prescriptions or medical conditions are likely to do better with an HSA and HDHP, since they're not seeking frequent medical care or paying for regular medications.
Even though HDHPs are some of the cheapest health plans available, the trade-off is high out-of-pocket limits — as much as $15,000 for a family in 2023. If you had high medical costs, you’d still have a significant amount to pay out of pocket, even if you contributed the maximum to your HSA.
Other health plans cost more per month but cover more costs upfront. For that reason, folks with high medical costs can often find savings with a more generous plan than an HDHP, disqualifying the HSA as an option.
It's worth doing the math on any plans you're comparing: Calculate how much you'd expect to pay for both plans in yearly premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs, factoring in any employer contributions.
While FSAs offer less flexibility than HSAs, an FSA will still help you save money, and can be paired with any plan — if your employer offers it.
A good guideline as you begin thinking about how much to contribute: Start with enough to cover your deductible, expected medication costs, typical over-the-counter pharmacy spending and anticipated doctor’s visits.

0.333333333333333,"Investing in dividend-paying stocks is one of the simplest ways to earn an extra stream of income. But like most income, it's not free money. You'll have to share a piece of your earnings with the IRS in the form of taxes.
Fortunately, there are ways to trim your tax bill by understanding the ins and outs of how taxes on dividend stocks work.
There are thousands of dividend stocks to choose from, but all dividends are not created equally. If you're aiming to lower your taxes, qualified dividends are your best friend. Unlike ordinary dividends, a qualified dividend allows you to unlock the same rates as long-term capital gains. You'll gain access to the 0%, 15%, and 20% tax brackets instead of the regular federal income tax rates that could be as high as 37%.
There are special rules that need to be followed to enjoy the benefits of qualified dividends. To sum it up, a dividend is usually considered qualified if it's an ordinary dividend paid by a U.S. corporation or a qualified foreign corporation whose shares are listed on a major U.S. exchange. The underlying stock in your portfolio must be held more than 60 days during the 121-day period that began 60 days before the ex-dividend date.
Your taxable income may qualify you for a lower tax rate on dividends. If you are single and earn $445,850 or less in taxable income in 2021, you qualify for the 15% tax bracket on dividends. That number increases to $501,600 of taxable income that can be earned if you are a married couple filing together.
However, the tax brackets and rates truly work in your favor if you earn under $40,400 as a single filer and $80,800 as a married filer. You become eligible for the 0% tax rate on qualified dividends. That means you don't have to pay any income tax on those dividend deposits that flow into your account. The 2021 qualified dividend tax brackets are listed below to help you identify ways to minimize your taxes.
For single filers with taxable income of...
For married joint filers with taxable income of...
For heads of households with taxable income of...
If you own stocks in a taxable brokerage account, then you'll pay taxes on dividends as you go. But you can defer or skip the tax pain altogether by investing in an IRA. Traditional IRAs won't charge you taxes until you withdraw money from the account. Roth IRAs are even better, as this special IRA allows you to contribute money you've already paid taxes on and grow that money tax-free. All the money in the account is yours to keep after you reach 59 1/2 and have met the five-year rule.
To qualify for a Roth IRA, you need earned income for the year and your income has to fall below the thresholds. Other than that, you can start contributing up to the maximum amount into your Roth IRA every year, invest the money, and collect dividend income in your account without worrying about an annual tax bill.
Dividends provide a phenomenal opportunity to earn more money without adding more work to your to-do list. You'll also get the additional benefits of paying less taxes on dividend income than you would from working a job. If you're ready to invest in dividend-paying stocks or grow your portfolio, the tax benefits provide a great incentive to get started now. It's the perfect tax strategy to implement if you want to earn more income without drastically increasing your tax bill.

While you can’t control death, you could control how much you pay in taxes. That’s particularly true for dividend investors. After all, if you don’t manage your tax exposure, the income you get from your dividend-paying stocks could eat away at your investment gains.
While no one can avoid paying taxes altogether, there are some tax implications dividend stock investors have to pay attention to. From housing the investments in the wrong account to not taking advantage of tax-loss harvesting, here’s a look at some of the tax impacts of dividend investing.
One of the allures of dividend stocks is that they pay their investors some cash. That is very attractive to income-seeking investors in a low-interest rate environment. After all, traditional income investments like bonds aren’t seeing much gains in the current environment, which is why investors are turning to dividends. But if those dividend stocks aren’t in a tax-advantaged investment account like a 401 (K) or an IRA, the gains are going to be taxed.1 That could be a big deal, particularly for wealthy investors who are in one of the higher tax brackets.
When it comes to dividends, there are two tax treatments. The income is either taxed as a qualified dividend or an ordinary one. A qualified dividend is going to be more attractive because it’s taxed at a lower rate.1 For it to be a qualified dividend it has to be issued by a U.S. company or a foreign one that trades on a major U.S. exchange and you have to own the shares for more than 60 days of the holding period. If you are in the 35% tax bracket, a qualified dividend is going to be taxed at 15%. But if it is an ordinary dividend it will be treated as ordinary income, which means the tax hit is the same as any other income.
Some of the companies that offer investors dividends will also let them automatically use dividends to purchase more shares of the stock instead of receiving cash payments. Called dividend reinvestments, investors whose dividends are reinvested into more shares of the stock are on the hook to pay taxes on that income as if it were paid in cash without the reinvestment.
However, there can be a benefit if the dividend is received directly in the form of shares of a stock. That’s because stock dividends aren’t usually taxable until the stock is sold.
The whole idea behind investing is to make money, and dividend stocks can do that for you. But they can also create a capital gains tax event, which will reduce the gains you’ll realize. That is why tax-loss harvesting can be an important tax strategy. With tax-loss harvesting, you sell an existing holding for a loss in order to offset the gains that you generated from the sale of a winning holding.
Investors shouldn’t make decisions based on taxes alone, but they should be mindful of the potential tax event from their decisions, particularly when it comes to dividends. To ensure your tax hit isn’t eating away at your gains, investors should invest in qualified dividends, keep income investments in tax-advantaged investment accounts and engage in tax-loss harvesting to offset winners with losers.

0.333333333333333,"Warren Buffett and I don't have many things in common. He's much older than I am. He's just a wee bit wealthier, too. However, we do like some of the same stocks.
Apple (AAPL 0.06%) ranks by far as the largest stock in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. It's also easily the biggest individual stock in my personal portfolio.
I've owned Apple for years. The stock has delivered tremendous returns for me. I expect that it will continue to be a long-term winner. However, if I had to choose between Apple and Amazon (AMZN 0.82%) right now, the nod would definitely go to Amazon. Here are three compelling reasons why Amazon stock is a smarter pick than Apple in 2023.
Both Apple and Amazon have seen their share prices fall significantly. However, Amazon stock has been hit much harder. While Apple's shares are down 30% over the last 12 months, Amazon has declined nearly 50%. This steep sell-off has given Amazon its most attractive valuation in years.
Sure, Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21 is a lot lower than Amazon's multiple of 41. However, anyone who has followed Amazon for a while knows that the company's earnings can be deceiving because it invests so heavily in growth.
Amazon's price-to-sales (P/S) multiple is the lowest it's been since 2015. The stock also trades at a historically low valuation based on projected cash flow. Meanwhile, Apple's P/S multiple has fallen but remains above the level from early 2020.
The S&P 500 has fallen by 19.4% or more seven times in its entire history -- including the 2022 decline. The index has soared back by 20% or more in the year following such a steep decline since 1937. If a new bull market is indeed likely sometime this year, I think that Amazon is in a position to deliver a stronger rebound than Apple.
My reasoning is based in large part on Amazon's bigger drop over the past 12 months. Because Amazon has fallen harder than Apple has, it has more room to run when conditions improve.
More importantly, though, Amazon's performance throughout most of 2022 was more heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors than Apple's was. High inflation and fuel prices directly impacted Amazon's growth last year. Consumers cut back on spending. Organizations using Amazon Web Services (AWS) sought to lower their spending because of economic uncertainty.
A new bull market would signify that investors expect better days ahead. That should work to Amazon's benefit even more than it will for Apple.
I definitely believe that Apple has solid long-term growth opportunities. The increased adoption of 5G and new augmented reality capabilities should boost iPhone ecosystem sales. However, I think that Amazon has more tangible near-term growth opportunities.
AWS is Amazon's most important growth engine. If a recession is avoided or we only have a brief, mild one, customers could quickly resume their migration of apps and data to the cloud.
Two pending acquisitions represent especially important growth markets for Amazon. The buyout of One Medical for $3.9 billion is a significant step for Amazon in going after the huge healthcare opportunity. Amazon's deal to purchase iRobot for $1.7 billion expands the company's presence in the home device market.
Both Amazon and Apple would likely benefit from increased advertising spending if a major economic downturn is avoided. But Amazon should enjoy an even greater tailwind than Apple because it operates the third-largest digital advertising platform. Amazon's ad business has lots of room for additional growth.

Simply click below to lock in this deal!","The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s stock price per share by its earnings per share (EPS), giving investors an idea of whether a stock is under- or overvalued. A high P/E ratio may suggest that investors are expecting higher earnings growth in the future compared to companies with a lower P/E. The P/E ratio indicates the dollar amount an investor can expect to invest in a company so that they may receive one dollar of that company’s earnings. While the P/E ratio is a useful stock valuation measure, it can be misleading to investors.
One reason why the P/E ratio is considered misleading for investors is that it is based on past data (as is the case with trailing P/E) and does not guarantee that earnings will remain the same. Similarly, if the P/E ratio is based on projected earnings (for example, with a forward P/E), there is no guarantee that estimates will be accurate. Additionally, accounting techniques can control (or manipulate) financial reports.
The different ways of accounting mean that EPS can be skewed depending on the accounting methods. Skewed EPS data make it difficult for investors to accurately value a single company or compare various companies since it is impossible to know if they are comparing similar figures.
Another problem is that there is more than one way to calculate EPS. In the P/E ratio calculation, the stock price per share is set by the market. The EPS value, however, varies depending on the earnings data used. For example, whether the data is from the past 12 months or estimates for the coming year, analysts can use earnings estimates to determine the relative value of a company at a future level of earnings—a value known as the forward P/E.
Comparing one company’s P/E ratio based on trailing earnings to another’s forward earnings creates an apples-to-oranges comparison that can be misleading to investors. For these reasons, investors would be wise to use more than the P/E ratio when evaluating a company or comparing various companies.
The P/E ratio is calculated using earnings per share, but EPS can be skewed depending on the accounting methods. Skewed EPS data makes it impossible to compare one company with another.
A primary limitation of using P/E ratios becomes evident when investors compare the P/E ratios of different companies. Valuations and business models may vary wildly across sectors, and it is best to use P/E as a comparative tool for stocks within the same sector rather than multiple sectors.
A quick look at P/E ratios for Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) illustrates the dangers of using only the P/E ratio to evaluate a company. In mid-December, 2018, Apple traded at $165.48 with a P/E ratio (TTM) of 13.89.12 On the same day, Amazon’s stock price was $1,591.91 with a P/E ratio of 89.19.34 One of the reasons Amazon’s P/E is so much higher than Apple's is that its efforts to expand aggressively on a wide scale have helped keep earnings somewhat suppressed and the P/E ratio high.
The P/E ratio should be used with a variety of other analysis tools to analyze a stock.
If these two stocks were compared based on P/E alone, it would be impossible to make a reasonable evaluation. A low P/E ratio does not automatically mean a stock is undervalued. Similarly, a high P/E ratio does not necessarily mean a company is overvalued.

0.333333333333333,"It has been a tough ride for Peloton Interactive (PTON 0.23%), whose shares have cratered 95% over the last year and a half. The pandemic was definitely good to the fitness innovator, as stuck-at-home consumers turned to convenient options to work out at home. But a reopening economy caused demand to fall and net losses to soar.
To help keep costs under control and improve the financial situation, management just announced that they will halt all in-house production of the company's exercise equipment and will instead rely solely on third-party manufacturers. This latest move has the potential to better position Peloton to be sustainably profitable sooner rather than later, something I'm sure investors desperately want.
In addition to suspending operations at Tonic Fitness Technology, a Taiwanese manufacturer that was acquired in Oct. 2019 for $48 million, and expanding its partnership agreement with Rexon Industrial, Peloton previously announced that it will sell the planned $400 million Ohio factory, called Peloton Output Park. Furthermore, this pivot calls into question what the company will do with its acquisition of Precor, which was purchased to boost manufacturing capabilities.
It's obvious in hindsight that the previous CEO, John Foley, overinvested in the hopes that the pandemic surge in demand would continue well into the future. But with physical gyms getting back to full strength, as well as worries of a potential economic slowdown, Peloton is facing a difficult time right now.
Unsurprisingly, Peloton was last profitable during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic. In 2020's second quarter, the business produced positive net income of $89.1 million with a margin of 14.7%. Over the past four quarters, however, Peloton has posted a cumulative net loss of $1.9 billion. For comparison's sake, the company's entire market capitalization is just $2.8 billion.
It's strikingly clear that the current management team, led by new CEO Barry McCarthy, has a primary objective of getting the financials of the business in order. Consequently, shareholders shouldn't be surprised by a huge change in direction like this one.
Owning your own factories and producing goods in-house benefits a company if it can reach mass scale, at which point the per-unit cost of merchandise is lowered and profitability can skyrocket. But this strategy also comes with drawbacks, mainly if a business isn't seeing as much demand as it had initially expected. If revenue doesn't meet or exceed what management had forecast, then the fixed costs of owning the manufacturing process will simply result in higher losses. We've seen this play out for Peloton.
On the other hand, outsourcing manufacturing is exactly what Peloton needs at this point in time. McCarthy is aiming for financial flexibility with a more variable cost structure. This is critical right now because Peloton has been facing an environment where it has been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to forecast demand with any level of certainty. Outsourcing manufacturing means that the business will only pay for each piece of equipment that gets made, and not directly for owning the actual factory itself.
Apple (AAPL 0.06%), for example, outsources the manufacturing of nearly all of its hardware products to other companies. And it has the most successful product of all time in the iPhone. Even with such massive demand, Apple has decided to focus on the design and software components as opposed to assembling the hardware, something Peloton wants to start doing now.
I certainly applaud Barry McCarthy so far. He took over a troubled business that was facing a laundry list of issues, and he has taken major steps to right the ship. While the latest decision to cut all in-house manufacturing in favor of an outsourced model appears to be the correct move, what really matters is if Peloton can drive higher demand for its exercise equipment, which will increase subscribers. Hopefully, this raises the chances that the company can generate positive free cash flow starting in fiscal 2023.
And this is what will ultimately move the stock price over the long term.

0.333333333333333,"Even if you're new to the world of financial technology, you've probably heard the buzz around consumer finance innovators SoFi Technologies (SOFI -1.80%), Upstart Holdings (UPST -2.64%), and LendingClub (LC -2.19%). SoFi, which went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company this year, offers the broadest array of financial products and services of these three. Upstart went public at the end of 2020 and has seen its shares climb more than 700% since its first day of trading. LendingClub, which has been public since 2014, is more or less the underdog here, with its stock falling under $5 last summer but quickly turning around after the company completed a key acquisition this year.
There has been much debate over which of the three is the superior company and better investment opportunity, so let's take a look.
All three of these companies have disruptive business models, using technology and artificial intelligence to acquire customers more easily than traditional banks and approve loans quicker.
SoFi has three main businesses. Its lending segment offers student loan refinancing, in-school loans, personal loans, and home mortgages. It also has a financial services business that offers credit cards, cash management accounts, and a brokerage for members to invest in equities and cryptocurrencies, along with other products. Finally, in 2020, SoFi acquired Galileo, a platform that helps other fintechs carry out front- and back-end functions such as account setup, account funding, and direct deposit. It's also in the process of acquiring a bank -- this is big because a bank charter will let it gather deposits, which will help it fund loans more cheaply and cut down on other expenses in the loan origination process. SoFi's strategy is to become a one-stop shop for consumers. By getting them to purchase multiple financial products, SoFi can greatly cut down on customer acquisition costs and increase profitability. SoFi has already amassed more than 2.5 million members.
Upstart originates unsecured personal loans and auto loans by leveraging AI to determine the true risk of the borrower and make faster loan decisions. In 2020, 21% of the loans funded by Upstart were retained by the originating banks and 77% of loans were purchased by institutional investors.
LendingClub is also in the business of leveraging AI and data to originate unsecured personal loans. It also wants to get more into auto lending eventually and build a world-class checking account for its customers that will reward them for making loan payments. It is the only one of these three companies that currently has a bank charter. Earlier this year, LendingClub completed its acquisition of Radius Bank. As a result, it has cut down on funding costs and expenses by using cheap deposits to fund its loans and by no longer having to use third-party banks to originate all of its loans. LendingClub not only sells loans to banks and investors, it also plans to retain 15% to 25% of originations on its balance sheet and collect recurring monthly loan payments. The company has 3.5 million members.
SoFi's second-quarter results disappointed investors, as the loss the company reported widely missed the consensus estimate from analysts. However, $144 million of the company's $165 million loss was due to non-cash and one-time expenses. Membership growth slowed a bit in the quarter, while Galileo continued to add new accounts and SoFi Invest significantly grew revenue. The company also scaled back revenue guidance from its student loan refinance business due to the unexpected extension of a federal moratorium on student loan payments and less revenue on Galileo than expected.
By the numbers, Upstart had the most successful Q2 of the group, generating a profit close to $0.40 per share, beating expectations, and raising its guidance for the year from $600 million of revenue to $750 million. Investors rewarded the company, sending shares 56% higher since it reported earnings.
LendingClub completely blew out analysts' expectations and management's own guidance in Q2, turning a profit several quarters before the Street expected, and demonstrating that its digital marketplace bank concept that combines putting loans on the balance sheet and selling them to banks and investors is working better than expected. Since LendingClub reported earnings on July 28, its stock has soared more than 70%. Management has also revised up its full-year guidance, now projecting originations between $9.8 billion and $10.2 billion, revenue of $750 million to $780 million, and a full-year loss between $13 million and $3 million. Origination and revenue guidance has now tripled from the beginning of the year, while the loss estimate is down from a $140 million to $159 million loss earlier this year.
If you look at my disclosure below, you'll see that I've already put my investment dollars behind one of these fintechs. I believe LendingClub is the best investment opportunity of the three, and I've been buying shares and call options since March. This is because the acquisition of Radius and its bank charter has been so transformational for the business, and on such an accelerated timeline.
LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn has said that holding loans on the balance sheet will eventually be three times more profitable than selling them to investors. Additionally, Sanborn said obtaining a bank charter has been instrumental for the marketplace platform because banks and investors now know LendingClub is held to the same regulatory standards as they are, and is now taking the credit risk itself by holding a portion of the loans, which creates more trust. Being able to hold loans on the balance sheet also gives LendingClub pricing power in the marketplace, because if investors and banks don't want to pay a certain fee for the loan, LendingClub can simply put it on its balance sheet. And by only retaining 15% to 25%, LendingClub can retain loans from higher-quality borrowers.
I think SoFi and Upstart are strong companies, but while Upstart has begun to tap into the auto market, and SoFi offers many products, LendingClub has managed to quickly catch up to their pace solely with its expertise in unsecured personal lending. Soon, the company will get into the auto space and is in the process of building a checking account to roll out to its 3.5 million members. I find it interesting that SoFi talks about the potential to drive better margins by cross-selling multiple products to its members. While that is undoubtedly true, LendingClub in Q2 generated significant operating leverage (growth rate of revenue minus the growth rate of expenses) without cross-selling anything. And for how much Upstart talks up its AI capabilities -- the company says it's using 15 billion cells of data to inform its algorithmic models -- LendingClub says it uses more (148 billion cells).
Regardless of whose business is better -- and I am sure there is a good debate to be had here -- there is clearly a valuation gap. LendingClub has a market cap of $2.6 billion at Wednesday's prices, SoFi has a market cap of $11.4 billion, and Upstart has a market cap of $16.5 billion. SoFi is projecting more full-year revenue and Upstart expects to generate a higher profit, but remember that Q2 was really the first full quarter that LendingClub had its new digital marketplace concept intact. The company still only trades at 3.5 times full-year estimated revenue. I suspect the market is being tough on LendingClub due to past controversies at the company, so I think if the company can generate a few more consistent quarters of earnings, the market will reward the stock more. If you believe in SoFi and Upstart's valuation, then LendingClub should still look undervalued, given the numbers the company just put up and is projecting going forward.

Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money.
SoFi and LendingClub are two options for unsecured personal loans. Both offer loans for debt consolidation, home improvements and other purposes.
For borrowers with strong credit and income, we give SoFi the edge over LendingClub because it offers a lower range of rates plus no fees.
Here’s a side-by-side comparison of SoFi and LendingClub. We always recommend borrowers compare personal loans — including rates, terms and features — before applying.
Your credit score and income are strong enough to get you the lowest rate.
You want no origination or late fees.
You want a large loan amount.
Founded in 2011, SoFi is an online finance company that offers personal loans as well as student loan refinancing, mortgages and financial planning. It provides personal loans up to $100,000 — an unusually large loan amount among online lenders — plus perks like unemployment protection and career coaching.
How to qualify: SoFi does not have a minimum credit score requirement. The company says borrowers with good or excellent credit are the most likely to qualify.
The company also requires applicants to be employed, have sufficient income from other sources or have an offer to begin employment within 90 days.
You can apply with a co-borrower, which may help you qualify for a loan or get a lower rate. Co-borrowers have access to the funds and share responsibility for loan payments.
Approval to funding time: SoFi says it can fund loans the same day after approval.
Costs: SoFi offers fixed-rate loans at very competitive annual percentage rates and an autopay discount of 0.25 percentage points.
SoFi personal loans carry no origination fees, prepayment penalties, late fees or overdraft fees.
Repayment flexibility: SoFi allows borrowers to change their payment due date once every 12 months if they’re in good standing. The company also offers forbearance — temporary suspension of payments — for three months at a time if you lose your job at no fault of your own. Interest continues to accrue on suspended loans.
Good option for: SoFi loans work best for debt consolidation and funding large one-time expenses, such as home improvements. The lender offers high borrowing amounts, low rates and no fees. You’ll need good credit and strong income to qualify.
You want a smaller loan.
You want to add a co-borrower.
You have a lower credit score.
LendingClub is a fit for fair- to good-credit borrowers and offers loans ranging from $1,000 to $40,000 that can be used for many purposes, including debt consolidation, home improvements and medical expenses.
How to qualify: LendingClub's minimum credit score is 600, though the average credit score for its borrowers is 700. It requires a minimum credit history of 37 months, and single applicants must have a debt-to-income ratio of less than 60%. On joint applications, the borrowers' combined DTI ratio must be under 40%.
Approval to funding time: LendingClub may take up to two days to fund loans, slightly longer than SoFi.
Costs: LendingClub’s APRs range higher than SoFi's, and they include a one-time origination fee from 1% to 6% of the loan amount. The fee is deducted from the loan proceeds.
If a monthly payment is 15 days late, LendingClub charges a late fee of 5% of the payment or $15, whichever is greater.
Good option for: LendingClub loans work best for debt consolidation and for those who want to apply with a joint application.

NerdWallet’s review process evaluates and rates personal loan products from more than 35 financial institutions. We collect over 45 data points from each lender, interview company representatives and compare the lender with others that seek the same customer or offer a similar personal loan product. NerdWallet writers and editors conduct a full fact check and update annually, but also make updates throughout the year as necessary.
Our star ratings award points to lenders that offer consumer-friendly features, including: soft credit checks to pre-qualify, competitive interest rates and no fees, transparency of rates and terms, flexible payment options, fast funding times, accessible customer service, reporting of payments to credit bureaus and financial education. We also consider regulatory actions filed by agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We weigh these factors based on our assessment of which are the most important to consumers and how meaningfully they impact consumers’ experiences.
This methodology applies only to lenders that cap interest rates at 36%, the maximum rate most financial experts and consumer advocates agree is the acceptable limit for a loan to be affordable.

0.319148936170213,"If you're deciding between Webull vs. Robinhood, the good news is that you can't go wrong with either broker. Both offer commission-free trades, access to a wide range of asset classes and full-featured mobile apps. But there are some important differences in terms of how the apps perform, the trades you can make, and more.
Read on to learn more about where Webull and Robinhood shine -- and where they fall short -- to decide on the brokerage firm that's best for you.
Both Webull and Robinhood market themselves as commission-free and fee-free brokers. They largely live up to that promise. You won't pay a commission for buying stocks, ETFs, options trading, or cryptocurrencies with either brokerage firm. Neither charges account maintenance fees.
However, if you want access to Robinhood Gold -- which is necessary to gain access to advanced data, market research, and the best margin rates -- you'll need to pay $5 per month.
And you'll have to download a separate Webull Pay app to trade crypto through the company. Robinhood has a separate crypto app as well, but you can trade many currencies directly from the main Robinhood app, no extra downloads required.
Both Webull and Robinhood provide access to stocks, ETFs, and options. Fractional share trading is also available from both brokers, although Webull requires a minimum $5 investment while Robinhood allows you to buy as little as 1/1000000 of a share.
Neither Webull nor Robinhood provide access to mutual funds, CDs, bonds, futures, or currencies. If you're hoping to add these asset classes to your portfolio, you'll need a different brokerage account to do it.
Robinhood and Webull both allow cryptocurrency trading, although Webull's selection of available cryptocurrencies outpaces Robinhood's. If you're primarily interested in crypto trading, it's worth taking this into account.
Robinhood and Webull both offer a taxable brokerage account, but neither provides access to a joint or custodial account.
Both Webull and Robinhood allow you to open traditional and Roth IRAs. Robinhood offers a 1% match on IRA contributions, rising to 3% for Robinhood Gold subscribers.
Webull offers a high-yield cash management account. Deposits earn interest and Webull charges zero monthly fees. Your money is FDIC insured.
Robinhood offers a spending account with a linked debit card that earns rewards, but spending account deposits don't earn interest. Instead, Robinhood offers an optional ""brokerage cash sweeps"" program that earns customers interest on uninvested cash. Robinhood Gold members earn the most.
Only Webull offers robo-advisor services. It charges an annualized fee of 0.2%, low for the industry, and requires a $100 minimum deposit. Feel free to compare it to some of the best robo-advisors out there.
Both Webull and Robinhood are heavily focused on mobile apps and allow trading on the go -- although Webull has a full-featured desktop app as well).
Both brokers' apps are highly rated, with Webull earning 4.7 out of 5 stars on the iOS store and the Robinhood app receiving a 4.2 star rating.
Both Webull and Robinhood are great options for the mobile-first investor who is interested in being able to easily trade stocks, ETFs, fractional shares, and cryptocurrencies.
Those who prefer easier access to technical data may prefer Webull. On the other hand, Robinhood's intuitive trading platform makes it an ideal choice for investors hoping to keep things simple.
Since both brokers charge no commission and offer full-featured apps, the right choice comes down to a matter of which interface is a better fit for your needs.
We recommend comparing brokerage options to ensure the account you're selecting is the best fit for you. To make your search easier, here's a short list of our best trading platforms of 2024.
Generally speaking, Robinhood is better for investors who prioritize simplicity and a clean user experience. Webull caters to investors who want more choices and technical features, such as advanced dashboard and robo-advisory services.
You may want to switch to Webull if you want a technical charts, a robo-advisor, or a place to earn interest on cash that's separate from univested brokerage cash.

0.318181818181818,"There is a class of high-yield investment you might not have heard about: master limited partnerships, or MLPs. This kind of investment is renowned for its high and potentially fast-growing yield, and it can also return superior total returns over time. However, before investing in this asset class there are certain tax ramifications, both good and bad, that potential MLP investors need to be aware of. Let's review what they are and how you can adjust your portfolio accordingly to build both wealth and income over time.
MLPs made simpleMLPs are publicly traded limited partnerships that must legally derive at least 90% of their cash flows from real estate, natural resources, or commodities.
MLPs are pass-through entities, meaning they don't pay taxes on their earnings as long as they pass the vast majority of them on to investors as distributions. Typically 80% to 90% of the distribution is in the form of return of capital, or ROC, which is a fancy way of saying that, thanks to numerous write-offs and depreciations the partnership takes on its equipment, most of your payout is tax deferred. The exact breakdown of taxable income versus ROC is shown in the K-1 form, which the partnership sends out to all investors annually.
Since the biggest differences between corporations and MLPs comes at tax time to decide whether MLPs are right for you, there are three things you need to consider.
Fact one: More complicated tax preparationThe K-1 is often considered a major downside to owning MLPs, because it can complicate tax preparation. Fortunately, accountants and software such as TurboTax can make this process far less arduous.
Another thing to know about MLP taxes is that owning one in a tax-deferred account such as an IRA can be suboptimal because of UBTI, or unrelated business taxable income, which is something MLPs can sometimes generate during their operations. If your holdings are big enough that your total UBTI tax bill (per your K-1) is over $1,000, then you'll need to pay taxes on that UBTI income, even though the MLP is held in a tax-deferred account.
Fact two: Major tax benefitsYou might be wondering, with all the added tax hassles, why anyone invests in MLPs. Well, for two main reasons. First, they're known for high, growing, and sustainable yields -- as high as 13% and some MLPs, such as Linn Energy, (NASDAQ: LINE) pay monthly distributions.
The second reason has to do with the tax benefits of MLPs. The way ROC works is that rather than pay taxes right away, you deduct them from your cost basis. Then when you sell units of MLPs, you pay taxes on your units sold. This can have a powerful long-term benefit. For example, say you invested $10,000 in an MLP. If you hold the units long enough, eventually your cost basis will go to $0. As long as you don't sell, then $10,000 of otherwise taxable income will be permanently deferred from the IRS. You can pass on MLP units to your heirs, and as long as they don't sell them, they don't have to pay taxes, either. However, this only applies as long as your cost basis is above zero.
As a result of these tax benefits, MLPs get a bit more complicated. For example, if you do sell your units of an MLP, some of the profit will be taxed as long-term capital gains, and some will be ""recaptured"" (taxed as ordinary income). This includes things like depreciation, inventory appreciation, and unrealized receivables. This information can be found in the annual K-1 your MLP will send you.
What about after your cost basis has hit zero? Then most of the ROC is taxed as long-term capital gains. Herein lies the true benefit of MLPs, because long-term capital gains taxes are much lower than regular income tax levels.
For the vast majority of investors, the capital gains taxes paid on income earned by MLPs, once the cost basis has hit zero, is 0% or 15%. Even if you're in the top tax bracket, you end up paying half the tax rate compared with what you would pay if distributions were taxed as ordinary income.
Fact three: Complications with owning MLPs in retirement accountsWhat if you want to own MLPs in a tax-deferred account such as an IRA or 401(k)? While you sometimes can do this, there are several things to keep in mind.
First, some brokers won't allow MLPs to be owned in such accounts, so check with your broker to see if they have such limitations.
Second, because tax-deferred accounts are already offsetting your income taxes, the tax benefits of MLPs are largely wasted, which is why many financial advisors recommend owning MLPs in taxable accounts to maximize their tax benefits.
Third, as long as your total account UBTI is under $1,000 then your retirement account won't generate any extra taxes. However, any UBTI above $1,000 must be declared and is taxed at 39.6% (the highest marginal tax rates applied to trusts).
Finally, there are several alternatives to MLPs that can be owned in retirement accounts that allow you to experience the high-yield, dividend growth benefits of these partnerships without the tax headaches.
The key is that the investments need to be regular corporations, which won't give you any of the deferred tax benefits of an MLP. One such example is LinnCo (NASDAQ: LNCO), which exists purely to own units of Linn Energy and uses its distributions to pay regular monthly dividends. As it's a regular corporation, you can own it in a tax-deferred retirement account because it doesn't incur any UBTI.
Another way to own MLPs in a retirement account without incurring UBTI is with MLPs that pay distributions in the form of shares instead of cash. These MLPs are usually structured to own units of an affiliated MLP and sometimes manage its assets. One example of such an MLP is Enbridge Energy Management LLC (NYSE: EEQ), which manages (and owns 17% of) Enbridge Energy Partners (NYSE: EEP) that currently pays a stock dividend equal to a yield of 6.21%.
Bottom lineMLPs can make some of the best income investments you can buy. However, investors need to be aware of the three biggest tax ramifications of owning these assets which are: more complicated tax preparation, complications with owning them in retirement accounts, and the need to hold them for many years to maximize their full tax benefits. If you're interested, I recommend you research the MLPs and companies mentioned here, as well as take a look at the free report below.

There are significant tax benefits to owning units in a master limited partnership (MLP). While they have benefits in the view of taxes, they may not be the best security to hold in an individual retirement account (IRA).
Distributions from MLPs to unit holders receive favorable tax treatment under the IRS code. An MLP is a pass-through entity, and partnership income is only taxed at the level of the partner.1 Distributions are not taxed when they are received, unlike stock dividends, which are taxed the year they are realized. Instead, the distributions are considered a reduction in the cost basis of the MLP investment. If you hold the MLP long enough and your cost basis reaches zero, distributions are taxed as capital gains in the year of distribution.
Since MLP tax liability is deferred, it is not the best candidate to hold in an IRA. Income from an MLP is not taxed at the corporate level, which avoids the common problem of double taxation for corporations. At tax time, the investor receives a K-1 schedule from the MLP stating the investor's portion of the MLP's net income.1 This MLP income is not tax-deferred if the units are held in an IRA. Holding this security in an IRA account eliminates the tax benefits of an MLP investment.
A downside of holding MLPs is that many of them invest in pipelines that run through several states. You may have to pay state income taxes, but some states offer exemptions.

0.316091954022989,"You may have heard that investing in stocks can be a great way to create wealth over time. That's certainly true.
But do you really know how the stock market works? Do you know what makes a stock market different from a stock exchange or stock index? Do you know what a stock is?
If you answered no to any of these, you aren't alone. The stock market can seem like a very complex and confusing place.
It doesn't have to be. The basics of the stock market are less complicated than you might think. With that in mind, here's a rundown of the basics of stock markets, stock exchanges, and stock indexes.
Before we get into stock markets, you need to understand stocks and how they work on a basic level. Here are a few basic concepts that can help new investors understand how the stock market works.
Stocks represent an ownership interest in businesses that choose to have their shares available to public investors. These are known as publicly traded companies. You may also hear stocks referred to as equities or equity securities.
A share of stock represents an ownership interest in a company. If you buy a share of Apple (AAPL  0.06%), you own a small part of the business and get to share in the company's success.
Instead of being owned by an individual or a private group, some companies (such as Apple) choose to ""go public"" with an IPO. This means that anyone can become a part owner by purchasing shares of the company's stock. There are thousands of public companies you can choose to buy stock in.
How does the stock market work? There are entire books explaining the stock market, and there's too much to explain in a few paragraphs.
The good news is you don't need to get too deep to gain a good basic understanding of the stock market. Stock markets facilitate the sale and purchase of stocks between individual investors, institutional investors, and companies.
The vast majority of stock trades take place between investors. If you want to buy shares of Microsoft (MSFT  2.11%), you can hit the ""buy"" button through your broker's website. When you do, you are buying shares that another investor has decided to sell -- not from Microsoft itself. By purchasing shares of a stock, you become an investor in the company.
Stock prices on exchanges are governed by supply and demand, plain and simple.
At any given time, there's a maximum price someone is willing to pay for a certain stock, known as the bid price. There's also a minimum price someone else is willing to set for the shares of stock, known as the ask price.
Think of stock market trading like an auction. Buyers are constantly bidding for the stocks that other investors are willing to sell.
If there is a lot of demand for a stock, investors will buy shares quicker than sellers want to get rid of them. This can move the price higher. On the other hand, if more investors are selling a stock than buying, the market price will drop.
There are plenty of catalysts that can push the market up or down. For example, in the recent stock market downturn, big reasons for the market's poor performance included inflation pressures, supply chain issues, rising interest rates, and recession fears. These factors resulted in more investors selling stock than buying, which is why we saw stock prices generally decline.
Taking it a step further, it's important to consider how it's almost always possible to buy or sell a stock you own. That's where market makers come in.
A key concept when it comes to understanding the stock market is the idea of a market maker.
Think of it this way. There aren't always buyers to match up with sellers of stocks. However, stock trades typically go through in seconds. How can brokers buy and sell stocks in your account instantaneously?
Because of market makers, you'll never have to wait to sell stocks at their full market value. You don't need to wait until a buyer wants your exact number of shares. If you choose to sell, a market maker will buy your shares right away.
Investors must carry out the transactions of buying or selling stocks through a broker. In a nutshell, a broker is simply an entity licensed to trade stocks on a stock exchange.
A broker may be an actual person whom you tell what to buy and sell. More commonly, it is an online stock broker -- say, Schwab or Fidelity. Firms like these process the entire transaction electronically.
Often when discussing the stock market, people generalize ""the market"" to a stock index. Stock indexes, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average, are a representation of the performance of a large group of stocks or a particular stock market sector.
These are used as a benchmark to compare the performance of individual stocks or an entire portfolio. For example, the S&P 500 index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S.
Indexes are a convenient way to discuss an approximation of what is happening in the market. However, it's important to understand that the major stock indexes you see on TV and in the news do not fully represent the entire stock market.
When someone says ""the market is up"" or that a stock ""beat the market,"" they are usually referring to a stock index.

The stock market provides a venue where companies raise capital by selling shares of stock, or equity, to investors. Stocks give shareholders voting rights as well as a residual claim on corporate earnings in the form of capital gains and dividends.
Individual and institutional investors come together on stock exchanges to buy and sell shares in a public market. When you buy a share of stock on the stock market, you are not buying it from the company, you are buying it from an existing shareholder.
What happens when you sell a stock? You do not sell your shares back to the company, but instead, sell them to another investor on the exchange.
A stock is a financial instrument that represents ownership in a company or corporation and a proportionate claim on its assets and earnings. Stocks are also called shares or equity.
Owning stock means that a shareholder owns a slice of the company equal to the number of shares held as a proportion of the company's total outstanding shares.
An individual or entity that owns 100,000 shares of a company with one million outstanding shares would have a 10% ownership stake in it.
Stocks are also called shares or a company's equity.
Stock exchanges are secondary markets where existing shareholders can transact with potential buyers. Corporations listed on stock markets do not commonly buy and sell their shares but may engage in stock buybacks or issue new shares but these transactions occur outside of the framework of the exchange.
The first stock markets appeared in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, mainly in port cities or trading hubs such as Antwerp, Amsterdam, and London. In the late 18th century, stock markets began appearing in America, notably the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which allowed for equity shares to trade.
The first stock exchange in America was the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), which still exists today.3 The NYSE was founded in 1792 with the signing of the Buttonwood Agreement by 24 New York City stockbrokers and merchants. Before this official incorporation, traders and brokers would meet unofficially under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street to buy and sell shares.
The advent of modern stock markets ushered in an age of regulation and professionalization that now ensures buyers and sellers of shares can trust that their transactions will go through at fair prices and within a reasonable period. Today, there are many stock exchanges in the U.S. and throughout the world, many of which are linked together electronically.
In most developed countries, stock exchanges are self-regulatory organizations (SROs), non-governmental organizations that have the power to create and enforce industry regulations and standards.
The priority for stock exchanges is to protect investors through the establishment of rules that promote ethics and equality. Examples of such SROs in the U.S. include individual stock exchanges, as well as the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
Indices represent aggregated prices of several different stocks, and the movement of an index is the net effect of the movements of each component. Major stock market indexes include theDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the S&P 500.
Indices can be broad such as the Dow Jones or S&P 500, or they can be specific to a certain industry or market sector. Investors can trade indices indirectly via futures markets, or via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which act just like stocks on stock exchanges.
To make the transition from an idea germinating in an entrepreneur's brain to an operating company, they need to lease an office or factory, hire employees, buy equipment and raw materials, and put in place a sales and distribution network, among other things. These resources require significant amounts of capital, depending on the scale and scope of the business.
A startup can raise capital either by selling shares through equity financing or borrowing money through debt financing. Debt financing can be a problem for a startup because it may have few assets to pledge for a loan.
Equity financing is the preferred route for most startups that need capital. The entrepreneur may initially source funds from personal savings, as well as friends and family, to get the business off the ground. As the business expands and its capital requirements become more substantial, the entrepreneur may turn to angel investors and venture capital firms.
Companies can access larger amounts of capital than they can get from ongoing operations or a traditional bank loan by selling shares to the public through an initial public offering (IPO).
This changes the status of the company from a private firm whose shares are held by a few shareholders to a publicly-traded company whose shares will be held by numerous members of the general public. The IPO also offers early investors in the company an opportunity to cash out part of their stake, often reaping very handsome rewards in the process.
Once the company's shares are listed on a stock exchange and trading on the market, the price of these shares fluctuates as investors and traders assess and reassess their intrinsic value. There are many different ratios and metrics that can be used to value stocks, of which the single-most popular measure is probably the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. Stock analysis tends to fall into one of two camps—fundamental analysis, or technical analysis.
The prices of shares on a stock market can be set in several ways. The most common way is through an auction process where buyers and sellers place bids and offer to buy or sell. A bid is a price at which somebody wishes to buy, and an offer, or ask, is the price at which somebody wishes to sell. When the bid and ask coincide, a trade is made.
The stock market also offers a fascinating example of the laws of supply and demand at work in real time. For every stock transaction, there must be a buyer and a seller. Because of the immutable laws of supply and demand, if there are more buyers for a specific stock than there are sellers of it, the stock price will trend up. Conversely, if there are more sellers of the stock than buyers, the price will trend down.
The bid-ask or bid-offer spread, the difference between the bid price for a stock and its ask or offer price, represents the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay or bid for a stock and the lowest price at which a seller is offering the stock.
A trade transaction occurs either when a buyer accepts the asking price or a seller takes the bid price. If buyers outnumber sellers, they may be willing to raise their bids to acquire the stock. Sellers will, therefore, ask higher prices for it, ratcheting the price up. If sellers outnumber buyers, they may be willing to accept lower offers for the stock, while buyers will also lower their bids, effectively forcing the price down.
Some stock markets rely on professional traders to maintain continuous bids and offers since a motivated buyer or seller may not find each other at any given moment. These are known as specialists or market makers.
A two-sided market consists of the bid and the offer, and the spread is the difference in price between the bid and the offer. The more narrow the price spread and the larger size of the bids and offers, the greater the liquidity of the stock. If there are many buyers and sellers at sequentially higher and lower prices, the market is said to have good depth.
The original manual method of trading was based on a system known as the open outcry system, where traders used verbal and hand signal communications to buy and sell large blocks of stocks in the trading pit or the exchange floor.
However, the open outcry system has been superseded by electronic trading systems at most exchanges. These systems can match buyers and sellers far more efficiently and rapidly, resulting in significant benefits such as lower trading costs and faster trade execution.
High-quality stock markets tend to have small bid-ask spreads, high liquidity, and good depth, which means that individual stocks of high quality, large companies tend to have the same characteristics.
Many giant startups choose to get listed on an exchange at a much later stage than startups from a decade or two ago.
While this delayed listing may partly be attributable to the drawbacks listed above, the main reason could be that well-managed startups with a compelling business proposition have access to unprecedented amounts of capital from sovereign wealth funds, private equity, and venture capitalists. Such access to seemingly unlimited amounts of capital would make an IPO and exchange listing much less of a pressing issue for a startup.
While the allure of buying a stock similar to one of the fabled FAANG quintet—Meta, Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)—at a very early stage is one of the more tantalizing prospects of stock investing, in reality, such home runs are few and far between.
Investment often depends on an individual's tolerance for risk. Risky investors may generate most of their returns from capital gains rather than dividends. On the other hand, investors who are conservative and require income from their portfolios may opt for stocks that have a long history of paying substantial dividends.
While stocks can be classified in several ways, two of the most common are by market capitalization and by sector. Market cap refers to the total market value of a company's outstanding shares and is calculated by multiplying these shares by the current market price of one share.
This sector classification makes it easy for investors to tailor their portfolios according to their risk tolerance and investment preference. Conservative investors with income needs may weigh their portfolios toward sectors whose constituent stocks have better price stability and offer attractive dividends through so-called defensive sectors such as consumer staples, health care, and utilities. Aggressive investors may prefer more volatile sectors such as information technology, financials, and energy.
Inflation refers to an increase in consumer prices, either due to an oversupply of money or a shortage of consumer goods. The effects of inflation on the stock market are unpredictable: in some cases, it can lead to higher share prices, due to more money entering the market and increased job growth. However, higher input prices can also restrict corporate earnings, causing profits to fall. Overall, value stocks tend to perform better than growth stocks in times of high inflation.
The S&P 500 has grown about 10.5% per year since it was established in the 1920s. Using this as a barometer for market growth, one can estimate that the stock market grows in value by about the same amount each year. However, there is an element of probability: in some years the stock market sees greater growth, and in some years it grows less. In addition, some stocks grow faster than others.
Most people who lose money in the stock market do so through reckless investments in high-risk securities. Although these can score high returns if they are successful, they are just as likely to lose money. There is also an element of psychology: an investor who sells during a crash will lock in their losses, while those who hold their stock have a chance of seeing their patience rewarded. Finally, margin trading can make the stock market even riskier, by magnifying one's potential gains or losses.
Stock markets represent the heartbeat of the market, and experts often use stock prices as a barometer of economic health. But the importance of stock markets goes beyond mere speculation. By allowing companies to sell their shares to thousands or millions of retail investors, stock markets also represent an important source of capital for public companies.

0.313953488372093,"What is an IUL? An IUL is a type of permanent life insurance, meaning it can accumulate cash value and provide a death benefit. Like other types of whole life policies -- including universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance -- index life insurance is sold as an insurance-investment hybrid.
As cash value builds, insurance companies tie its value to a market index, like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500. Or an insurer could decide to connect cash value to markets most everyday people have never heard of, like the Hang Seng Index. The insurance company decides which market the funds will be tied to, although they don't actually invest the money in the market. Instead, they use their chosen market to determine how much the money is worth at any given time -- up to a cap. The cap rate is normally somewhere around 10% to 12%, so if the market is enjoying a bull market and the value of stocks is soaring, money invested in an IUL will increase in value up to 10% to 12%.
If the market the insurance company has chosen tanks, IUL insurance typically includes a guaranteed rate of growth. The rate varies by insurance carrier.
Unlike term life insurance, an IUL policy lasts the policyholder's entire life, as long as premiums are kept up to date. That said, as a policyholder ages, the cost of the policy increases. A policyholder may be able to adjust their premium payment by lowering their death benefit.
After enough cash has accumulated, a policyholder can borrow from their IUL, although they can expect to pay interest on the loan. If they don't pay it back in full, the amount owed will be deducted from their death benefit.
When the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed in 2010, IUL policies were exempted from federal regulation. Unlike stocks and options, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not regulate IUL insurance. Further, agents who sell IUL insurance are rarely required to undergo the same training as a stock broker and may be less equipped to provide sound investment advice.
Like all financial products, IUL policies have some benefits. Here are a few worth knowing about.
For someone who doesn't trust themselves to save money, an IUL acts as a forced savings account. Because part of each premium goes toward cash value, once the premium is out of their hands, the insurance company does the rest.
IUL death benefits are distributed tax free to beneficiaries. In addition, the policyholder can withdraw up to the amount they have contributed toward cash accumulated tax free. Once they begin withdrawing earnings on the money, funds are taxed as regular income.
If a policyholder needs money and their IUL has accumulated enough cash, they may borrow against that money. If they fail to repay the loan with interest, the outstanding cash value will be subtracted from the policy death benefit.
Say a person purchases an IUL in their early 30s but is diagnosed with a rare disease 30 years later. As long as that person pays their premiums, they continue to be covered, regardless of their health.
Unfortunately, IUL insurance also has more than its fair share of disadvantages. Here are a few to be aware of.
As a person grows older, the odds of dying increase. For that reason, insurance companies raise the cost of IUL insurance premiums by as much as 8% to 10% annually after the age of 50.
From the moment a policyholder pays their first premium, fees nibble away at any profits they may gain. To understand how, it helps to understand how a premium load works. According to the International Risk Management Institute, Inc., a premium load is the percentage of a policyholder's premium that is deducted to cover policy expenses.
According to LIMRA -- the not-for-profit research association for the financial services industry -- sales of IULs are predicted to be up 11% in 2021. While there could be many reasons for the increase, one reason may be the tremendous fees collected by the insurance industry each time an IUL policy is sold and maintained.
Imagine someone purchases an IUL policy in their 30s or 40s, hoping it will help fund their retirement one day. In their 50s, they lose their job and can't pay the premium. They contact their insurance company and are happy to learn that their premiums can be paid from the cash accumulated in their account. The following year, they become ill and are never able to return to work full-time. The policy lapses, and the policyholder is not only without death benefit protection, but they lose everything they have paid into the policy.
Learn more: What Is Whole Life Insurance?
Committing to a permanent life insurance policy of any kind is rarely the best financial move.
Most financial experts advise against high-cost whole life insurance and recommend that individuals purchase low-cost term life insurance and invest the savings.
Life insurance is certainly not a one-size-fits-all subject, though. Take a deeper dive into the types of policies available. For example, compare whole vs. term life insurance. We've mentioned that whole life is rarely recommended by financial experts, but that doesn't mean it won't work for some. For example, a person who is concerned about estate planning and needs another place to leave tax-free funds for their beneficiaries may prefer a whole life policy.
Another thing insurance shoppers should consider is whether they're comfortable with premiums that increase with age. For example, the premiums on universal life insurance products -- like guaranteed universal, variable universal, and indexed universal -- all increase as the policyholder gets older. If that's a game-changer, it may be a better idea to check into life insurance with premiums that remain the same throughout the life of the policy.
Shopping for life insurance may be one of the least exciting products a person ever shops for. But by taking the time necessary to understand the different options, a person is more likely to end up with the kind of policy that offers a little peace of mind.
An IUL is only a good investment if the stock market tanks and your cash value grows faster than the market as a whole. When the stock market is flourishing, an IUL is likely to be a disappointment.
Yes, you can lose money if fees eat away at the small amount of guaranteed growth you are promised (which could be something like 3.5%). At the very least, the growth you are promised may fail to keep up with inflation.
Typically, no. IUL insurance is not a good investment due to the low guaranteed growth rate and sky-high fees charged for managing your policy.
Withdrawals up to the amount you contributed to the account are tax free. Any funds withdrawn beyond that are added to taxable income for the year.

Indexed universal life (IUL) insurance is a type of permanent life insurance, meaning it has a cash value component along with a death benefit. The money in a policyholder's cash value account can earn interest by tracking a stock market index selected by the insurer, such as the Nasdaq-100 or the Standard & Poor's 500.1 You may also have a fixed-rate account and can choose how much you want to go into each account.
As with universal life insurance, IUL policies have adjustable premiums. You can underpay or skip premiums, and you may be able to adjust your death benefit as well. What makes IUL different is the way the cash value is invested.
When you take out an indexed universal life insurance policy, the insurance company will help you select the index to use for all or part of the cash value account segment of your policy and your death benefit. When a premium is paid on the account, a portion pays the cost of insurance based on the insured's life. Any fees are paid, and the rest is added to the cash value.
The total cash value is credited with interest based on increases in an equity index (but isn't directly invested in the stock market). If you own an indexed universal life policy, you can likely borrow against the cash value accumulated in the policy. However, if you don't pay back your loans, they are deducted from the death benefit.
Some policies may allow the policyholder to select multiple indexes.
Policyholders can decide the percentage allocated to the fixed and indexed accounts. The selected index value is recorded at the beginning of the month and compared with the value at the end of the month. If the index increases during the month, the interest is added to the cash value. The index gains are credited back to the policy, either on a monthly or an annual basis.
IULs usually offer a guaranteed minimum fixed interest rate and a choice of benchmark equity indexes to track.
People who need permanent life insurance protection but wish to take advantage of possible cash accumulation via an equity index might use IULs as key person insurance for business owners, premium-financing plans, or estate-planning vehicles.
Let's say your selected index for your IUL policy gained 6% from the beginning of June to the end of June. The 6% is multiplied by the cash value. The resulting interest is added to the cash value. Some policies calculate the index gains as the sum of the changes for the period, while other policies take an average of the daily gains for a month. No interest is credited to the cash account if the index goes down instead of up.
The gains from the index are credited to the policy based on a percentage rate, referred to as the “participation rate.”5 The rate is set by the insurance company and can be anywhere from 25% to more than 100%. For example, if the gain is 6%, the participation rate is 50%, and the current cash value total is $10,000, $300 is added to the cash value (6% x 50% x $10,000 = $300).
IUL insurance policies are less risky than variable life insurance because no cash is directly invested in the stock market.
While not for everyone, IUL insurance policies are a viable option for people seeking permanent life insurance with a cash component that earns interest plus a death benefit. This type of life insurance is more expensive than term life insurance, but you get permanent coverage and the death benefit paid tax-free to your beneficiaries when you die.6 The policy may even increase in value due to the cash value component, and you may be able to borrow from your account.
An IUL can be a good way to save up money in a cash value account that, connected to a market index, may earn modest returns, but it is first and foremost a life insurance policy, not an investment vehicle.
It is unlikely you will lose money in an IUL because insurance providers set a guarantee for your principal to protect it against losses in the market. However, there also is often a cap on the maximum amount you can earn.
For most people, no, IUL isn't better than a 401(k) in terms of saving for retirement. Most IULs are best for high-net-worth individuals looking for ways to reduce their taxable income. A 401(k) is a better investment vehicle because it doesn't carry the high fees and premiums of an IUL, plus there is no cap on the amount you may earn, unlike with an IUL policy.
Indexed universal life policies cap how much money you can accumulate, often at less than 100%, and they are based on an possibly volatile equity index. While you may not lose any money in the account if the index goes down, you won't earn interest. If the market turns bullish, the earnings on your IUL will not be as high as a typical investment account. The high cost of premiums and fees makes IULs expensive and considerably less affordable than term life.
Not necessarily. IUL insurance policies have an investment element, which can grow and earn interest connected to an equity index. They also have flexible premiums.
Whole life insurance is a more straightforward form of permanent life insurance, with a guaranteed death benefit, fixed premiums, and cash value component that acts like a savings vehicle, rather than an investment account. Whole life is easier to understand but may not provide the upside that IUL can.
Indexed universal life (IUL) insurance is a form of permanent life insurance that offers a cash value component along with a death benefit. The money in the cash value account can earn interest through tracking an equity index selected by the insurer, and can also usually be partially allocated to a fixed-rate account. However, Indexed universal life policies cap how much money you can accumulate, often at less than 100%, and they are based on a possibly volatile equity index.
Beyond the death benefit offered by an IUL policy, these shouldn't be considered optimum retirement savings vehicles. A 401(k) is a better option for that purpose because it doesn't carry the high fees and premiums of an IUL policy, plus there is no cap on the amount you may earn when invested. Most IUL policies are best for high-net-worth individuals seeking to lower their taxable income.

0.309278350515464,"Growth stocks are those of companies that are considered to have the potential to outperform the overall market over time because of their future potential. Value stocks are classified as companies that are currently trading below what they are really worth and will thus provide a superior return. Which category is better? The comparative historical performance of these two sub-sectors yields some surprising results.
Value stocks are usually larger, more well-established companies that trade below the price that analysts feel the stock is worth, depending upon the financial ratio or benchmark used as a comparison. For example, the book value of a company’s stock may be $25 a share based on the number of shares outstanding divided by the company’s capitalization. Therefore, if it trades for $20 a share at the moment, then many analysts would consider this to be a good value play.
Stocks can become undervalued for many reasons. In some cases, public perception will push the price down, such as if a major figure in the company is caught in a personal scandal or the company does something unethical. But if the company’s financials are still relatively solid, then value-seekers may see this as an ideal entry point, because they figure that the public will soon forget about whatever happened and the price will rise to where it should be.
Analysts consider growth stocks to have the potential to outperform either the overall markets or a specific subsegment of them for a period of time. These stocks can be found in small-, mid-, and large-cap sectors and can only retain this status until analysts feel that they have achieved their potential.
Growth companies are considered to have a good chance for considerable expansion over the next few years, either because they have a product or line of products that are expected to sell well or because they appear to be run better than many of their competitors and are thus predicted to gain an edge on them in their market.
Make sure you choose the right investment strategy and stocks that align with your objectives and investment goals.
The table below highlights some of the key differences that exist between value and growth stocks.
When it comes to comparing the historical performances of the two respective sub-sectors of stocks, any results that can be seen must be evaluated in terms of time horizon and the amount of volatility and, thus, any risk that was endured to achieve them.
Value stocks are at least theoretically considered to have a lower level of risk and volatility associated with them because they are usually found among larger, more established companies. And even if they don’t return to the target price that analysts or investors predict, they may still offer some capital growth. One other thing to keep in mind is that these stocks also often pay dividends as well.
Growth stocks, meanwhile, usually refrain from paying out dividends. Instead, they reinvest retained earnings back into the company to expand. The probability of loss for investors with growth stocks can also be greater, particularly if the company can't keep up with growth expectations.
For example, a company with a highly touted new product may indeed see its stock price plummet if the product is a dud or if it has some design flaws that keep it from working properly. Growth stocks, in general, possess the highest potential reward, as well as risk, for investors.
Although the passage above suggests that growth stocks would post the best numbers over longer periods, the opposite has actually been true.
Consult a financial professional if you're unsure about what stocks may work well for you and your goals.
An example of a value stock would be a bank, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM). While key growth is often found in the technology space, such as Google (GOOG).
The decision to invest in growth vs. value stocks is ultimately left to an individual investor’s preference, as well as their personal risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. It should be noted that over shorter periods, the performance of either growth or value will also depend in large part upon the point in the cycle that the market happens to be in.
For example, value stocks tend to outperform during bear markets and economic recessions, while growth stocks tend to excel during bull markets or periods of economic expansion. This factor should, therefore, be taken into account by shorter-term investors or those seeking to time the markets.

when you open and fund an account with Webull.
The main difference between growth and value stocks is that value stocks are companies investors think are undervalued by the market, and growth stocks are companies that investors think will deliver better-than-average returns. There are also growth mutual funds and value mutual funds, which hold growth and value stocks respectively.
Before you opt for a stock or mutual fund of the growth or value variety, here’s what you need to know about each school of thought, starting with a comparison of the major differences.
Low dividend yields (or no dividend).
May not appreciate as much as expected.
Value investors are on the hunt for hidden gems in the market: stocks with low prices but promising prospects. The reasons these stocks may be undervalued can vary widely, including a short-term event like a public relations crisis or a longer-term phenomenon like depressed conditions within the industry.
Such investors buy stocks they believe are underpriced, either within a specific industry or the market more broadly, betting the price will rebound once others catch on. Generally speaking, these stocks have low price-to-earnings ratios (a metric for valuing a company) and high dividend yields (the ratio a company pays in dividends relative to its share price). The risk? The price may not appreciate as expected.
Benjamin Graham is known as the father of value investing, and his 1949 book “The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing” is still popular today. One of Graham’s disciples is the most famous contemporary investor: Warren Buffett.
Growth investors often chase the market’s high fliers. You’ve likely seen the disclaimer from financial companies that past performance isn’t indicative of future results. Well, this investing style is seemingly at odds with that idea.
It’s essentially doubling down: Investors bet a stock that’s already demonstrated better-than-average growth (be it earnings, revenue or some other metric) will continue to do so, making it attractive for investment. These companies typically are leaders in their respective industries; their stocks have above-average price-to-earnings ratios and may pay low (or no) dividends. But by buying at an already-high price, the risk is that something unforeseen could cause the stock’s price to fall.
This style’s “father,” Thomas Rowe Price Jr., developed his philosophy in the 1930s and later went on to found the asset management firm that still bears his name: T. Rowe Price.
Each school has devoted followers, but there’s a lot of overlap. Depending on the criteria used for selection, you’ll see stocks that are included in both value and growth mutual funds. What gives?
In part, it’s much ado about a distinction that’s not set in stone. For example, a stock can evolve over its lifetime from value to growth, or vice versa.
It’s also worth noting that investors in the value versus growth debate have the same goal (buy low and sell high); they’re just going about it in different ways.
Value investors look for companies that have already earned their stripes and have a stock price that’s lower than it should be (and may rise again to reflect that). Growth investors look for companies with future potential and expect the stock price to increase (even if it’s already relatively high) as the companies reach or exceed that potential. Same desired destination, different ways of getting there.
The stock market goes through cycles of varying length that favor either growth or value strategies. The stocks in the Russell 1000 Growth index outperformed those in the Russell 1000 Value index during the 2009-2020 bull market, but that’s not always the case on a year-by-year basis.
What’s an investor to do? One option is to invest in both strategies equally. Together, they add diversity to the equity side of a portfolio, offering potential for returns when either style is in favor.
Because the market goes in value-growth cycles, think about your investing strategy, and consider rebalancing periodically so your portfolio stays in your preferred allocation.
In addition to the myth that investors must be growth or value purists, it’s also important to realize these styles often whittle down to industry. Many growth stocks tend to be in tech or IT; value stocks are frequently in the financial sector. This breakdown makes sense: The country’s major financial institutions are far more established than the relatively new leaders in information technology.
Finally, understand that effective diversification matters more. Some investors who piece together a portfolio by stock picking might stumble upon growth and value unintentionally.
Bought stock in a large, 100-year-old company during a market dip? That may have been a value investing move. Jumped on a pricey, hot stock that’s been soaring in recent years? You just became a growth investor. But either way, you’re buying into the stock market, betting you’ll be able to sell those shares at a higher price at a later date.

0.305555555555556,"Many of these metals and materials are crucial to the global economy. Industries need the raw materials to build and manufacture goods, products, and infrastructure. When the economy is expanding, mined materials are in high demand, which boosts prices.
However, the mining industry is cyclical. Demand for mined materials tends to fall when the economy slows down. Mining stock prices typically decline during a recession. That’s a concern for investors in 2022 given the worries that surging inflation will force central banks to raise interest rates, which could tip the global economy into a recession.
One factor causing inflation is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Both countries play a major role in the iron and steel industries and are significant fertilizer producers. If the war continues, it could keep the upward pressure on those commodity prices.
Given the mining industry’s cyclicality, investors need to focus their attention on mining stocks that can weather future economic storms. Let's dig into some of 2022’s best mining stocks and take a closer look at investing in the mining industry.
Here's a closer look at these top mining companies.
Barrick Gold is one of the largest gold miners in the world, with operations in more than a dozen countries. It's also a leading copper producer.
Tier One mines produce a relatively steady supply of low-cost gold and copper, enabling Barrick to continue making money when prices are low.
Barrick Gold’s Tier One mines can generate lots of cash, allowing it to pay an attractive base dividend payment that it complements with a quarterly performance dividend payment that fluctuates with its cash balance.
BHP Group is a diversified resources company. It operates fully integrated mining assets that extract and process copper, iron ore, coal, nickel, zinc, and potash. Its mining assets span the globe. BHP Group also had an oil and natural gas business but merged those assets with Woodside Petroleum (WDS  -0.19%) in a deal that closed in 2022. The merger transformed BHP into a pure-play mining company.
Although BHP Group produces several commodities, it primarily aims to be a low-cost producer. It efficiently operates large resource-rich mines and uses technology such as autonomous vehicles to reduce costs. The mining company's focus on minimizing expenses also helps to mute the impact of inflation.
BHP Group combines its low-cost operations with a strong balance sheet, which it strengthens by routinely selling its least-profitable mines and non-core assets.
The mining company is well-positioned to invest in high-return expansion projects even when commodity prices are low. Its production volumes are relatively stable. Although there’s some variability to its cash flow, BHP’s low costs enable it to generate free cash flow to reliably pay dividends and repurchase stock.
Like Barrick, BHP Group’s dividend has some variability. The company pays out at least 50% of its profits each reporting period in dividends, so its dividend outlay will rise or fall with its cash flow.
If you're using the wrong credit or debit card, it could be costing you serious money.

Rio Tinto is a diversified mining company. It's a leading producer of the three most-consumed industrial metals -- iron ore, aluminum, and copper. Rio Tinto also mines a variety of other metals and minerals, including boron, salt, diamonds, and titanium.
Like BHP Group, Rio Tinto aims to be a low-cost producer of metals and minerals. It's able to keep costs down by operating mining assets that are integrated and big. Rio Tinto's investments in new technologies, such as autonomous vehicles and renewable energy, reduce costs and increase productivity.
Rio Tinto has proven its ability to make money even during weak market conditions. It has a strong balance sheet and routinely sells non-core mines to reallocate cash to better opportunities. For example, in recent years, it has exited the coal mining business due to the sector’s dwindling prospects amid climate change concerns. Meanwhile, in 2022, it offered to buy the outstanding shares of copper miner Turquoise Hill Resources (NYSE:TRQ) that it doesn’t already own. The deal would simplify its ownership of the massive Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia, making it easier to develop its extensive copper resources.
The company regularly expands its best mines and aggressively repays debt. Rio Tinto is another mining company that pays dividends to shareholders and repurchases its own shares throughout the economic cycle. It tries to pay 40% to 60% of its cash flow in dividends, with payments varying each period depending on its earnings.
The mining industry is rapidly changing in the current economic climate. Check out the latest articles in the feed below.
A closer look at this subgroup of the basic materials sector and some of the best metals stocks to invest in.
These companies make the building blocks of everything we use and consume.
This safe-haven metal can be a precious investment.
This precious metal is widely used in industrial applications.
The mining industry is cyclical and capital-intensive. Mining companies have more money to invest in new mines and expansion projects during periods of economic expansion. However, the long lead times required to complete projects often cause problems for mining companies. Projects developed during boom times frequently don’t come online until after the cycle changes, which affects returns.
Investors in mining stocks should also pay close attention to the amount of debt carried by a mining company. Companies with high amounts of debt often struggle during economic downturns, while companies with low production costs are the most profitable and least likely to heavily rely on debt to fund growth.
Given these challenges, investors should focus on the top mining companies. They have proven their ability to generate profit regardless of economic conditions. If you are comfortable with some volatility and if receiving dividends is a priority for you, then adding some high-quality mining stocks to your portfolio might be the right move.
Investors in mining stocks should be keenly aware of both the mining industry's cyclicality and its capital-intensive nature. The best mining companies have proven abilities to generate profit regardless of economic conditions. If you are comfortable with some volatility, and, if receiving dividends is a priority for you, then adding some high-quality mining stocks to your portfolio might be the right move.
There are many benefits to buying gold stocks instead of the physical metal. Gold companies can likely generate higher total returns than simply an investment in physical gold because, when the price of gold rises, these companies can expand their operations and their profits. This growth should enable their stocks to outperform the price of gold. But not all gold stocks outperform the price appreciation of the precious metal, which means that investors need to choose their gold stocks carefully.

These are the mining stocks with the lowest 12-month trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Because profits can be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, a low P/E ratio shows that you’re paying less for each dollar of profit generated.
These are the top mining stocks as ranked by a growth model that scores companies based on a 50/50 weighting of their most recent quarterly year-over-year (YOY) percentage revenue growth and most recent quarterly YOY earnings-per-share (EPS) growth.
Both sales and earnings are critical factors in the success of a company. Therefore, ranking companies by only one growth metric makes a ranking susceptible to the accounting anomalies of that quarter (such as changes in tax law or restructuring costs) that may make one figure or the other unrepresentative of the business in general. Companies with quarterly EPS or revenue growth of more than 1,000% were excluded as outliers.
These are the mining stocks that had the highest total return over the last 12 months.

There was a time years ago when the only people able to trade actively in the stock market were those working for large financial institutions, brokerages, and trading houses. The arrival of online trading, along with instantaneous dissemination of news, have leveled the playing—or should we say trading—field. The easy-to-use trading apps and 0% commissions of services like Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, and Charles Schwab have made it easier than ever for retail investors to attempt to trade like the pros.
Day trading can turn into a lucrative career (as long as you do it properly). But it can be challenging for novices—especially those who don't have a well-planned strategy. And be aware that even the most seasoned day traders can hit rough patches and experience losses.
So, what exactly is day trading, and how does it work?
Day trading is a fast-paced form of trading where individuals buy and sell securities within the same trading day. The primary goal is to profit from short-term price movements in stocks, options, futures, and other financial instruments. Day traders typically use a combination of strategies and analysis, including technical analysis, which focuses on past price movements and trading patterns, and momentum; which involves capitalizing on short-term trends and reversals. Unlike long-term investors, day traders are less concerned with the fundamental value of the securities and more focused on capturing immediate gains from market fluctuations.The appeal of day trading lies in its potential for quick gains, but it's also associated with significant risks. It requires a solid understanding of the markets and the ability to make fast, informed decisions. Day traders need to stay abreast of market headlines, economic reports, and other factors that can influence stock prices throughout the day. They often employ leverage, borrowing money which can increase both potential profits and potential losses. As such, day trading is generally not recommended for inexperienced traders or those without the financial capacity to absorb losses.The regulatory environment around day trading is also important to understand. In the United States, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) set rules for ""pattern day traders,"" defined as those who execute four or more day trades within five business days. These traders must maintain a minimum cash balance of $25,000 in their brokerage account.1 Such regulations are designed to ensure that only those with sufficient resources and understanding participate in this high-stakes activity.
Day trading is most common;y observed in the stock markets and on the foreign exchange (forex) where currencies are traded.
Day traders are attuned to events that cause short-term market moves. Trading based on the news is one popular technique. Scheduled announcements such as the release of economic statistics, corporate earnings, or interest rate announcements are subject to market expectations and market psychology. That is, markets react when those expectations are not met or are exceeded—usually with sudden, significant moves which can greatly benefit day traders.
A trader needs to have an edge over the rest of the market. Day traders use any of a number of strategies, including swing trading, arbitrage, and trading news. They refine these strategies until they produce consistent profits and limit their losses.
There also are some basic rules of day trading that are wise to follow: Pick your trading choices wisely. Plan your entry and exit points in advance and stick to the plan. Identify patterns in the trading activities of your choices in advance.
The profit potential of day trading is an oft-debated topic on Wall Street. Internet day-trading scams have lured amateurs by promising enormous returns in a short period of time.
Some people day-trade without sufficient knowledge. But there are day traders who make a successful living despite—or perhaps because of—the risks.
Many professional money managers and financial advisors shy away from day trading. They argue that, in most cases, the reward does not justify the risk. Moreover, many economists and financial practitioners argue that active trading strategies of any kind tend to underperform a more basic passive index strategy over time especially after fees and taxes are taken into account.
Profiting from day trading is possible, but the success rate is inherently lower because it is risky and requires considerable skill. And don’t underestimate the role that luck and good timing play. A stroke of bad luck can sink even the most experienced day trader.
Professional day traders—those who trade for a living rather than as a hobby—are typically well established in the field.3 They usually have in-depth knowledge of the marketplace, too. Here are some of the prerequisites required to be a successful day trader.
Individuals who attempt to day-trade without an understanding of market fundamentals often lose money. A working knowledge of technical analysis and chart reading is a good start. But without a deep understanding of the market and its unique risks, charts can be deceiving.
Do your due diligence and understand the particular ins and outs of the products you trade.
Wise day traders use only risk capital that they can afford to lose. This protects them from financial ruin and helps eliminate emotion from their trading decisions.
A large amount of capital is often necessary to capitalize effectively on intraday price movements, which can be in pennies or fractions of a cent.
Adequate cash is required for day traders who intend to use leverage in margin accounts. Volatile market swings can trigger big margin calls on short notice.
Many day traders end up losing money because they fail to make trades that meet their own criteria. As the saying goes, “Plan the trade and trade the plan.” Success is impossible without discipline.
To profit, day traders rely heavily on market volatility. A day trader may find a stock attractive if it moves a lot during the day. That could happen for a number of different reasons, including an earnings report, investor sentiment, or even general economic or company news.
Day traders also like stocks that are highly liquid because that gives them the chance to change their position without altering the price of the stock. If a stock price moves higher, traders may take a buy position. If the price moves down, a trader may decide to sell short so they can profit when it falls.
Regardless of what technique a day trader uses, they’re usually looking to trade a stock that moves (a lot).
There are two primary divisions of professional day traders: those who work alone, and/or those who work for a larger institution.
Most day traders who trade for a living work for large players like hedge funds and the proprietary trading desks of banks and financial institutions. These traders have an advantage because they have access to resources such as direct lines to counterparties, a trading desk, large amounts of capital and leverage, and expensive analytical software.
These traders are typically looking for easy profits from arbitrage opportunities and news events. Their resources allow them to capitalize on these less risky day trades before individual traders can react.
Individual traders often manage other people’s money or simply trade with their own. Few have access to a trading desk, but they often have strong ties to a brokerage due to the large amounts they spend on commissions and access to other resources.
This is usually reserved for traders who work for larger institutions or those who manage large amounts of money.
The trading or dealing desk provides these traders with instantaneous order execution, which is crucial. For example, when an acquisition is announced, day traders looking at merger arbitrage can place their orders before the rest of the market is able to take advantage of the price differential.
News provides most of the opportunities. It is imperative to be the first to know when something significant happens.
The typical trading room has access to all of the leading newswires, constant coverage from news organizations, and software that constantly scans news sources for important stories.
Combined, these tools provide traders with an edge over the rest of the marketplace.
If you follow these simple guidelines, you may be headed for a sustainable career in day trading.
A day trade is exactly the same as any stock trade except that both the purchase of a stock and its sale occur within the same day, and sometimes within seconds of each other.
For example, say a day trader has completed a technical analysis of a company called Intuitive Sciences Inc. (ISI). The analysis indicates that this stock, which is listed in the Nasdaq 100, shows a pattern of rising in price by at least 0.6% on most of the days when the NASDAQ is up more than 0.4%. The trader has reason to believe that this is going to be one of those days.
The trader buys 1,000 shares of ISI when the market opens, then waits until ISI reaches a particular price point, probably up 0.6%. The trader then immediately sells the entire holding in ISI.
This is a day trade. Obviously, the merits of ISI as an investment have nothing to do with the day trader's actions. A trend is being exploited.
What if ISI had bucked the trend and lost 0.8%? The trader will sell anyway and take the loss.
Day trading can be profitable, but it's far from guaranteed. Many day traders end up losing money before calling it quits. Success in day trading requires a deep understanding of market dynamics, the ability to analyze and act on market data quickly, and strict discipline in risk management. The profitability of day trading depends on several factors, including the trader's skill, strategy, and the amount of capital they can invest. While some traders do achieve significant profits, it's important to note that the high-risk nature of day trading also means it's possible to incur substantial losses. Additionally, profitability can be affected by transaction costs, taxes, and the psychological pressure associated with this type of trading.
The percentage of day traders who achieve profitability is relatively low. Various studies and broker reports suggest that a small fraction of day traders consistently make profits over the long term. Estimates vary, but it's commonly accepted that only around 10% to 15% of day traders are successful over time.89 This low success rate is attributed to the high risks, the need for substantial skill and experience, and the intense competition in the financial markets. Many aspiring day traders face significant losses in their early trading career, and only a few persist and learn the skills necessary to become profitable. This statistic underscores the importance of proper training, risk management, and realistic expectations when entering the world of day trading.
Day trading is challenging due to its fast-paced nature and the complexity of the financial markets. It requires traders to make quick decisions based on real-time information, which can be overwhelming, especially in volatile market conditions. Traders must be adept at technical analysis, interpreting charts and patterns, and understanding how economic events influence market movements. Moreover, emotional control is crucial; day traders must avoid common pitfalls like overtrading or letting emotions drive their decisions. The steep learning curve, combined with the need for discipline, consistent strategy, and the ability to handle losses, makes day trading a hard thing to succeed at.
The so-called first rule of day trading is never to hold onto a position when the market closes for the day. Win or lose, sell out.
Most day traders make it a rule never to hold a losing position overnight in the hope that part or all of the losses can be recouped.
For one thing, brokers have higher margin requirements for overnight trades, and that means additional capital is required.
There's a good reason for that. A stock can go down or up on overnight news, inflicting a bigger trading loss on the owners of shares.
Buying power refers to the total funds that an investor has available to trade securities, and it equals cash held in the account plus the available margin.
According to FINRA rules, a broker-dealer client who is designated as a pattern day trader may trade up to four times their maintenance margin excess as of the previous day’s market close.
Day traders can earn big profits or pile up significant losses. Indeed, with the evidence showing that most day traders lose money over time, it's an extremely risky career choice. Day traders, both institutional and individual, would argue that they play an essential role in the marketplace by keeping the markets efficient and liquid. Though day trading will always be intriguing to individual investors, anyone considering it needs to acquire the knowledge, the resources, and the cash that it takes to have a chance at succeeding.

The goal of day trading is to earn a lot of small profits from the short-term movements of stocks and other assets by buying and selling quickly.
Day trading is not without risks — experienced day traders use an array of strategies and practices to make informed trading decisions and control risk.
Novice day traders may consider starting small, keeping their day jobs and only using money they can afford to lose, along with learning popular day trading strategies such as range trading, spread trading, fading and momentum trading.
Day trading means buying and selling securities rapidly — often in less than a day — in an attempt to profit off of short-term price movements.
If you're researching how to day trade, chances are you're intrigued by the prospect of turning quick profits in the stock market. Make no mistake: you're facing long odds and steep risks.
But even if you're just dabbling in the market with a few extra dollars, it's important to understand the basics so you don't get in over your head.
Establish your strategy before you start. Losing money scares people into making bad decisions, and you have to lose money sometimes when you day trade. Having an exit plan for each of your investment holdings is important because it helps you avoid making an emotional decision when you need to make a rational decision.
Be patient. Look for trading opportunities that meet your strategic criteria. If the situation doesn’t meet it, don’t trade. You don’t have to trade if nothing looks attractive.
Read, read, read. Continually watch what’s happening in the markets. Big news — even unrelated to your investments — could change the whole tenor of the market, moving your positions without any company-specific news.

If you’re not quite ready to be a prime-time player, you can always try paper trading with a stock market simulator first. Paper trading involves fake stock trades, which let you see how the market works before risking real money. Paper trading accounts are available at many brokerages. You can also get a feel for the broker’s platform and functionality with this approach, in addition to seeing how theoretically profitable you'd be.
You'll need to determine the best trading strategy for you. You may wish to specialize in a specific strategy or mix and match from among some of the following typical strategies.
Traders find a stock that tends to bounce around between a low and a high price, called a ""range bound"" stock, and they buy when it nears the low and sell when it nears the high. They may also sell short when the stock reaches the high point, trying to profit as the stock falls to the low and then close out the short position.
This high-speed technique tries to profit on temporary changes in sentiment, exploiting the difference in the bid-ask price for a stock, also called a spread. For example, if a buyer’s bid price drops suddenly, the day trader might step in to buy and then try to quickly resell at the stock’s ask price or higher, earning a small “spread” on the transaction.
This sees a trader short-selling a stock that has gone up too quickly when buying interest starts to wane. The trader might close the short position when the stock falls or when buying interest picks up.
This strategy tries to ride the wave of a stock that’s moving, either up or down, perhaps to due to an earnings report or some other news. Traders will buy a rising stock or “fade” a falling one, anticipating that the momentum will continue.
How you execute these strategies is up to you. Some traders might angle for a penny per share, like spread traders, while others need to see a larger profit before closing a position, like swing traders. Some traders might be willing to hold overnight, while others won’t and prefer to maintain a neutral position in case bad news hits before they can react.
To know when to trade, day traders closely watch a stock’s order flow, the list of potential orders lining up to buy and sell a stock. Before buying, they’ll look for a stock to fall to “support,” a stock price at which other buyers step in to buy, and the stock is more likely to rise. To sell, they’ll look for when the stock hits “resistance,” a price where more traders start selling and the price is more likely to fall. To make judgments like this, you’ll want a broker that lets you see order flow.
Whichever strategy you pick, it's important to find one (or more) that work and that you have the confidence to use. It can take a while to find a strategy that works for you, and even then the market may change, forcing you to change your approach.
Stocks are among the most popular securities for day traders —  the market is big and active, and commissions are relatively low or nonexistent. You can also day trade bonds, options, futures, commodities and currencies.
Good volume. Day traders like stocks because they’re liquid, meaning they trade often and in high volume. Liquidity allows a trader to buy and sell without affecting the price much. Currency markets are also highly liquid.
Some volatility — but not too much. Volatility means the security's price changes frequently. This kind of movement is necessary for a day trader to make any profit. Someone has to be willing to pay a different price after you take a position.
Newsworthiness. Media coverage gets people interested in buying or selling a security. That helps create volatility and liquidity. Many day traders follow the news to find ideas on which they can act.
Day traders who focus on stocks often rely on “technical analysis,” or analyzing the movements of stocks on a chart, rather than “fundamental analysis,” which involves examining company factors such as its products, industry and management. While some day traders might exchange dozens of different securities in a day, others stick to just a few — and get to know those well. This knowledge helps you gauge when to buy and sell, how a stock has traded in the past and how it might trade in the future.
Day traders need liquidity and volatility, and the stock market offers those most frequently in the hours after it opens, from 9:30 a.m. to about noon ET, and then in the last hour of trading before the close at 4 p.m. ET.
As to the best time to trade for profitability, theories abound, but what can’t be disputed is the concentration of trades that bookend the regular market session. An analysis from the Jefferies Group showed that in 2018, 25% of average daily trading volume took place in the last 30 minutes of regular trading hours, excluding the closing auction, while 5.5% took place in the first 30 minutes.
A day trader might make 100 to a few hundred trades in a day, depending on the strategy and how frequently attractive opportunities appear. With so many trades, it’s important that day traders keep costs low — our online broker comparison tool can help narrow the options.
Position sizing. If the trade goes wrong, how much will you lose?
Percentage of your portfolio. Closely related to position sizing, how much will your overall portfolio suffer if a position goes bad?
Losses. What level of losses are you willing to endure before you sell?
Selling. After making a profitable trade, at what point do you sell?
Even with a good strategy and the right securities, trades will not always go your way. It’s important to have a plan for when to close a position, whether it's purely mechanical — for example, sell after it goes up or down X% — or based on how the stock or market is trading that day.
Proper risk management prevents small losses from turning into large ones and preserves capital for future trades. But that means traders have to be willing to realize a loss, which is hard for many traders to accept, even though it’s essential to long-term survival.
Day trading is just one way to approach the stock market — and it’s hardly worthwhile for most investors.
Conversely, investors who buy and hold low-cost index funds that track a broad market index like the S&P 500 could see higher returns over a long period. Historically, the S&P 500 has an annualized total return of about 10%, not accounting for inflation.
If you're going to day trade, It's paramount to set aside a certain amount of money you can afford to lose. Don’t trade more than that amount or use the mortgage or rent money.

If you execute four or more day trades — that is, trades in which you buy and sell a security the same day — within a five-business-day period, and those trades represent more than 6% of your total trades in that period, you'll be designated as a pattern day trader.
That means you'll have to maintain a minimum equity level of $25,000 in your margin account any time you day trade. That $25,000 can consist of cash, securities or both. You also may have your buying power restricted.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says that day traders ""typically suffer severe financial losses in their first months of trading, and many never graduate to profit-making status.[1]Securities and Exchange Commission. Day Trading: Your Dollars at Risk. Accessed Jan 3, 2024.View all sources""
That doesn't mean day trading is inherently a bad thing — if you have leftover ""play money"" after paying your bills and meeting your savings goals, and you want to try your hand at day trading with the knowledge that you might lose that money, that's fine.
But the SEC explicitly says that day traders ""should never use money they will need for daily living expenses, retirement, take out a second mortgage, or use their student loan money for day trading.""

0.304347826086957,"The amount of debt you can consider ""reasonable"" will vary widely depending on a number of factors about your financial situation and the type of debt you have. You'll need to consider how you are using the debt and how you are able to pay it off, as well as the debt's impact on your overall credit.
Learn how to determine how much debt is too much and how much debt may be considered reasonable. Then, you can better analyze your own financial situation.
Debt can allow you to purchase useful assets that would otherwise be too costly. Taking on a mortgage to buy a home, for example, not only provides a family with a place to live but can, in the long term, prove to be a worthwhile investment.
This is not to say that you should constantly be taking on debt. A moderate amount of debt that helps your overall situation and is within your means to pay down may be considered a reasonable amount of debt.
Generally, what is considered a reasonable amount of debt depends on a variety of factors, such as what stage of life you are in, your spending and saving habits, the stability of your job, your career prospects, your financial obligations, and so on.
If you have an unmanageable amount of debt, you may want to consider using a debt relief company, which can help you negotiate with creditors to pay a lower amount. These companies work with unsecured debt in which you are significantly behind in payments.
So, if you earn $50,000 per year and follow the 28/36 rule, your housing expenses should not exceed $14,000 annually, or about $1,167 per month, and your housing expenses plus other debt service should not exceed $18,000. That means your non-housing debts should cost you no more than $4,000 annually or $333 per month.
Further assuming that you can get a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at an interest rate of 4% and that your monthly mortgage payments are a maximum of $900 (leaving $267, or $1,167 less $900, monthly toward insurance, property taxes, and other housing expenses), the maximum mortgage debt you can take on is about $188,500.
If you are in the fortunate position of having no credit card debt and no other liabilities and are also thinking about buying a new car to get around town, you can take on a car loan of about $17,500 (assuming an interest rate of 5% on the car loan, repayable over five years).
To summarize, at an income level of $50,000 annually, or $4,167 per month, a reasonable amount of debt would be anything below the maximum threshold of $188,500 in mortgage debt and an additional $17,500 in other personal debt (a car loan, in this instance).
Note that this example is based on early 2020s interest rates, which were at near-historic lows. Higher interest rates on mortgage debt and personal loans would reduce the amount of debt that can be serviced since interest costs would eat up a larger chunk of your available income.
The 28/36 rule is typically applied to gross income, as in the scenario above. Financial institutions also use gross income in calculating acceptable debt ratios, because net income or take-home pay can vary from one locale to the next, depending on state and local income taxes and other paycheck deductions.
But it can be safer to base your borrowing and spending habits on your take-home pay, since this is the amount that you actually have at your disposal after taxes and other deductions.
So, in the above example, assuming that income tax and other deductions reduce gross income by a total of 25%, you're left with $37,500 or $3,125 monthly. This means that if you follow the 28/36 rule, you could allocate $10,500 or $875 monthly to household-related costs and $250 to other debt, for a total of $1,125 per month or $13,500 annually.
Debt can be a financial benefit when it's managed properly and when it serves to help you build wealth. While your personal financial situation will ultimately dictate the amount of debt that's reasonable, the 28/36 rule provides a useful starting point to calculate a reasonable debt load. Consider consulting a financial professional to help you determine how debt can play a role in your finances.

Wondering if you have too much debt? Looking into your debt-to-income ratio can help answer your question. Add up your monthly debt obligations (things like auto loans, housing payments and credit card bills) and divide it by your monthly gross income. Debt loads in excess of 36% of your DTI can be difficult to pay off and can make accessing credit more challenging.
If you can't keep up with payments, or you're facing stress or sleepless nights, then it’s likely time to make a plan to pay off your debt or look into debt relief.
Use the calculator below to tease out whether your debt is problematic. The calculator will also offer recommendations for what to do next.
Enter various debts — such as credit card payments and medical bills — and your income into this calculator. Student loans and mortgages tend to be less problematic forms of debt, so set those aside for now.
If it's less than 36%, your debt load is within the range considered affordable compared with your earnings.
If it's between 36% to 42%, look into DIY methods like debt snowball or debt avalanche.
If it's between 43% to 50%, take action to reduce your debt load; consulting a nonprofit credit counseling agency may be helpful. If it's 50% or more, your debt load is high risk; consider getting advice from a bankruptcy attorney.
It's important to separate the good, the bad and the toxic. A mortgage with an annual percentage rate of 3.5%, for example, can be weighed differently than a credit card with a 20% APR.
When the interest rate is low and fixed, and the loan is used to buy something that grows in value, like a house, business or college education. It’s also good if the interest is tax-deductible, like most mortgage and student loan interest.
Loans with high or variable interest rates that are used to buy things that lose value or get used up. Examples include high-interest personal loans for discretionary purchases like vacations, auto loans stretching five years or longer, or high-interest credit card debt with increasing balances.
No-credit-check and payday loans with APRs above 36%, loans so long you end up paying more than the item is worth, or loans requiring collateral you can’t afford to lose, like your car.
Bad debt has crushing interest costs and limits your cash flow, savings and ability to borrow for goals like buying a home, says Erika Safran, a certified financial planner with Safran Wealth Advisors in New York City.
But a low-interest mortgage that you can comfortably afford shouldn’t keep you up at night.
Your debt balance is not going down despite regular payments.
You’re living paycheck to paycheck, with no money at the end of the month.
You’re not contributing to an employer-sponsored retirement plan because you need the money.
You’re unable to build an emergency fund of at least $500 to buffer against financial shocks.
You’re using credit cards for cash advances.
Guideline: When buying a home, limit your mortgage costs to 36% of your income or less. This calculator helps you see how much house you can afford.
How to handle an overload: Look into refinancing, or consider downsizing or moving to a lower-cost area. If you’re refinancing or changing homes in your 40s or 50s, choose a 15- or 20-year mortgage, so you can be mortgage-free by retirement.
Guideline: Don’t borrow more for a degree than you expect to make in your first year in the workforce. If you expect a starting salary of $40,000, for example, limit your loans to $10,000 per year for a four-year degree. Overborrowing is a common regret among student loan recipients, according to NerdWallet research.
How to handle an overload: Explore your repayment options, including income-driven repayment plans and refinancing.
Guideline: Experts say your total auto costs — including car payment — should stay within 20% of your take-home pay. Car loans should be for four years or fewer and ideally accompanied by a 20% down payment. That way you don’t spend years owing more than the car is worth.
How to handle an overload: If you have an unaffordable car loan, consider refinancing it or trading your car in for a less expensive one.
Guideline: Medical debt is a special case since health care expenses are often beyond consumers’ control. This type of debt is generally interest-free, but the amounts involved can make it unmanageable.
How to handle an overload: Try negotiating with the billing office to lower the amount due or set up an affordable payment plan. Take steps to cover the costs on your own if possible, but you may need to look into debt relief.

0.300884955752212,"Investing in stocks is one of the greatest ways to build long-term wealth available to ordinary Americans. Despite the long-term benefits, stock investing carries several risks that make it a bad idea to keep 100% of your money invested in stocks throughout your life. Not even Warren Buffett -- arguably the greatest stock investor of our time -- puts all his money into stocks.
That's where asset allocation comes into play. This investment strategy aims to balance risk with reward by allocating a portion of an investor's portfolio to less risky asset classes to offset the risk associated with more volatile assets such as common stocks.
This guide will help investors understand the importance of asset allocation and the factors that play the most crucial roles in determining the best mix of assets for each investor.
Asset allocation is an investing strategy that divides an investment portfolio among various asset classes. This process creates a diverse mix of assets designed to offset riskier assets with less risky ones. Asset allocation is often deeply personal since it depends largely on an investor's ability to tolerate risk and their investing time horizon.
Asset allocation is the primary driver of the volatility an investor encounters and the returns they earn. According to a Vanguard study, about 88% of an investor's experience is tied to asset allocation if they have a diversified portfolio, not to the specific stocks they own in that portfolio.
In other words, investors with the same asset allocation generally had consistent experiences, even if they held different investments. That's primarily due to the correlation between assets in the same class, meaning they typically move in the same direction. Given the importance of asset allocation, investors must find the right mix that aligns with their risk tolerance and investing time horizon.
As an example, let's take a look at two hypothetical investors. One is single, 25 years old, does not have kids, and has a stable career. The other is a married, recently retired 65-year-old.
The first investor has a long investing time horizon because they're decades away from retirement. The other has a shorter one since they're already there. The first hypothetical investor doesn't have a family yet but has a steady job, so they can afford to take more investment risks. But the other will likely want to play it safe.
Their asset allocations will likely be quite different. The first investor can afford to keep a larger portion of their portfolio in riskier assets. The recent retiree, however, will probably want a greater percentage of their portfolio in less risky investments since they have less time to make up for any bad ones.

There are three primary investment asset classes: equities, cash and cash equivalents, and fixed income.
Equities. Equities give an investor an equity interest or ownership claim in a business. Equity investments include common stock, preferred stock, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These equity investments could generate dividend income or be non-dividend payers, such as growth stocks.
Cash and equivalents. Cash and equivalents include cash, savings accounts, money market accounts, and bank CDs.
Fixed income. Fixed-income investments are debt and debt-like investments in a company or government entity or a loan to an individual. These investments include corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and Treasury bonds. They can also be mortgage loans, bridge loans, personal loans, and other debt-like instruments with a fixed-rate income payment.
Additional investable assets. There are also other types of investable assets. These include real estate, such as rental properties, farmland, and commercial properties; commodities like gold, futures, and other financial derivatives, such as options; and cryptocurrencies.
Portfolio diversification is one step investors take to reduce their risk of suffering a permanent loss or enduring extreme volatility. Asset allocation takes that a step further by introducing less risky assets with lower volatility, like fixed income.
As the table shows, a portfolio with 100% stocks delivered the highest average annual return compared to portfolios with some fixed-income allocation. It also produced the best overall year. However, this hypothetical portfolio also endured the most years with losses and the biggest one-year loss.
As investors increased their allocation to fixed income -- bonds, in this case -- they reduced their overall average annualized return. However, they also reduced risk, as shown by the lower loss in the worst year and fewer years with losses.
Higher allocations of bonds generated some bigger one-year returns compared to a more balanced portfolio. Meanwhile, a 100% bond allocation led to a greater number of years with losses than some of the more balanced portfolios.
Adding other asset classes to a portfolio can further reduce its overall volatility while improving returns. For example, a traditionally balanced portfolio (60% stocks and 40% bonds) produced a 6.1% average annual return over the 10-year period that ended in 2022 -- and that's after a huge 16% drop in 2022.
This 60/40 portfolio may not go up as much on average as a portfolio with a higher percentage of equities. But it tends to be less volatile than a portfolio comprised entirely of stocks.
Adding a 10% allocation to private real estate while dropping the stock and fixed-income allocations to 55% and 35%, respectively, could yield higher returns with less volatility than a standard 60/40 portfolio.
According to information published by private real estate investing company Accordant, a portfolio with a 10% allocation in private real estate returned 8.2% annually, on average, with 8.8% volatility during the decade leading up to the end of the first quarter of 2023. That's compared to annual returns of 7.9% and volatility of 9.8% for a portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% fixed income.
An investor's risk tolerance -- their ability and willingness to lose some or all of their investment in exchange for a higher return potential -- is an essential factor when determining asset allocation. Given that mixing in different asset classes reduces a portfolio's risk profile, investors with a lower risk tolerance (regardless of age) should consider allocating more to less risky assets, such as fixed income and cash.
They also might want to consider other asset classes with less correlation to the stock and bond markets, like real estate and commodities such as gold, to reduce their portfolio's risk profile further. Conversely, investors with higher risk tolerances should weigh their asset allocation more toward equities like common stocks.
Risk tolerance can be a state of mind, as some people are more risk-averse than others. Life stage or future planning also plays a role in determining risk tolerance levels.
A young investor might have an extremely low tolerance for losses, leading them to allocate more to less risky assets. On the other hand, a more risk-tolerant investor might choose to reduce their exposure to stocks and increase their allocations to bonds and cash if they had a recent life change (got married, lost their job, or had a baby).
Similarly, it makes sense for an investor to shift their allocation to less risky assets if they plan to use a portion of their investments to fund a large future expenditure, like a house, a new business, or travel.
Age is another factor investors should consider when setting their asset allocation strategy. For age-based asset allocation, younger investors should consider having a higher allocation to equities, while older investors nearing retirement should increase the fixed-income percentage of their portfolio.
An ESG portfolio has the potential to protect returns even during market downturns.
Asset allocation plays a vital role in an investor's overall experience since there's a lot of correlation among assets in the same class. However, there's no standardized asset allocation strategy for all investors.
Investors must personalize their asset allocation to ensure they have the right mix of asset classes for their risk tolerance and age. Doing so will improve their investing experience by reducing their portfolio's overall volatility while still producing acceptable returns.

Consider it the opposite of putting all your eggs in one basket. Allocating your investments among different asset classes is a key strategy to minimize your risk and potentially increase your gains.
Asset allocation means spreading your investments across various asset classes. Broadly speaking, that means a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash or money market securities.
This is the risk-return tradeoff. High-risk choices are better suited to investors who have higher risk tolerance. That is, they can accept wide swings in market prices. A younger investor with a long-term investment account can expect to recover in time. A couple nearing or in retirement may not want to jeopardize their accumulated wealth.
The rule of thumb is that an investor should gradually reduce risk exposure over the years in order to reach retirement with a reasonable amount of money stashed in safe investments.
Equities have the highest potential return but also the highest risk. Treasury bills have the lowest risk but provide the lowest return.
This is why diversification through asset allocation is important. Every investment comes with its own risks and market fluctuations. Asset allocation insulates your entire portfolio from the ups and downs of a single stock or class of securities.
So although part of your portfolio may contain more volatile securities that you've chosen based on their potential for higher returns, the other part of your portfolio is devoted to more stable assets.
Because each asset class has its own level of return and risk, investors should consider their risk tolerance, investment objectives, time horizon, and available money to invest as the basis for their asset composition. All of this is important as investors look to create their optimal portfolio.
Investors with a long time horizon and larger sums to invest may feel comfortable with high-risk, high-return options. Investors with smaller sums and shorter time spans may prefer low-risk, low-return allocations.
To make the asset allocation process easier for clients, many investment companies create a series of model portfolios, each comprised of different proportions of asset classes. Each portfolio satisfies a particular level of investor risk tolerance. In general, these model portfolios range from conservative to very aggressive.
Conservative model portfolios generally allocate a large percentage of the total to lower-risk securities such as fixed-income and money market securities.
The main goal of a conservative portfolio is to protect the principal value of your portfolio. That's why these models are often referred to as capital preservation portfolios.
Even if you are very conservative and are tempted to avoid the stock market entirely, some exposure to stocks can help offset inflation. You can invest the equity portion in high-quality blue-chip companies or an index fund.
A moderately conservative portfolio works for the investor who wishes to preserve most of the portfolio's total value but is willing to take on some risk for inflation protection. A common strategy within this risk level is called current income. With this strategy, you choose securities that pay a high level of dividends or coupon payments.
Moderately aggressive model portfolios are often referred to as balanced portfolios because the asset composition is divided almost equally between fixed-income securities and equities. The balance is between growth and income. Because moderately aggressive portfolios have a higher level of risk than conservative portfolios, this strategy is best for investors with a longer time horizon (generally more than five years) and a medium level of risk tolerance.
Aggressive portfolios mainly consist of equities, so their value can fluctuate widely from day to day. If you have an aggressive portfolio, your main goal is to achieve long-term growth of capital. The strategy of an aggressive portfolio is often called a capital growth strategy. To provide diversification, investors with aggressive portfolios usually add some fixed-income securities.
Very aggressive portfolios consist almost entirely of stocks. With a very aggressive portfolio, your goal is strong capital growth over a long time horizon.  Because these portfolios carry considerable risk, the value of the portfolio will vary widely in the short term.
These model portfolios and the strategies that go with them can offer only a loose guideline. You can modify the proportions to suit your own individual investment needs. How you fine-tune the models above depends on your future financial needs for capital and on the kind of investor you are.
For instance, if you like to research your own companies and devote time to stock picking, you will probably further divide the equities portion of your portfolio into subclasses of stocks. By doing so, you can achieve a specialized risk-return potential within one portion of your portfolio.
Also, the percentage of the portfolio that you devote to cash and money market instruments will depend on the amount of liquidity and safety you need.
If you need investments you can liquidate quickly or you would like to maintain the current value of your portfolio, you might consider putting a larger portion of your investment portfolio in a money market or short-term fixed-income securities.
Investors who do not have liquidity concerns and have a higher risk tolerance will have a smaller portion of their portfolio within these instruments.
As you decide how to allocate your portfolio, you might choose one of several basic allocation strategies. Each offers a different approach based on the investor's time frame, goals, and risk tolerance.
When your portfolio is up and running, it's important to conduct a periodic review. That includes a consideration of how your life and your financial needs have changed. Consider whether it's time to change the weighting of your assets.
Even if your priorities haven't changed, you may find that your portfolio needs to be rebalanced. That is, if a moderately aggressive portfolio racked up a lot of gains from stocks recently, you might move some of that profit into safer money market investments.
Asset allocation is a fundamental investing principle that helps investors maximize profits while minimizing risk. The different asset allocation strategies described above cover a wide range of investment styles, accommodating varying risk tolerance, time frames, and goals.
When you've chosen an asset allocation strategy that's right for you, remember to review your portfolio periodically to ensure that you're maintaining your intended allocation and are still on track for your long-term investment goals.

0.3,"When you buy homeowners insurance, the company you buy it from should provide you with a homeowners insurance declaration page. This document summarizes what’s included in your policy and lists the events or damages that are covered in the policy and those that aren’t covered. It also explains the process for filing a claim.
Also known as a “dec page,” this form specifies your insurance rates, premiums, deductibles, and policy limits.
A homeowners insurance declaration page is essentially a summary of your homeowners insurance coverage. If you need to get information about your policy quickly, you can refer to this document instead of wading through the much more detailed policy.
Insurance companies provide homeowners with a copy of the declaration page when their clients are buying a home and purchasing coverage or when they make changes to an existing policy.
All of these facts are drawn from your policy, but they’re listed in an easy-to-read format, usually on a single page.
A homeowners insurance declaration page may not include all the details of your policy. For example, add-on coverage for events not covered by the main policy may not be included here.
Getting familiar with this document is important, especially if you need to file a claim at some point. The insurance declaration page is a helpful reference if you have questions about your policy.
First, check to make sure that all of your personal information is correct. Make sure that your page has the right name and property address.
Next, look at the coverage types, so that you understand which perils are covered and not covered. For example, a typical homeowners insurance policy includes coverage for fire or theft, but flood insurance or coverage for other types of water damage may need to be purchased separately.
Your form should also list your deductibles for covered events as well as your premium costs. Your premiums may be reduced if you qualify for any discounts, such as a bundling discount if you’re combining homeowners and car insurance or a loyalty discount if you’ve been using the same insurance company for several years.
If you don’t see any discounts listed on your homeowners insurance declaration page, it’s worth a phone call to your insurer to see if you qualify for any.
When you apply for a mortgage to buy a home, the many documents you need to give your lender may include your homeowners insurance declaration page.3 Lenders want to protect themselves from the possible destruction of your property during the time you hold a mortgage. Often, this is called the mortgagee clause.
If you aren't asked to provide a dec page when applying for a mortgage, your lender may ask for one after the purchase closes. Most lenders require mortgage holders to send in an updated copy of the dec page annually as proof that the home is still insured.3 If you should fail to provide this proof of coverage, your lender might purchase coverage on your behalf and charge it as part of your escrow on your monthly payments.
When filing a claim, keep accurate records of conversations you have with your insurance company as well as of any expenses you pay out of pocket.
If your home is damaged, your homeowners insurance declaration page may be able to tell you if the event is covered. If the summary is unclear, you’ll need to reach out to your insurance company. This will be necessary to file a claim anyway.
A standard homeowners insurance policy reimburses you for losses or damage to your property caused by an adverse event like a burglary or a fire.
Damage from certain natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes are not usually covered by a standard policy but can be added on by the homeowner.
Average homeowners insurance costs vary widely by state, from a low of $735 a year in Oregon to a high of $2,165 in Florida.
Many other factors are considered in the rate you are offered, such as the age and condition of your home and its distance from the nearest fire department.
The homeowners insurance declaration page can serve as a quick reference to your coverage for property losses and how to submit a claim for reimbursement. It's also an essential document for obtaining a mortgage.
Before you submit a claim to your insurer, you'll still probably need to contact a company representative in order to clarify the coverage and the process.

A homeowners insurance declarations page lists key details about your policy.
The declarations page has information like coverage limits, deductibles and your annual rate.
Keep your declarations page in a safe place in case you need to make a claim.
A homeowners insurance declarations page is where you’ll find the most important information about your policy. This one- or two-page overview explains things like how much coverage you have, when your policy takes effect and how much it costs.
You may find your full homeowners insurance policy too long or confusing to read word for word. But it’s worth taking a few minutes to look over the declarations page to make sure you have the coverage you expect.
When you buy or renew a homeowners policy, your insurance company will generally send you a copy of the declarations page either in the mail or electronically. You may also be able to access your policy details by logging in to your insurer’s website or mobile app.
If you make changes to your coverage during your policy term, the insurer will likely reissue the declarations page to reflect your new limits.
Your policy’s start and end dates. A typical homeowners policy term is one year.
The address of the insured property. If your mailing address is different, it may appear on the declarations page, too.
The name(s) of the people insured on the policy. These are usually the legal owners of the home. The page may also list the name and address of your mortgage lender, if you have one.
Your policy number and other insurance company information. For example, the policy may list the name and contact details of your local agent, plus the name and address of the insurance company.
Dwelling. Covers the structure of your house.
Other structures. Covers fences or other detached structures.
Personal property. Covers your belongings.
Loss of use. Pays for you to stay elsewhere if your home is unlivable after a covered disaster.
Personal liability. Pays for your legal defense if a court finds you liable for hurting someone else or damaging their property.
Medical payments to others. Covers injuries to others on your property.
Your endorsements. A declarations page may also show additional types of coverage, often called endorsements or riders. These are optional types of coverage that you’ve added to your policy. For example, they might include identity theft insurance or coverage for water damage from backed-up drains.
Your deductibles. A home insurance deductible is the amount subtracted from a claim payout. Your deductible may be a flat amount, such as $1,000, or a percentage of your dwelling coverage. Keep an eye out for multiple deductibles that apply to different types of claims. For instance, you might have a $1,000 deductible for most claims but a 2% deductible for damage from hurricanes.
Your premium and discounts. If your insurer has given you discounts for things like bundling multiple policies or signing up for autopay, the declarations page will often list them. It’ll also show the total cost of your policy.
» MORE: How much homeowners insurance do you need?
The declarations page offers an overview of your coverage, but when it comes to insurance, the details matter.
For instance, the declarations page may say that you have $100,000 worth of coverage for your personal belongings, but it may not tell you that you’re covered for jewelry theft only up to $1,500. Another example: The declarations page notes that you have coverage for the structure of your home up to $250,000. However, it doesn’t mention that the coverage won’t apply to flood or earthquake damage.
For specifics like these, you’ll need to read the policy itself. Look for sections with words like “exclusions” or “special limits” to get a clearer sense of where your coverage might fall short.
For help reading your policy, see our guide to essential terms in your homeowners policy.
Look over the declarations page carefully to make sure your name and address are correct and the coverage, discounts and premium are as expected. If something doesn’t look right or you have questions, reach out to your agent or insurance company.
Your mortgage lender, if you have one, may ask to see your declarations page as proof that you’ve bought adequate insurance for your home.
If it’s not accessible in an online account with your insurer, keep your declarations page and insurance policy in a secure place such as a safe or in the cloud. That way you’ll have important coverage details handy if you need to make a claim after a fire or other disaster.

0.3,"E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN 0.82%) has finally pulled the trigger on plans to do a 20-for-1 stock split this year. That means you'll receive 19 extra shares for every one share of Amazon stock in your portfolio. If you currently have two shares of Amazon stock, you might be jumping for joy when you notice 40 shares in your account after the big day.
Before you get too excited, we'll explain how a stock split works and how it could affect your taxes.
Although it may appear that you've hit the jackpot when you hear about a stock split, it isn't as glamorous as it sounds. You'll receive additional shares of Amazon in your account but the overall value of your shares won't change.
Let's say you owned one share of Amazon stock valued at $3,000 before the split. After a 20-for-1 stock split, you now own 20 shares of stock that are worth $150 per share. The total value of all your shares will still be $3,000.
Stock splits may not have an impact on the value of your shares but they are a great way to entice more people to invest. Instead of paying $3,000 for a share of Amazon, investors will have a chance to own a whole share for $150. If the four-figure stock price kept you from owning a whole share of Amazon in the past, you'll have a chance to join the club after the stock split.
Relax. I'm not about to throw thousands of tax considerations and forms at you. Stock splits are tax-friendly. Because you don't make any money from a stock split in itself, you don't have to cough up any money to the IRS.
Let's go through the entire flow of events so you can understand why stock splits are not taxable.
As you can see from the timeline above, you won't be entitled to extra money because of the stock split. Therefore, you don't have to report this on your taxes. There's nothing mentioned above that would sound off the alarm and make the stock split a taxable event for shareholders.
A stock split in itself won't require you to report any income on your tax return. However, selling Amazon stock before or after the split is a different story.
Let's say you buy a share of Amazon stock before the stock split. Your one share of stock turns into 19 additional shares because of the 20-for-1 stock split. If the stock goes up and you decide to pull the trigger and sell half your shares immediately following the split, you'll be on the hook for short-term capital gains taxes. Those tax rates can be as high as 37% if you're a high earner.
If you hang on to your shares for over a year before selling, you'll have a chance to unlock the long-term capital gains rates. Investors enjoy capital gains rates because they can get a deal on their tax bill. Below are the 2022 long-term capital gains rates in case you're thinking about pressing the sell button.

If you already own shares of Amazon, you will wake up to additional shares in your account in June if the stock split goes through. The best part is that you don't have to do any legwork to gain access to the shares. Your brokerage will take care of the logistics while you celebrate what's ahead for this tech behemoth. On top of that, you won't receive a tax bill from the IRS because of the stock split. If you believe in Amazon's future potential, it won't be a bad idea to hang on to all your shares and cheer on the company's growth.

This includes dividends, realized capital gains and interest. Qualified dividends are payments made from business profits after taxes and are taxed at 15% for most shareholders who fall within certain income thresholds.2 Stock splits are not a taxable event, but they do affect cost basis for a shareholder.3 To determine when and how much tax is owed for one of these events, look at the following criteria and review basic investing tax rules.
Stock splits are quite different from dividends, as they are not distributions of business profits. When trying to understand stock splits or reverse splits, realize they are merely a restructuring of shares outstanding and price per share; no tax is incurred. For example, an investor owns 100 shares of ABC at $80 per share for a total cost of $8,000. If the company issues a 2-for-1 split, the investor then owns 200 shares at $40 per share but his total cost remains the same, so no gain or loss is incurred. The stock split affects only the cost basis per share. If no further investments are made into ABC, figuring the cost basis when the shares are sold is not difficult. Figuring cost basis can be tricky when additional purchases are made after a stock split.
Stock splits are generally not taxable, as the cost basis per share is updated to reflect the new stock structure and price so that the total market value is the same. Since you did not make any gains on the stock split, no taxes are owed.

0.285714285714286,"Economic profit (or loss) expresses the total value of a business decision – It is calculated by taking the difference between revenue generated and both the explicit and implicit (aka opportunity) costs associated with it.
Economic profit (or loss) is the amount of money a company earns (or loses), after accounting for the direct and indirect expenses of doing business. Critically, the calculation factors in the indirect opportunity cost – the value of the alternative choice that the business could have made. Conversely, accounting profit only considers explicit costs (aka money paid to others for time or assets). Economic profit additionally includes the interest, rent, sales, and wages that weren’t earned because the company decided to allocate its resources elsewhere. It assigns a monetary value to unpursued routes, and allows a company to compare its decision to pursue its chosen path to what it may have otherwise done. These implicit costs don’t show up on the company’s financial statements and don’t have to be disclosed publicly, but they're costs nonetheless.
The fictitious company Tally's T-shirts has a dilemma. It can't decide between 100% cotton or a cotton polyester blend for its shirts. If it sources 100% cotton, it can charge $30 per shirt, but its material cost per unit will be $5. If it sources the cotton polyester blend, its material cost per shirt would be $2.50, but it could only charge $20 per shirt. Either way, Tally's estimates it can sell 1000 shirts per month.
If Tally’s chooses 100% cotton, its monthly revenue would be $30,000. Once subtracting the explicit costs for materials of $5,000, the total monthly profit would be $25,000. However, if the business chooses cotton polyester, its monthly revenue would be $20,000. Once removing the explicit costs for materials of $2,500, the total monthly profit would be $17,500.
By choosing the 100% cotton material, Tally's can realize an economic profit of $7,500 — the cotton profit of $25,000 minus the opportunity cost of the cotton polyester profit of $17,500.
If you use fertilizer on your tomatoes, there’s a good chance that you’ll end up with some large, juicy delicious tomatoes. But you won’t really know how much credit that fertilizer deserves unless you’re able to compare a tomato grown with the fertilizer to one grown without it. The difference between two tomatoes in size and juiciness is the extra boost that you can assign to the fertilizer. In the same way, economic profit or loss captures the difference in value between doing one thing versus another – It doesn’t look at profit in isolation, it also examines what the alternative profit would have been.

Economic profit (or loss) expresses the total value of a business decision – It is the difference between revenue generated and the explicit and implicit (aka opportunity) costs associated with it.
Explicit costs refer to the easily quantifiable out-of-pocket expenditures made to produce something – These often include items like wages, rents, and raw materials. Meanwhile, implicit (aka opportunity) costs quantify the value of an alternative choice — These typically capture the amount of money that is sacrificed by choosing one path over another.
Calculating economic profit is useful for determining how much better (or worse) one business decision is over another. It’s a type of “what-if” analysis – Economic profit (or loss) compares the gains (or losses) from one choice to what would have happened if you had picked an alternative route.
For example, imagine a small electronics company has $4M in capital it wants to invest. If it loans out the money to others, it estimates its profits will be $1.6M after five years. If, however, it starts a new product line, the company estimates a return of $500K in revenue less explicit costs (labor, raw materials, etc.) of $200K for total profit of $300K per year. Over five years, its total profits would come to $1.5M with a new product. The company decides to loan out the money rather than start a new product line because the economic profit — taking into account the $1.5M in opportunity cost of not starting a new product line — is $100K with much less the effort.
Economic profit differs from accounting profit (aka total revenue minus explicit costs) because it also includes these implicit values for alternative paths that didn’t occur. These implicit costs are intangible and somewhat arbitrary based on market conditions and management calculations, so they don't show up on company financial statements. Economic profit is more of an internal metric that businesses use to ensure that managers are maximizing profits and choosing the most optimal path. Corporations don’t pay taxes on economic profit and investors don’t typically get to see this figure .
When a company makes a positive economic profit, it is called supernormal profits. Supernormal profits attract competition into the market – As more competitors enter, economic profit theoretically will eventually erode to zero.
Companies can still earn an accounting profit when economic profit is zero. When economic profit is zero, that just means that the profit the company is making isn’t higher than if it were doing something else with its capital.
For example, assume a company invests $1M into developing a new product. That product generates an accounting profit of $75,000 per year – a 7.5% return on investment. If the company could have earned the same 7.5% return on a product that would have been the best alternative, then its economic profit is zero even though its accounting profit is positive.
Calculating economic profit requires three pieces of information: total revenue, explicit costs, and implicit costs.
Consider this simple example. Joe decides to leave his job and open a coffee cart so he can start living life as his own boss. At the end of one year, Joe does his taxes and reports $100,000 in sales. The coffee grounds, paper cups, lids, coffee sleeves, flavoring, and other materials add up to $50,000. It looks like he made $50,000 in profit.
From a pure accounting profit perspective, that’s true. But, from an economic profit perspective, the story isn’t over.
To know whether Joe truly made a profitable decision, considering alternatives, you have to consider the implicit cost. Say Joe left a job that paid $60,000 a year – In this case, he didn’t actually make an economic profit. Had he never opened his business, he'd have earned $10,000 more than he did in year one. That means his economic profit from opening his coffee cart was actually -$10,000 in the first year – an economic loss.
Even though Joe had an economic loss in year one, there might be other intangible factors that should be considered here. For example, maybe Joe is perfectly willing to lose $10,000 a year for the personal satisfaction of running his own business. He may also make radically more in the second year, which could offset the short-term economic loss.
Although economic profit expresses amounts in dollars, the concept is meant to capture non-monetary costs and benefits. Ideally, you’re able to put a price on implicit costs and benefits when calculating economic profit. Of course, that’s not easy to do in practice and the value can differ by individual and business, depending on management and existing market conditions.
An opportunity cost is the value of an alternative choice that an individual, investor, or business misses out on when making another decision instead. That is, it's what you give up when you choose to do one thing instead of another. For instance, if you buy $1,000 of common stock, that means you’re not using that $1,000 to buy a bond. The money you don’t earn from the bond is the opportunity cost associated with buying the stock.
Opportunity costs extend to every aspect of life. Whenever you have to make a choice, you’re giving up the value of the path not taken and opportunity costs try to capture the monetary value of that alternative. Economic profit accounts for these opportunity costs via implicit costs to express how good one business decision is relative to another.
Accounting profit is what shows up on an income statement and what you most likely think of when you hear the term profit. Meanwhile, economic profit captures how good an investment really is as compared to its alternatives.
Accounting profit appears on a company’s financial statements. In short, it captures the amount of income generated after subtracting all explicit expenses from revenue generated over a given period of time. At the bottom of the income statement is net income, which subtracts all of the explicit expenses – This is also known as accounting profit.
However, financial statements don’t capture any implicit costs. In other words, they don’t factor in the lost earning power of capital while it’s invested elsewhere. Nor do they express how a company’s property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) could generate rent if those items were leased rather than used directly by the business.
Economic profit accounts for these invisible costs that don’t show up in the standard accounting profit. It is a truer measure of profit, considering alternatives, rather than a straightforward accounting of money. When a business understands implicit costs, it may seek creative ways to mitigate them. For example, a company might decide to move its operations to a warehouse with lower rent and lease out the warehouse it owns for a higher rent to recoup some of those opportunity costs.
Economic profit is important because it assigns an economic value to the choice a company didn’t make. While accounting records every monetary transaction, it misses unseen costs of pursuing one path over an alternative one. Not everything that matters involves dollars changing hands. A lot of things have economic value, even if they don’t come with a tangible price tag. Economic profit tries to capture those invisible costs and benefits by assigning a dollar value to them.
For instance, when you mow your lawn or wash your dishes, no money changes hands. So, there's no record of that activity in your bank account. But those things do have value. Economic profit tries to capture that fact. You might spend two hours mowing your lawn instead of paying the kid next door $20 dollars to do it for you. But if you're an accountant who charges $70 per hour, instead of saving $20 dollars, you're actually losing $120.
If you work for yourself, economic value says you should record a salary even if you don’t take a paycheck so that you can truly capture the economic value of your labor. If you own a piece of equipment, economic profit says you should charge yourself a rental fee to quantify the economic value of the equipment’s potential alternative use. And, if you use your life savings to invest in a business, economic profit believes you should account for the investment earnings you'd have made if you left it in a retirement account.

Economic profit differs from net income because it subtracts opportunity costs, which are the profits forfeited by choosing one course of action over another.
Economic profit (or loss) is what remains after deducting both normal accounting expenses and the cost of pursuing one business strategy instead of another. If a company chooses the more profitable of two business options, then it accrues economic profit, and if it chooses the less-profitable option, then it incurs economic loss.
Regulators don't require economic profit to be calculated or disclosed, but understanding how it works can shed light on the decisions a management team makes, plus confer some lessons in personal finance.
Economic profit (or loss) can be calculated as revenue minus explicit costs minus opportunity cost. Explicit costs are all costs typically accounted for, such as labor expenses, materials costs, marketing, depreciation, and taxes. As previously noted, opportunity or implicit cost is the theoretical cost for a company of not pursuing a business option.
Let's say a steel manufacturing company owns raw steel it could sell for $1 million, or it could use the same raw steel to manufacture steel products, which it can then sell to consumers for $3 million. The company decides to manufacture steel products and earns $3 million, but it incurs expenses of $2.5 million.
The company's accounting profit is $500,000, and its economic profit is the accounting profit minus the $1 million in sales it could have earned by simply selling unfinished steel. Rather than accruing an economic profit, the company, at least in the short term, incurs an economic loss of $500,000.
Economic profit is best calculated over long time horizons because short-term economic losses often become long-term economic profits. The same steel manufacturing company could conceivably lower its production costs in subsequent years, which would turn the initial economic loss to a long-term economic profit.
If manufacturing steel products is expected to produce an economic profit for the company in the long term, than it would be acceptable to incur the short-term economic loss by forgoing the income from selling raw steel.

Accounting profit, better known as net income, is the money that remains in a reporting period after direct expenses such as labor, fixed expenses like rent, and non-operating expenses such as taxes and depreciation, are subtracted from revenue.
While accounting profit is calculated and used by investors, economic profit is more relevant for a company's management. Companies are required to report accounting profit, while opportunity cost assessments and resulting economic profit numbers are rarely revealed.
Are you ready to jump into the stock market? We've got you.
Similar to gambling, investors try to profit on market ups and downs. Is it worth it?
The best companies calculate economic profit to make informed business decisions and profitably allocate their resources. But because economic profit or loss is generally not disclosed, the metric isn't too helpful for deciding whether to buy a stock. Instead, investors should evaluate a company's management team and its track record of entering new markets to drive overall growth.
The same concept of economic profit management teams utilize can be useful on a personal level. For instance, you might use the economic profit concept to determine whether to start a business.
Let's say you expect a new business endeavor to generate $100,000 in year one, while it will only cost $80,000 to get started. Your accounting profit would be $20,000. However, in order to start the business, you would need to quit your full-time job and reduce to part-time hours, forgoing $50,000 in income in year one.
The economic loss to you would be negative $30,000 for the first year ($100,000 of revenue minus $80,000 of start-up costs minus $50,000 of lost income). You might decide to go ahead with this plan, though, if there are no other start-up costs after year one, your ongoing expenses significantly drop, and your revenue increases. The initial economic loss could become a long-term economic profit.
The same principle can be used in other ways when deciding how to spend or invest your money. Perhaps you have a choice between buying a new car with a warranty or a used car with no warranty. The new car has a higher up-front expense but lower maintenance expenses for a time, while the used car has a lower up-front purchase price but higher maintenance expenses. The same concept applies to buying or renting a home and investing money. Considering economic profit or loss can help you make better long-term financial decisions.

0.285714285714286,"Suicide was among the nine leading causes of death for people ages 10-64 in 2021.1 Though life insurance can provide coverage in the case of suicide, many policies have special provisions that limit the payment of benefits.
Insurance companies want to prevent people from having a financial incentive to take their own lives. That’s why many life insurance policies have a suicide clause, also known as a suicide provision.
With individual term life insurance, beneficiaries can claim the death benefit as long as the exclusion period has ended. If the person dies after the policy has been in effect for one to two years, the beneficiaries are entitled to the full benefit. But if the person dies during the exclusion period, the beneficiaries might receive only the sum of premiums paid to date.
With whole life policies, the beneficiaries might receive the plan’s cash value even if the covered person dies during the exclusion period. When the exclusion period ends, the beneficiaries can receive the full death benefit and cash value.
When a policyholder dies and their beneficiaries file a claim, the insurance company will request a death certificate. The death certificate would describe the cause of death and note if the person's death was self-inflicted.
If the death certificate is inconclusive or includes a questionable cause of death, the insurance company may require additional documentation, such as an autopsy report, a medical examiner report, an emergency medical services (EMS) report, or the person's medical records.
While the claims process can be more complex and time-consuming, beneficiaries shouldn't let that deter them from filing a claim. They may be entitled to benefits that could help them financially as they try to recover from the tragedy.
Some life insurance policies can provide coverage in the case of suicide, but many of them contain special provisions, called suicide clauses, that limit the payment of benefits.
If changes are made to a life insurance policy, including adding coverage or converting a term policy into a whole life policy, that can reset the clock, causing the exclusion period for potential coverage of a suicide to start over.
Yes, due to additional time often needed by an insurance company to investigate a suicide, benefit payout may be delayed. The insurer may require further documentation, including an autopsy report, a medical examiner report, or the deceased's medical records.
Life insurance may provide coverage in the case of suicide, but many policies have provisions that limit the payment of death benefits in these circumstances. Benefits also may be denied if the policy is relatively new, usually within the first two years of coverage, which is called the exclusion period.
Many group life policies don't have a suicide clause that affects benefit payments, but most term life policies carry exclusion periods when a death by suicide occurs. With whole life policies, beneficiaries might be paid the plan’s cash value, even if the covered person dies during the exclusion period. However, such provisions shouldn't keep beneficiaries from filing a claim because they may be entitled to benefits that could be helpful in a difficult period.

Along with the profound and painful questions that follow the loss of a loved one from suicide, there are practical and financial issues to address, too.
If the loved one had life insurance, a common question is whether the policy will still cover the death.
Had group life insurance through work.
Was insured under an individual policy that went into effect more than two years ago (one year in some states).
Was insured under coverage that he or she purchased through work and that went into effect more than two years ago (one year in some states).
Even if the death is not covered, it’s important to follow up with the life insurance company.
If the claim is denied because of suicide, the beneficiary is typically owed a return of the premiums. This means the beneficiary would receive a sum of money equal to the amount the policyholder paid in premiums for coverage.
How a life insurance policy will handle suicide depends in part on the type of coverage — individual versus employer-paid group life insurance. Individual policies are the kind you buy on your own; group life insurance is the kind you get through an organization, such as an employer.
Individual life insurance policies usually contain a suicide clause, which means they don’t pay out claims for deaths caused by suicide within a specified period of time. In most states, this exclusion lasts the first two years after the policy goes into effect. Colorado, Missouri and North Dakota have a one-year suicide clause.
Insurance companies and regulators consider that this is sufficient time to prevent policies from being purchased by someone who intends to commit suicide.
If a suicide occurs during the exclusion period, the insurer will typically provide a return of premiums paid to the policy’s beneficiary, minus any outstanding payments. With cash value life insurance policies, any unpaid loans and interest will be deducted from the payout amount.
If death from suicide occurs after this period, then the life insurance policy will pay out as it would for death from illness or other insured causes.
Group life insurance at work — if the employer pays for it — typically does not contain a suicide clause. So if your loved one had employer-paid life insurance through work, then the coverage generally will pay a benefit. Contact the employer’s human resources department to learn how to file a life insurance claim.
However, supplemental life insurance that employees purchase treats suicide much the way individual policies do, excluding it during the first one or two years. If the death occurred during the excluded period, the premiums the employee paid for the coverage would typically be returned to the beneficiary.
You are not alone if you’re dealing with the aftermath of suicide. It is the 12th leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention [1]American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Suicide Data: United States. Accessed Feb 8, 2023.View all sources .
If you’re picking up the pieces after losing someone from suicide, the important thing to remember about life insurance is not to let the cause of death keep you from filing a claim.

Unless their parents have somehow saved enough money—or earn massive salaries—most students need to borrow to pay for college today. Working your way through college is also largely a thing of the past. Few students can make enough to pay for college while they're also taking classes. For that reason, student loans (and debt) have become increasingly common. Here's what you need to know about applying.
The first step in applying for student loans is to fill out the government's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA asks a series of questions about the student's and parents' income and investments, in addition to other relevant matters. Based on the information you supply, the FAFSA will calculate your Student Aid Index (SAI), formerly known as the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). That's the amount of money the government believes you should be able to pay for college for the coming school year out of your own financial resources.
You can complete the FAFSA online at the office of the Federal Student Aid website.1 To save time, round up all of your account information before you sit down to start work on it. You must not only complete the FAFSA when you first apply for aid but every year after that if you hope to continue receiving aid.
The financial aid offices at the colleges you apply to will use the information from your FAFSA to determine how much aid to make available to you. They compute your need by subtracting your EFC from their cost of attendance (COA). Cost of attendance includes tuition, mandatory fees, room and board, and some other expenses. It can be found on most colleges' websites.
In order to bridge the gap between your EFC and their COA, colleges will put together an aid package that may include federal Pell Grants and paid work-study, in addition to loans. Grants, unlike loans, do not need to be paid back, except in rare instances. They are intended for students with what the government considers ""exceptional financial need.""
Award letters can differ from college to college, so it's important to compare them side by side. In terms of loans, you'll want to look at how much money each school offers and whether the loans are subsidized or unsubsidized.
If you qualify, a college might offer you both subsidized and unsubsidized loans.
Federal loans have a number of advantages over student loans from banks and other private lenders. They have relatively low, fixed interest rates (private loans often have variable rates) and offer a variety of flexible repayment plans.
Private student loans lack the flexible repayment options available with federal loans.
Another option if you need to borrow more money than federal student loans can provide is to apply for a private loan from a bank, credit union, or other financial institution.
Private loans are available regardless of need, and you apply for them using the financial institution's own forms rather than the FAFSA. To obtain a private loan, you will need to have a good credit rating or get someone who does have one, such as a parent or other relative, to co-sign on the loan.
Having less-than-stellar credit can make it difficult to qualify for student loans. Private lenders will consider your income and credit history, and as a college student, you likely have poor credit or no credit at all. However, some lenders offer student loan options for borrowers with bad credit.
Generally, private loans carry higher interest rates than federal loans, and these rates are variable rather than fixed, which adds some uncertainty to the question of how much you'll eventually owe. Private loans also lack the flexible repayment plans available with federal loans and are not eligible for loan consolidation under the Federal Direct Consolidation Loan program. However, you can refinance your private loans after you graduate, possibly at a lower interest rate.
Each college will notify you of how much aid it is offering around the same time that you receive your official acceptance. This is often referred to as an award letter. In addition to federal aid, colleges may make money available out of their own funds, such as merit or athletic scholarships.
How much you'll have to borrow to attend one school versus another may not be the most important factor in choosing a college. But it should definitely be high on the list. Graduating from college with an unmanageable amount of debt—or, worse still, taking on debt and not graduating—is not only a burden that might keep you up at night; it can limit—or even derail—your career and life choices for years to come. Also factor in the future careers you are considering when you choose to pay more for college. A career with a high entry-level salary will put you in a better position to repay your loans and justify taking on more debt.
To qualify for a federal loan, you will need to complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Borrowers must answer questions about the student's and parents' income and investments, in addition to other relevant matters. Using that information, the FAFSA determines the Student Aid Index (SAI). That figure is used to calculate how much assistance you're eligible to receive.
Federal loans have relatively low, fixed interest rates (private loans often have variable rates) and offer a variety of flexible repayment plans. Private loans, unlike those from the government, aren't based on financial need. Borrowers may have to pass a credit check to prove their creditworthiness. Borrowers with little or no credit history, or a poor score, may need a co-signer on the loan. Private loans may also have higher borrowing limits than federal loans.
Student loans are among the resources available to help families pay college bills. Private and federal loans have advantages and disadvantages depending on your situation. Private loans, administered by banks and credit unions, are much like any other kind of loan, meaning a credit check will be required. Federal loans are often needs-based with lower interest rates and flexibility in repayment. Those who do the required legwork will find options that best meet their needs.

How to apply: Wondering where to apply for student loans first?
Most students — 7 in 10 — borrow money to pay for college. If you're one, you have two types of student loans to choose from: federal or private.
If you're an undergraduate, always start with federal loans. They don't require a credit history or a co-signer and they offer more generous protections for borrowers, such as income-driven repayment and loan forgiveness, than private student loans do.
Before you borrow, think ahead to how you’ll repay debt. Put a dollar figure on it by using a student loan payment calculator. This is the bill you’ll be paying every month for 10 years or longer. Borrow only what you need, and don’t take on an amount or an interest rate you can’t expect to handle right after graduation.
Here's how you can get federal and private student loans.
Submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, to find out how much financial aid you may qualify for, such as grants, scholarships and work-study, that won’t have to be repaid. It takes about 30 minutes to complete. Each school you apply to will use the FAFSA to determine your financial aid; the gap between aid and cost of attendance is what you have to cover.
» MORE: How much financial aid will I get?
The FAFSA serves as your application for federal student loans as well. You’ll be notified of what you can borrow in the financial aid award letter from any school that accepts you. There are two types of federal loans: subsidized and unsubsidized.
Subsidized federal loans go to undergraduate students with a financial need. The subsidy covers the interest on the loan while you’re in school. Unsubsidized federal loans aren’t based on need, and interest starts to accrue immediately.
» MORE: How much can you get in student loans?
Consider private student loans to cover any remaining costs after grants, scholarships, work-study and federal loans. They're a viable option if you have good credit or a co-signer who does.
Banks, credit unions, state-based agencies and online lenders all offer student loans. Shop around with multiple lenders, weighing repayment flexibility and forbearance options as well as the interest rates offered.
Most private lenders will require borrowers to have good credit and an income that can support loan payments while meeting other debts (in other words, a low debt-to-income ratio). If you don't meet those qualifications, you'll need a co-signer who can.
Private lenders don't technically list a co-signer as a requirement, but you'll have difficulty getting a private loan without one. About 87% of all new undergraduate private student loans had a co-signer for the 2020-21 academic year, according to a 2021 report by MeasureOne.
If you don't have a co-signer, a few private lenders gear loans toward independent students, but you’ll pay more.
» MORE:   Should you co-sign a student loan?
Graduate students loans include two federal loan options, along with private loans.

0.277777777777778,"Things looked like they were going great for the stock market early Monday, as the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.82%), Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 0.95%), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 0.41%) all jumped out to big gains around midday.
Yet those advances reversed course throughout the afternoon, and in the end, only the Nasdaq managed to hold onto any gains at all.
Even as stocks have tried to rebound from a tough year in 2022, investors in the bond market have also looked for signs of a potential recovery. So far, 2023 has been relatively kind to some bond investments, although most of them still have a long way to go to make back all of their lost ground over the past year.
Bond-market declines in 2022 were noteworthy for their size. Exchange-traded funds following standard broad-based bond benchmarks were down 13% in 2022, while some long-term bond funds suffered losses of 30% or more.
In the opening days of 2023, however, bond markets have moved the other way. That has helped push the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT -0.48%) up almost 6% early in January. Bond ETFs with a wider set of holdings, including the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG -0.20%) and the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND -0.19%), have gained more than 2% in just over a week of trading this year.
The reason is counterintuitive. Even though the Federal Reserve has remained adamant about keeping monetary policy tight in order to fight inflation, the central bank's direct impact on rates is largely limited to those on short-term bonds. The federal funds rate, for instance, is an overnight rate, and most of the bond benchmarks that follow it are for relatively short-term debt obligations more often measured in months than in years.
Short-term rates have indeed stayed high, but longer-term interest rates have started to come down. That's particularly important for the price action of the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF, which concentrates its investment focus on long-dated debt issued by the U.S. Treasury.
It's reasonable to wonder how long-term rates could fall if short-term rates are rising. The answer is that investors don't believe that the Fed will be able to sustain short-term interest rates at current levels for very long. Lower long-term rates essentially represent their predominant view: that future interest rates will fall so low that it's smarter now to lock in a rate below current short-term rates.
As important as the stock market is, the bond market is also huge and has a major impact on the financial industry. Keeping an eye on bonds makes sense even if you're primarily a stock investor. And it'll be interesting to see if 2023 turns out to be a better year for bonds than 2022 was.

0.275862068965517,"On the surface, product sourcing is a pretty straightforward process. You identify your product, find a supplier, fill your inventory, sell your items online, and you’re all set. But the process is really much more complicated than that.
Finding quality products at great prices and with good profit margins requires research and trial and error. Plus, with online shoppers projected to increase to 278.33 million by 2024 in the U.S. alone, online selling will only become more competitive, making it even more difficult for e-commerce business owners to source their products.
Product sourcing is the process of obtaining quality products to sell. The products are often obtained from reliable retail suppliers and manufacturers at a reasonable price. The method includes researching, calculating the product’s price and acquisition costs, vetting reputable suppliers, and negotiating to get the best deals.
Ultimately, your product sourcing strategy should lead you to find quality products at prices that allow for significant profit margins.
Understand the different product sourcing methods to determine which ones work best for your business and support your e-commerce strategies.
Selling handmade products has its advantages. First, you don’t need to rely on third-party providers to manufacture your products from the ground up. You only source the needed materials and then make the product in-house.
Second, you have more control over the production process. This allows you to scrutinize and optimize every step of the manufacturing operation. Third, it’s easier to regulate production. If needed, you can create just a handful of products. This isn’t always an option when working with manufacturers or other suppliers since they typically require a minimum number of orders.
The tricky bit when selling handmade products is scaling. If your sales suddenly skyrocket, your production needs to be able to keep up.
Develop good relationships with reliable wholesale distributors. Doing so opens untold opportunities for your business. You can negotiate better payment terms, get discounts, or perhaps obtain exclusivity on certain products they’re selling.
Work with individual makers or sellers or partner with existing companies with their own production line and those wanting to take their business online (among others).
Although sourcing products from manufacturers is often cheaper than from wholesale distributors, you still need to buy in bulk since most manufacturers have minimum order quantity requirements.
If you’re a startup, pay very close attention to your budget. In most cases, it makes more sense to choose other lower-cost product sourcing methods than to work with manufacturers.
The dropshipping model lets you list the products of suppliers on your online shop and start selling without keeping inventory or handling product fulfillment and packaging.
The suppliers charge you for the products as you sell them, and they ship the orders directly to your customers on your behalf. E-commerce platforms such as Shopify make dropshipping easy by letting you integrate the Oberlo e-commerce solution and find verified suppliers and products from one location.
Go to Oberlo to find products to sell. With one click, import all product information from the supplier, including the image and the description and other marketing materials, to your Shopify store.
You’ll also get supplier information by clicking on the name, plus you’ll know which vendors are verified. This streamlines the product sourcing process for your online business, click and mortar store, and other online selling ventures.
Conferences, exhibitions, and trade shows are some of the best places to do market research. Use such events to see products up close, learn more about the supplier or seller, and pick up industry trends. It’s an opportune time to network and build strategic relationships with wholesalers, manufacturers, and independent retailers selling products uncommon to the market.
Product sourcing marketplaces give you access to a broad spectrum of suppliers and various products, complete with specifications and other crucial details.
For instance, B2B e-commerce platform Alibaba presents thousands of suppliers, manufacturers, and products. It has features that let you search with ease, allowing you to better manage your inventory.
On the Alibaba platform, you can search for products by typing in keywords, filter by category, submit a request for a quote to advertise the product you want to be manufactured, verify suppliers, etc.
Trading agents and sourcing companies work as middlemen between you and your manufacturers. They offer support throughout the process by communicating directly with your manufacturers, helping with quality control, and checking on the production process for you.
This lets you delegate manufacturing-related responsibilities to reliable third parties and benefit from their expertise and established connections. That, in turn, allows you to focus on your front-end business processes.
The product sourcing method you choose has far-reaching effects on your business. The right process can reduce your expenses while improving your efficiency, while the wrong one can lead to delays, unnecessary costs, and frustrations.
Consider these tips when choosing a product sourcing method.
Pay very close attention to your business process, then choose a product sourcing method that seamlessly integrates with your current dynamics. For instance, assess whether sourcing from wholesalers works better with your inventory control and management than working directly with manufacturers.
Remember that product sourcing isn’t just about product quality and cost. There are processes involved, relationships that need to be built, payment terms and other arrangements that have to be agreed upon, etc. The more information you gather during research, the better your chances of choosing the right product sourcing method.
Instead of conceptualizing or developing a product sourcing method from scratch, study your competitors so you have a starting framework to build upon. You save time, effort, and resources by doing so.It isn’t always easy to obtain information about your competitors’ product sourcing methods. However, if you persevere in asking around, you’re bound to get clues about their process. You can even email your competitors’ customer support team to ask about where or how they’re sourcing their products. You’ll be surprised how some will give you the information you’re looking for.
While product sourcing consists of several variables and elements, you can still develop a process that fits your business just by learning the basics, giving research due diligence, and taking action.
Also, remember to track your results. It allows you to pinpoint which parts of your product sourcing process are problematic and filled with inefficiencies and which are bringing you meaningful results.

Sourcing profitable products is job number one for most online sellers, and there are many ways to fill up those virtual shelves.
When you work directly with product manufacturers, you cut out the wholesale middlemen — and their markups — leaving you with more profit in your pocket. Direct source products also provide endless ways to create unique goods that set your brand apart from the competition.
Basic Plan. Shopify & Advanced Plans Available.
Working directly with manufacturers might seem daunting at first. Visions of overseas trips, product design costs and huge prepaid initial orders generally come to mind. However, the global manufacturing marketplace is surprisingly small-business-friendly these days.
Higher profits: Most wholesalers make their money by marking up manufacturer prices as much as 15% to 25%. Sourcing goods directly from the manufacturer leaves this markup in your pocket instead of depositing it into your wholesaler’s piggy bank.
Customized products: It’s impossible to stand out online when your products exactly match your competitors’ goods. With direct source products, you can make slight or extensive modifications to a manufacturer’s stock goods to offer products with unique benefits and branding.
Made-to-order goods: Direct source products let you create made-to-order items to your exact design and specifications. Called “contract manufacturing,” this type of direct sourcing involves the most upfront work and cost, but lets you create products that are 100% unique to your brand.
Learning curve: Direct sourcing is more complex than placing a quick order with a wholesaler. You need to understand all the moving parts, make a professional impression and know what it takes to land a good deal.
Compliance issues: Government compliance requirements in materials, design, packaging and labeling vary for different types of goods. Understanding the rules specific to your products is a must in direct sourcing.
Large orders: Manufacturers typically have higher minimum order quantities — called MOQ in purchasing lingo — than wholesalers. For example, a wholesaler’s MOQ might be a case of 12 units, but a manufacturer’s MOQ for might be 48, 96 or 144 units.
Funding purchases: Most manufacturers require upfront payment, so many e-commerce sellers must turn to credit cards or other inventory financing options to place direct orders.
International deals: Sellers often turn to overseas manufacturers in China and India for low-cost direct source products. This is a very profitable strategy, but it comes with challenges such as overseas shipping, customs, cultural differences and the risk of scammers.
Clearly, there are some drawbacks to purchasing direct source products, but done right, the profit and branding potential far outweigh the risks. Next, Let's detail how you can direct source products to sell online in your own e-commerce store.
As you move down the direct sourcing path, you’re sure to fine-tune each step into a system that works for you. Until then, this overview will get you started on the right foot.
Whether you’re starting from scratch or already know what you want to sell, it’s smart to head to Amazon for your initial product research. Browsing Amazon’s vast catalog gives you insight into what products are selling well within your target category, as well as a snapshot of current pricing. Plus, it can help you spot and brainstorm profitable sales opportunities for other direct source products.
On Amazon, browse the Trending Products and Best Seller List pages within categories that complement your brand or business concept. These pages list top-selling products in both broad and niche categories — like horse halters and accessories in the example below.
Here, you can see what’s popular with shoppers now, plus gather two key points of product research — product pricing and popular features. You’ll use this information to define specifications for your own direct source products.
Use Amazon’s pricing (or pricing found on other websites) to gauge an average price range for the products you hope to sell. Next, estimate a target cost for your direct source products.
If you plan to sell items on Amazon, your product cost should be around 30% of its retail price in order to be profitable after paying Amazon’s seller fees. If selling on your own website, you can usually get away with a cost that’s 40% to 55% of your retail price.
A major goal of any direct sourcing strategy is offering products that beat the competition. For that, you have to know what the competition is offering and find or develop a product that beats it. Again, you can use Amazon and other category-specific websites to spot features common in top-selling items.
Using our example above, you see that most top-selling halters feature an adjustable noseband and quick-release cheek clip. If we want to sell halters, we should include these features — and improve on them if possible.
It’s also important to note that a top-selling item in this category is a tie ring, not a halter. Further research might uncover this as a profitable product to focus on in addition to (or in place of) halters.
After you settle on an item to sell and know its average selling price, target cost and must-have features, you’re ready to search for potential direct source suppliers. There are many manufacturing options for direct source products, and you can start your search several ways.
Online marketplaces are the go-to tool for many e-commerce sellers looking to direct source products to sell online. One option is Alibaba, which is particularly popular with startups and small businesses. Other options to explore include Globalsources, IndiaMART, ChinaBrands, ThomasNet and FGmarkets.
Most of these marketplaces have vendor assurance and verification standards that protect buyers from scammers.
Most direct source product manufacturer marketplaces offer a wealth of information on supplier pages to help speed up your search. Pricing for various order quantities and important information like supplier ratings, response time and buyer protection like Alibaba’s Trade Assurance program is prominently displayed.
Standard item specifications, packaging, shipping and customization options can also be found on the product pages of these large direct source marketplace websites.
You can also find independent factories through trade shows and buyers’ markets, or use ThomasNet and FGmarkets, which list many U.S. manufacturers.
Consultants like ChinaImportal can help you navigate the often murky waters of contract manufacturing for made-to-order goods. This can add costs; however, knowledgeable pros will guide you from design and tooling through production and delivery, and help you avoid mistakes along the way.
Most private label suppliers are manufacturers and offer an array of custom options. Private label vendors produce stock goods that can be customized with your own label or packaging, and most also offer semi-customized goods and fully made-to-order services.
Once you’ve identified manufacturers who produce items that are similar to what you wish to sell and close to your target cost, it’s time to contact them to discuss your unique needs. On Alibaba and similar marketplaces, you’ll communicate via chat or email. If you find manufacturers at trade shows, buyers’ markets or through other means, you’ll converse via email and phone.
This stage of the conversation focuses on what you want your product to be. A supplier might already make the exact item that you’re looking for, but you’d like a specific color or special packaging. Or, you might want to add feature improvements like a padded noseband on a halter, or a matching lead rope to sell as a set.
You’ll also want to ask if goods meet product and packaging compliance standards for the countries in which you intend to sell.
If you’re looking for a completely new, made-to-order good, you can ask manufacturers of similar goods about custom design and manufacturing services. Remember, you don’t always have to reinvent the wheel when it comes to new product development. Sometimes starting with something similar, and adding specific alterations and improvements is the most economical solution.
Offer as much detail as possible with any semi-custom or made-to-order request. Fully describe item specifications, materials, finishes, dimensions and so on. Include formal plans or mockup images, technical drawings or at least some good sketches or samples of similar goods with changes noted. Also include product and packaging compliance requirements for the country or countries in which you intend to sell.
Soon, you’ll have a shortlist of potential manufacturers who can do the work. Pricing is the next step.
Once you’ve chosen an item and settled on any custom needs, it’s time to talk numbers and terms with your shortlist of potential manufacturers. This is typically handled under a “Request for Quote,” or RFQ in purchasing lingo. It’s imperative that you approach this step as a seasoned pro, even if it’s your first rodeo. You want to sound knowledgeable so potential partners take you seriously and offer a favorable deal.
Here are the elements of the deal that you need to cover in your RFQ. Of course, numbers, quantities and other factors will vary depending on the type of product you’re planning to purchase and the type of manufacturer you’ll be using.
Item specifications: Include a complete description of the product you’re ordering. If it has custom features or is made-to-order, include all design specs, drawings or imagery, dimensions, materials, colors, packaging and labeling requirements.
Order quantities: Confirm the minimum order quantity (MOQ) that the manufacturer will accept and your initial order quantity.
Pricing: Request the cost per unit for each item at the quantities to be ordered.
Discount levels: Request any discounts for ordering quantities over MOQ.
Lead time: State target delivery time between your placing an order and the factory shipping it out to you.
Carton weight and dimensions: Request the size and weight of your finished order ready for shipping. You’ll use this if you arrange shipping via your carrier if needed.
Shipping: Ask who is arranging shipping? If your supplier is handling shipping, request the cost — your own carrier could be a better deal. If working with an overseas supplier, you need to choose air or ocean freight. If your products are small and light, air freight can be reasonable since it arrives fast — generally one to two weeks — and shipments clear through customs quickly. Ocean freight is more economical for large container-size orders, but takes months to arrive and clear through customs.
Payment terms: Outline payment terms, including deposits when the order is placed, design or tooling phase payments and release of the final payment upon receipt.
Samples: Ask what samples cost and if that cost will be deducted from your full order when placed. Offering to pay for samples, but asking for a discount off the full order, is a reasonable request — especially when dealing with overseas factories.
When you receive this information from each manufacturer on your shortlist, compare the deals and select one or two that stand out. Pricing, MOQ and lead times tend to be the most important elements for small businesses, but there are other negotiation points you can work to sweeten a so-so deal.
Lower price per unit: Manufacturers — especially overseas factories — are used to negotiating, so don’t be afraid to ask for a lower price. Generally, factories run on a 20% profit margin, so if you can get your per-unit price discounted by 5% to 8%, you’re doing well without offending the manufacturer.
Order quantity: If you think you have the consumer demand, ask about larger-quantity discounts.
Shorter lead time: Ask about faster lead times to differentiate deals.
Custom packaging: If you feel the cost is high but the manufacturer is not budging, ask about adding a custom label with your logo for no added charges.
Overage for replacements on defective units: Ask about the factory’s defect rate and if the manufacturer will add a 1% or 2% overage at no charge to cover any replacement needs.
Once you have final pricing from your negotiations with one or more of your potential manufacturers, you can run a quick profitability study. This can be a simple spreadsheet that details your per-unit cost, shipping averaged per-unit, target selling price and profits per supplier.
Use the target retail pricing from your product research to compare profitability between suppliers.
If your direct source product purchasing plan seems profitable, it’s time to decide how you’ll cover the cost of your order and meet the manufacturer’s payment terms. Some small businesses pay out-of-pocket or use a line of credit or other inventory financing options for large direct sourcing  purchases.
Startups and side-gig sellers often rely on personal funds or credit cards. A 0% credit card is a good option for financing your direct source products purchase with minimal interest, then pay it off using sales income over time.
Once you’ve settled on one or two potential suppliers, you can place your sample orders. Typically, you’ll want to order two to three samples to compare consistency in workmanship, but that standard can vary based on your needs.
You can order and pay for samples for standard goods from manufacturer product pages on marketplace sites like Alibaba and Globalsources. Again, requesting that these costs are discounted from your full order is common and most suppliers will honor this request.
Ordering samples with custom features or for completely made-to-order products require more upfront specifications and generally cost more than stock samples. You’ll need to work any design, setup and prototype cost details out in your negotiations.
After you’re satisfied with the sample quality and have an acceptable deal, you’re ready to place your order. If working through an online supplier marketplace, it’s best to place your order and pay via its online system to ensure it’s covered under buyer protections. If working directly with a factory, you’ll need to place your order via its preferred method.
Direct source products ordered via online marketplaces generally must be paid for at the time of order. However, most major supplier marketplaces hold these funds and allow you to release them upon receipt of acceptable goods.
If working with an independent supplier, you might pay a deposit, then the remainder upon receipt. These details should be clearly defined in your negotiations so there’s no confusion or delay over these details when your order is complete and ready to ship.
Once your order is placed, mark your calendar with expected production, shipping and delivery dates, and periodically check on its progress.
If all goes to plan, you’ll soon receive your direct source products. Upon arrival, confirm that the count matches your ordered quantity, and quality-check that the items match your specifications and any packaging and labeling requirements.
Once everything checks out, you can release your final payment per your payment terms. Now you’re ready to start selling your direct source products online!

A personal loan can help you finance a wide range of expenses, such as unexpected expenses, debt consolidation, or large purchases like a new appliance or vacation.
Applying for a personal loan may seem intimidating, but it's fairly straightforward. Let's walk through the key steps for how to apply for a personal loan as well as actions you can take ahead of time to make the process go more smoothly.
Most loan applications take only a few minutes to complete (and funding can arrive the next day—or sooner). But the process before you apply can take a little longer.
Assess your finances to figure out what you can afford before you apply for the loan. Review your income and expenses to understand your budget, or how much money you have coming in and going out each month. Can your budget handle another monthly payment? How much can you comfortably add?
Most lenders offer pre-qualification that allows you to view the loan terms you are likely to be approved for. To pre-qualify, you usually only have to enter a minimum amount of information: your personal identifying information, income or employment details, and desired loan amount. The lender will review your information and do a soft credit check, which unlike a hard inquiry when you officially apply, won't affect your credit. A soft credit check can give you a preliminary decision, but keep in mind it doesn't guarantee you'll get approved.
With the preparation out of the way, and your choice of lender set, you can apply.
After you submit the application, wait for the results, which may be within minutes or may arrive in a few days. You'll receive a decision faster if your application is complete and free of errors.
It can take several business days to get a personal loan. First, the lender will review and approve your application. You'll have to review and accept the loan agreement. After signing, you could receive your funds the next day or it may take several business days to receive your funds, depending on the lender.
Depending on the lender, you may have a limited time to cancel and return a personal loan with no interest or penalty. Otherwise, if your lender doesn't offer the option to return your loan, you can pay it off immediately, although you may be subject to interest and prepayment penalties.
The impact of paying off a personal loan on your credit score depends on the information in your credit history. Your credit score may drop after paying off a personal loan if you don't have any other open installment loans on your credit report because it will affect your credit mix.

Banks offer personal loans typically ranging from $1,000 to $100,000. These loans have low interest rates and can come with perks for existing customers. Though not all banks offer personal loans, those that do are a smart first stop for borrowers.
Getting a loan from a bank can seem overwhelming if you’ve never done it before. These five steps will guide you through the process.
Before applying for a bank loan, you’ll want to know whether you qualify. Most banks require applicants to have good to excellent credit (a 690 credit score or higher), though some banks may accept applicants with fair credit (a 630 to 689 credit score).
Banks may also evaluate your debt-to-income ratio and whether you have enough cash flow to take on new debt. Though most banks don’t disclose a maximum requirement, 36% or lower is generally considered a good DTI.
One of the best ways to check your eligibility is to pre-qualify with the bank. Pre-qualifying takes a few minutes and involves filling out a preliminary application to see what rate, loan amount and repayment term you may be eligible for. Pre-qualifying won’t hurt your credit score.
Not all banks offer this option, though. If your bank doesn’t, call customer service and ask about eligibility criteria. Try to get as much detail as you can, including any minimum credit score and income requirements.
Some banks only lend to current customers, by invitation only or require you to have an open checking account for a certain amount of time before you can apply for a personal loan.
Even if you have a bank in mind, it’s still important to compare loans from different lenders to ensure the one you choose best fits your needs.
The annual percentage rate, which includes interest and any fees, is the best way to compare a loan’s cost. Finding the lowest APR can mean significant savings.
For example, if one bank offers a $20,000, four-year loan at 12% APR, you’ll make monthly payments of $527 and pay $5,280 in interest. But if another lender offers the same loan at 10% APR, you’ll make monthly payments of $507 and pay $4,348 in interest.
Many banks list their APR ranges on their websites.
You may also want to pre-qualify with a few online lenders. Almost all online lenders will show you personalized rates and terms with a soft credit check, so you’ll have more options to consider with no risk to your credit score.
As you compare rates, determine also what repayment term and monthly payment best fit your budget. The longer your repayment term, the smaller your monthly payment, but the more you’ll pay on interest.
Use NerdWallet’s personal loan calculator to estimate your monthly payment by plugging in different loan amounts and terms.
Once you’ve checked eligibility, compared rates and selected the best option, it’s time to apply.
Some banks may require you to apply at a local branch if you’re a new customer, but most applications are online.
Personal details, including name, address, phone number, date of birth and Social Security number.
Loan details, including desired loan amount, loan purpose and repayment term.
Proof of employment and income.
Information about monthly expenses, including housing costs.
Once you submit the application, you’ll undergo a hard credit check, which temporarily lowers your credit score by a few points. Depending on the bank, you could hear whether you’re approved or denied within minutes, while some banks may take a few days.
Once approved for the loan, you’ll receive the loan agreement. Some banks may require you to sign the agreement at your local branch, but most will let you sign electronically.
Make sure to read the loan agreement carefully to confirm that the loan amount, repayment term, APR and monthly payment amount are correct.
Also pay close attention to any fees, including late payment fees.
Once you’ve signed the loan agreement, you should receive the funds in a lump sum within a week, though some banks promise same or next-day funding after you’re approved. You can have the funds directly deposited in your personal checking account or a check may be mailed to you.
Once you receive the money, make a plan to repay your loan. Most banks offer an automatic payment option, which could help you avoid late fees, and some banks will even discount your rate for opting in to autopay.

0.25,"Which should you use for everyday purchases, a debit or a credit card? You may not think that there is much of a difference between these two options but a closer examination reveals there are a number of advantages to using a credit card, especially when you're filling up your tank at the gas pump. Not only does using credit provide a greater sense of security from possible fraud, but most credit card companies also offer cardholders some sort of reward for using their cards for gas.
Some stations offer tiered pricing—one for cash and one for credit. In most cases, you'll get the cash rate if you use your debit card. These retailers generally charge their customers less (sometimes as much as a dime) if they pay for their gas with cash or a debit card. But to avoid any confusion, be sure to ask the attendant before you use your card to fill up.
While it may be more convenient to pay at the pump, the best way to avoid debit and credit card fraud may be to pay for your gas inside the gas station.
Credit cards allow you to purchase fuel (or other goods and services at gas stations) without having to worry about having to part ways with your money right away. This is true as long as you have the available balance on your credit line. Using a credit card gives you as many as 25 days until the balance is due.3 And you'll avoid interest charges if you pay off your balance every month. If you don't, you will incur interest and other fees (late fees if you don't pay on time), which can make that fill-up even more expensive.
Many credit card companies offer their cardholders more protection against identity theft than is available to debit cardholders.4 This alone is a strong vote in favor of using your credit card at the gas pump. Additionally, avoiding identity theft protection isn’t the only benefit. Some credit cards offer rewards in the form of airline miles, hotel points, or cash-back incentives.
The key is to use your credit card like a debit card and only charge what you can pay at the end of the month. You don’t want to be charged an extra 20% in interest to put gas in your car, but if you can’t pay off your balance each month, then you will incur interest at the annual percentage rate (APR) associated with your card.3 In the case of people who have problems controlling their spending, debit card purchases are a clear choice.
No matter what the reward, the key is that you’re gaining something in exchange for using a credit card.
Think about the many stories you’ve heard about data breaches and consumer fraud, then consider that gas stations are on the front line of this trend. The gas pump is one of the easiest places for fraudulent activity to occur against anyone using a card.
In addition to some of the rewards you can earn by using a credit card at the pump, there are a few particular cards that offer bonus points on gas purchases.
If you’re a frequent traveler who believes that earning travel rewards is essential, then consider using the Citi Premier Card for gas purchases.

Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money.
Whenever gas prices rise, you tend to look for ways to fill up your tank for less. But you may not realize you're spending more because of the payment method you use.
Gas stations are legally able to charge extra for using a credit card. A surcharge passed on to the customer allows them to recoup the fees that the Visa and Mastercard payment networks charge them for transactions. So, it can make more sense for customers to pay with cash instead — or at least be more thoughtful with their credit cards.
Here’s what you need to know about paying and saving money at the pump.
» MORE: Are credit card convenience fees legal?
In 2013, merchants reached a settlement with the Visa and Mastercard payment networks allowing all retailers, including gas stations, to assess a surcharge on customers who pay with credit.
However, if merchants choose to do so, they must follow a host of rules to stay compliant with the terms of the settlement. For example, they're required to notify consumers, both at the register and on the receipt, that they’re being charged for using credit.
Those rules can be cumbersome to follow. So instead of imposing a surcharge for using plastic, most gas stations offer a discount for using cash — usually 5 to 10 cents off per gallon.
As of 2022, 10 states prohibit retailers from passing credit card surcharges on to consumers: Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah.
It would be nice if consumers could get cash-payment discounts at every retailer, but that’s likely a pipe dream. Gas stations sell one primary product, so it’s easy for them to price their product differently based on the payment method. For a grocery store or big box store like Target, it would be nearly impossible to post two sets of prices for everything on their shelves.
By law, merchants cannot levy a surcharge on purchases made with debit or prepaid cards, with a few exceptions. When Visa bought the payment processing company Interlink, it agreed to let Arco and a handful of other gas stations continue assessing this fee.
If a gas station offers a discount to customers paying cash, and you don’t mind going to the ATM occasionally, then that's a no-brainer for getting a lower price. It may already be the norm if you don’t own or want a credit card or you prefer the cash envelope budgeting method.
NerdWallet recommends that you put almost every purchase on a credit card as long as you pay the bill on time and in full every month. But whether you'll save more at the pump using a credit card versus cash will come down to your card's rewards rate. For instance, if the card you plan to use earns just 1% back on all purchases, including gas, you may find that cash is more cost-effective. On the other hand, some cards are especially good for gas purchases as they get you up to 5% cash back at gas stations, easily beating the small discount you'd see when using cash.
Consider the two scenarios below. In both cases, let’s assume the price of gas is $4.50, but you get a 10-cent discount for paying with cash, making the price $4.40. Let’s also assume that you have a 16-gallon gas tank and you fill it up once a week. That's 192 gallons a quarter, so to make it simple, we'll round to 200 gallons.
If you own the Bank of America® Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card, you can get 1.5% cash back on all purchases with no cap.
If you paid with the Discover it® Cash Back: $4.50 x 200 = $900 - $45 cash back = $855.
Amount you would save by paying with the card: $25.
The rewards rate for some cash-back credit cards applies to gas station purchases beyond fuel, from snacks to gift cards. You probably won’t get a discount on these items if you pay with cash.
Co-branded gas cards have fallen out of favor with consumers and for good reason. Discounts are limited by the type of card you have. For example, if you have a Shell credit card, you have to get Shell gas to receive the lower price. Also, most co-branded gas cards discount fuel in cents per gallon rather than a percentage of the total spend. As such, the savings rate decreases as the price of gas increases.
In general, you’re better off getting a general rewards credit card that can be used for a variety of purchases.
Whether you want to pay less interest or earn more rewards, the right card's out there. Just answer a few questions and we'll narrow the search for you.

Rollover IRAs are also available to those who were covered by an employer plan in the past and want to move money out of their plan account into their own IRA. Under some circumstances, you can merge SEP IRAs and rollover IRAs, but it's important to know the tax consequences of doing so.
The unique aspects of a SEP IRA With most employer-sponsored retirement plans, there are limits to when you can take withdrawals from the plan account. You typically can't make withdrawals from a 401(k) plan or other similar account until you stop working for your employer, unless certain exceptions apply. Hardship withdrawals can be available in some cases for situations involving an immediate and heavy financial need, such as medical expenses, educational expenses, or the purchase of a principal residence. However, plans don't have to provide for hardship withdrawals and can limit permissible uses.
SEP IRA rules are different from most retirement plans in that the employer cannot prohibit distributions from a SEP IRA. Even if the employer adds matching contributions, the worker must have the right to take them out of the account at any time.
Merging retirement accounts The tax consequences of withdrawing money from a SEP IRA are the same as withdrawing from any other type of IRA. If you take money out of the account for your personal use, then the withdrawal will be added to your taxable income. If you do so before reaching age 59-1/2, then you'll be subject to a 10% penalty.
However, if you do a rollover or direct transfer of your SEP IRA to a rollover IRA, then there are no tax consequences. Because the money stayed in a tax-favored retirement account, the move isn't treated as a taxable event.
Some SEPs allow employees to transfer money from rollover IRAs into their SEP IRA account. In that situation, the same rules apply, and because the move again involves two IRAs, it isn't treated as a taxable distribution. Bear in mind that employers aren't required to allow employees to move rollover IRA money into a SEP IRA, so check first before you start the process.
In general, merging retirement accounts can be a smart move in order to consolidate your retirement savings and get access to the best investments possible. Being able to combine SEP IRA and rollover IRA funds can be a useful tool in simplifying your financial life.

Technically, the SEP IRA and the traditional IRA are the same type of account, for tax purposes. The only difference is that the SEP IRA is allowed to receive employer contributions while a traditional IRA only individual contributions. So you can combine the SEP IRA into the traditional IRA without any ramifications, except for who is allowed to contribute.5 When doing so, move the assets as a (non-reportable) trustee-to-trustee direct transfer. Converting to a Roth IRA can be a bit trickier.
At a minimum, you can combine the SEP and traditional IRA to reduce any administrative and trade-related fees that may be charged to the account.
There are two issues to consider. If you roll a SEP IRA into a traditional IRA, assuming you do it right, there are no taxes to pay and your money will continue to grow tax-deferred until you begin taking withdrawals.
If you decide to roll it into a Roth IRA, you will owe income tax on the amount rolled over. However, the money will then grow tax-exempt, as there will be no taxes to pay when you begin taking withdrawals.
Be sure to know ahead of time how much you will have to pay in taxes. Also, try to avoid using some of the rollover money to pay the tax, because, depending on your age, it could trigger an early withdrawal penalty.
It’s up to you to decide which option works best. If you are unsure, you may want to consult a financial planner.

If you’re looking to buy your first home and are saddled with student loan debt, you may have a decision to make. Should you use your resources to pay off your student loans more quickly, save up for a down payment on a home, or try to do both at the same time?
Deferment or forbearance of your student loans is generally a bad idea if you can avoid it. It may not hurt your credit rating, but interest will continue to accrue. Making regular payments keeps you on track to pay off your loans on time.
This includes car loans, credit cards, student loans, and any other type of debt you have. Include the remaining principal (balance), interest rate, and minimum monthly payment for each one.
Pay as much as possible on the loan with the highest interest rate. Pay at least the minimum due on all others. Once you have paid off the highest interest rate debt, roll that money into the next debt and continue the process until all is paid off. If you’re struggling to make payments, consider tabling the thought of owning a home for a little while (since even with down payment funds, lenders need to ensure you can repay your mortgage and other bills as well) and consider seeking debt relief.
Keep your down payment savings separate from your checking account to avoid spending it. Open a savings account that pays the highest rate (online banks tend to be the most competitive) or set up an investment account to increase your potential yield over time. Be aware, however, that investing is risky, and you could lose a good chunk of your money in a down market.
Consider refinancing or consolidating your student loans to lower payments or the interest rate. Find out if you are eligible to convert to an income-based repayment plan. Mortgage lenders will use your standard repayment plan to calculate your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, so lowering your payment may not help you qualify for a home loan; however, if you save money on your monthly payment, you can apply the difference to your down payment.
You should have an emergency fund of three to six months’ income and retirement savings to round out your financial picture. Each of these is a separate account. If your job offers a 401(k) or similar retirement plan, make sure you put enough in it to take advantage of any employer matching.
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans require only a 3.5% down payment but come at a higher interest rate and require mortgage insurance.3 If you qualify for a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan, these loans come with zero down payment requirements and other benefits for former military service members.4 Additionally, there are a number of low down payment programs available if you qualify. A Conventional 97 loan is another option. The 97 refers to the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, where you are able to borrow up to 97% of your home’s value.
Saving automatically, such as through direct deposit or automatic transfers from your checking account, can make saving for a down payment easier.
Use direct deposit or automatic transfer from your checking account to move a regular amount to savings. If you treat saving as an ongoing expense, you will be more likely to do it.
Work bonuses, holiday gift checks, rebates, and tax refunds can all go into savings. Avoid the temptation to spend that money, and you will realize your savings goal sooner.
Look for places to cut spending and divert that money into savings. Places to cut include entertainment, eating out, subscriptions, expensive vacations, and clothing. If you rent, consider moving back in with your parents (with their permission, of course)—offer to pay something for room and board.
Income from a part-time job that can be dedicated to savings will help you reach your goal quicker. You could also try asking for a raise at your current job or volunteering to work overtime.
To start saving toward a house, you have to commit to the process. If you need help, consider setting up an automatic transfer to regularly move money from your checking account to a dedicated savings account.
There are a variety of factors to consider when choosing between buying a house or paying off a student loan, and the correct decision will vary from person to person. To determine which might be right for you, consider your priorities, time frame, and financial situation.
You absolutely should pay off your student loans. In fact, you will likely save money in the long run by taking care of your student loan debt as quickly as possible. Consider refinancing or consolidating your student loans to secure a lower monthly payment and/or interest rate.
It’s often possible to save for a down payment on your first home while paying off your student loan debt—you may not have to choose between the two. Keep in mind that circumstances change, and what’s impossible now may be possible in a year or two. Reevaluate your situation as needed, and be prepared to alter your plans as necessary. But keep saving—and don’t lose sight of these two very worthy goals!

Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money.
You don’t have to choose whether to pay off student loans or buy a house. With the help of first-time home buyer programs, and if you’re able to build up enough emergency savings, you may be able to do both at the same time.
Here are three ways to decide if that’s possible for you.
For many student loan borrowers, the biggest hurdle to homebuying is coming up with a down payment. But many states offer first-time home buyer programs that will subsidize the down payment. Many lenders also offer mortgages that require far less than the traditional down payment of 20% of the home’s price.
Look into these options before despairing that it’s impossible to put tens of thousands of dollars down while paying off student loans. You may find it’s more feasible than you thought, especially when you choose a house you can afford.
At the same time, you’ll likely need to save more than you expected for items beyond the down payment. These include closing costs — which generally come to 2% to 5% of your home’s price — and home maintenance, furnishings and appliances. Plan to save 2% of your home's value per year for repairs and maintenance alone. Plus, you’ll need emergency savings left over to cover non-home expenses that might come up, like medical bills and car repairs.
Use a closing costs calculator to help you figure out how much extra to budget for. Add three months of your bare-bones expenses to that amount, and that’s how much you should plan to save in addition to the down payment.
If you feel defeated, try making a budget using the 50/30/20 plan, which encourages you to spend 50% of your income on necessities, 30% or less on wants and 20% or more on savings. That will give you a framework for saving and help you determine how long it will take.
To give yourself more flexibility to save, consider refinancing student loans, which could lower your interest rates and potentially your monthly payment. Refinancing turns multiple loans into one, at an interest rate based on your financial history. To qualify, you’ll need a credit score in the high 600s or above, solid income and a history of on-time debt payments.
Getting a lower monthly payment may mean stretching out the time it takes to pay off your loans, which could eat into your interest savings. Make sure you’re comfortable with that before refinancing in order to pay less per month.
» CALCULATE:  Should you refinance student loans?
If you can meet these goals while paying off loans, go for it. Buying a home while paying off student loans isn’t necessary, though. There’s nothing wrong with renting longer and taking more time to pay off debt. The decision, ultimately, depends on your personal homebuying timeline and how much you can save in advance.

0.25,"The extended job loss due to COVID-19 has left people scrambling to figure out how they're going to make ends meet until life returns to normal. The federal government has offered assistance in the form of stimulus checks and expanded unemployment, but that's not enough for everyone to cover their expenses. So some of those in need are turning toward their retirement savings.
The CARES Act has loosened restrictions on 401(k) loans and withdrawals, but you should still use these as a last resort. Taking money out of your retirement account, whether temporarily or permanently, can set you back and make saving enough for retirement an even bigger challenge. But if you've exhausted all your other options, using your 401(k) funds may be smarter than taking on debt. Here's what you need to know about 401(k) loans and withdrawals under the CARES Act to decide which is right for you.
401(k) loans existed before the pandemic, though not all plans allow them. Under the old rules, you could withdraw up to 50% of your vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less. The CARES Act doubled these limits, so you can now borrow up to the lesser of $100,000 or 100% of your vested balance.
Just like a regular loan, you pay back what you borrowed plus interest, but the advantage here is the interest goes toward your retirement, rather than lining a banker's pocket. You typically have up to five years to pay back what you borrow, and if you fail to do so, the outstanding amount is considered a distribution and taxed accordingly. You'll also have to pay an early withdrawal penalty if you're under 59 1/2. But if you put all the money back in time, you won't owe taxes on it until you withdraw the money in retirement.
Some 401(k)s still aren't allowing loans, even amid the pandemic, so you'll have to talk to your plan administrator to see if this is an option for you. A loan will give you more time to pay back the money you took out before you must pay taxes on it, but it may not be your most flexible option right now given the changes the CARES Act has made to 401(k) withdrawals.
A 401(k) withdrawal is where you take the money out of your account without any obligation to pay it back. Normally, you pay income taxes on your withdrawals in the year you make them, unless the money comes from a Roth 401(k), and you'll pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're under 59 1/2.
The CARES Act has done away with the early withdrawal penalty for withdrawals up to $100,000 during the pandemic and it enables you to spread your tax liability out over three years. So if you withdraw $9,000 from your 401(k), you can pay taxes on $3,000 this year, another $3,000 the next year, and the final $3,000 the year after, instead of having to pay taxes on all $9,000 this year. That can keep you from ending up with a tax bill that's a lot larger than you anticipated and it may also help to keep you in your current tax bracket, so you don't lose a larger percentage of your income to the government.
The new law also enables you to pay back any money you took out within three years, and if you do so, these contributions won't count toward your annual 401(k) contribution limit for the year. They'll be treated as rollovers. So if we use our example above, you'd be able to contribute an extra $9,000 over the next three years on top of the annual contribution limit to your 401(k) if you choose. But not all 401(k)s allow rollovers and in that case, you may not be able to put back what you borrowed.
If your plan does allow them, you can file amended tax returns for the previous years after you've put the borrowed money back and the federal government will reimburse you for the taxes you paid on your 401(k) withdrawal during those years.
401(k) withdrawals are usually worse than loans, but in the current climate, they're actually the better choice for most people. You have to start paying taxes on your distributions this year, but you can spread the tax liability out over three years, and you have the option to put back what you borrowed. If you're able to do that, you can request that the federal government reimburse you for the taxes you've already paid, and then it's sort of like taking out a loan.
Consider how much money you're making this year and which tax bracket you expect to fall into to decide if it makes more sense to pay your taxes all at once or to spread them out over three years. If you're earning a lot less than normal, you might be in a lower tax bracket than you're used to, even with your 401(k) withdrawal. In that case, it might be smarter to pay all of your taxes this year rather than spreading them out and potentially giving a larger percentage of that money back to the government in future years when your earnings are higher again.
A 401(k) loan may still be an option for you if your plan allows loans and you don't want to worry about any tax liability this year. But you're taking a bigger risk. If you're unable to pay your loan back within the five-year time frame, you'll owe taxes on the outstanding amount plus a 10% early withdrawal penalty. That could lead to a bigger tax bill and set your retirement savings back even further.
It's smart to compare both options, but a withdrawal may make the most sense in the current situation. Aim to pay the funds back once you return to work if you're able to so you can recoup what you paid in taxes and minimize the effect the withdrawal has upon the growth of your savings.

Is it ever okay to take from your 401(k) plan, either as a 401(k) loan or a hardship withdrawal? After all, your plan is a powerful retirement savings tool and should be carefully handled. The primary advantage of saving in a 401(k) is the ability to enjoy tax-deferred growth on your investments. When you’re setting aside cash for the long term, a hands-off approach is usually best. Nevertheless, there are some scenarios in which taking money out of your 401(k) can make sense.
For example, a loan is just that—a loan, not a distribution. You’re essentially paying back the money to yourself, which means you’re putting it back into your retirement account, and that’s a positive. Loans are usually repaid with interest, which can make up somewhat for the earnings you’re losing by not leaving the money in your plan.
You could use a 401(k) loan to consolidate high-interest debt if your credit doesn’t qualify you for a low rate on a personal loan or debt consolidation loan. Comparing how much you’re paying in interest on your credit cards or other debt to the interest rate your 401(k) plan administrator charges can help you decide which is the better deal.
Your 401(k) could also be a source of cash when you’re planning to buy a home. You could use the money to cover closing costs or hold it in your down-payment savings account for a few months before buying, so the funds are seasoned.
Using a 401(k) loan to invest may sound like a gamble, but it could be appropriate if certain conditions exist. Let’s say, for example, that you want to purchase a home as an investment property. You plan to renovate the home and flip it for a profit but need capital to make the purchase. If you’re confident that the project will yield a big enough return, you could use money from your 401(k) to buy it or pay for renovations, then use the proceeds from the sale to pay back what you borrowed.
If you’ve been saving steadily over the years and choosing solid investments, you may be ahead of schedule when it comes to meeting your retirement goal. If that’s the case, and your job is stable, taking a loan from your 401(k) may not be too detrimental to your retirement outlook. You could use the money for the purchase of a vacation home, for example—or, if you have a child in college, as a less expensive alternative to student loans.
Ideally, your 401(k) plan should have a steady stream of money going in rather than out. If you do decide to take a loan from your plan—or a financial need makes a hardship withdrawal a necessity—be sure you understand the potential tax consequences of doing so. If you are unsure of the consequences, you may want to consider seeking the advice of a qualified financial planner before deciding to take a hardship withdrawal or a loan from your 401(k).
Also, consider how taking that money out may affect the growth of your nest egg over the long term. Taking out a large withdrawal or loan may mean you’ll have to play catch up to reach your retirement savings goal.

0.25,"For only the 57th time in the more than 124-year history of the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 0.41%), changes are about to be made.
On Monday, Aug. 24, S&P Dow Jones Indices, which monitors the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones, announced that three current Dow components will get the boot before the market opens on Aug. 31, with three new companies taking their place.
The removal of Raytheon isn't a huge surprise after United Technologies merged with Raytheon earlier this year. The same could be said for Pfizer's dismissal after more than 16 years in the Dow. Rival Merck is similar, and having two pharmaceutical companies in the Dow always seemed a bit repetitive.
The real surprise here is that oil and gas giant ExxonMobil is being shown the door. ExxonMobil has been a Dow component since 1928, back when it was known as the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. Next to General Electric's roughly 110-year consecutive run in the Dow (which ended when General Electric was kicked out of the Dow in 2018), ExxonMobil's 91-year streak is the Dow's second-longest. And it's about to come to an unceremonious end.
The Dow Jones is gaining additional cloud-computing exposure next week. Image source: Getty Images.
Salesforce, the cloud-based customer relationship management solutions provider, will bring a cutting-edge look to the Dow while also beefing up its technology sector exposure. Meanwhile, biotechnology blue chip Amgen will presumably offer more growth potential than Pfizer.
Finally, diversified technologies company Honeywell returns to the Dow after previously getting replaced by Altria Group in September 2008. Prior to Honeywell's 2008 removal, it had been a fixture in the Dow since December 1925, when it was then known as Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation.
On the surface, there appear to be a number of reasons S&P Dow Jones Indices made these changes.
As noted, Pfizer and Merck were somewhat redundant Big Pharma entries, so one was bound to get the boot eventually. The addition of Amgen provides a mature company with a potentially more robust long-term growth rate relative to a pharmaceutical stalwart like Pfizer.
An argument could also be made that the addition of Salesforce adds cloud-computing exposure to the Dow beyond the exposure offered by IBM.
But these aren't the real reasons the S&P Dow Jones Indices is removing ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon. You see, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price-weighted index. This means that share price, not market cap, matters in calculating the indexes' point value. Thus, a $200 per share stock has twice the influence of a $100 stock, and four times the influence of a $50 stock, regardless of market cap.
ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon have respective share prices of $42.22, $38.84, and $61.88, as of the closing bell on Aug. 24. Using the current Dow divisor of approximately 0.147, every $1 in share price is ""worth"" approximately 6.78 Dow points. Adding up the share prices of ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon shows that they were only responsible for 969.21 Dow points on a combined basis.
Comparatively, the incoming Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell have respective share prices of $208.46, $235.57, and $159.37. Admittedly, these incoming stocks, along with the pending 4-for-1 split of Apple, will cause the Dow divisor to be adjusted in the coming days. But the fact is that these changes are about share price and a company's relative influence on the Dow, and probably little else.
The Dow Jones is undoubtedly rich with history, but it's an almost unusable index by today's standards given its many flaws.
As stated, it's a share-price-weighted index that doesn't pay any heed to market cap. This means investment bank Goldman Sachs and its $71 billion market cap (but $207.34 share price) has nearly five times the influence of networking giant Cisco Systems, which has a $42.18 share price, but over twice the market cap ($178 billion).
What's more, the Dow doesn't do a great job of representing the varied sectors of the U.S. economy. Unlike the broad-based S&P 500, you'll find no utilities or real estate representation in the Dow Jones. There soon will be just one energy stock, Chevron, to go along with only one materials company, Dow.
Lastly, because the Dow's divisor is dependent on share price, some of the largest companies in the world with very large share prices could never join the index. For example, Amazon and Alphabet, the parent company behind Google search and YouTube, are the respective third- and fourth-largest companies in the U.S. by market cap. But with shares prices that are north of $3,300 and approaching $1,600, Amazon and Alphabet have no chance of joining the Dow without enacting a stock split.

Since its inception in May 1896, the index has changed its components dozens of times. The first change occurred a mere three months after the index was founded.
GE, Exxon-Mobil, and Pfizer aren't the only famous names to be dropped from the Dow Index. Other U.S. household names have gotten the boot over the decades - and more are sure to face the same fate in the future. None of the original companies on the index remain.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA, or simply the ""Dow"") is an index consisting only of large, ""blue-chip"" companies that broadly represent the U.S. economy, and has historically included some of the biggest and most influential companies in the world.
As the economy changes over time, so does the composition of the index. A component of the Dow may be dropped when a company becomes less relevant to current trends of the economy, to be replaced by a new name that better reflects the shift.
When the DJIA index initially launched in 1896, it included only 12 companies. Those companies were primarily in the industrial sector, including railroads, cotton, gas, sugar, tobacco, and oil.
Due to its declining business, Bethlehem Steel was removed from the Dow in 1997 after a seven-decade run. The company declared bankruptcy in 2001, and its remaining assets were sold off in 2003.4 Those assets exist today as part of Mittal (MT).
The Travelers Companies joined the DJIA in 1997 as part of the biggest single update to the index, when four of the 30 components were changed. In 1998, Travelers merged with Citicorp, and the new combined entity named Citigroup (C) inherited Travelers' spot in the Dow.
While Pfizer may have seen a big boost due to its successful COVID19 vaccines, the company was dropped from the Dow in 2020. This was a surprising move for many, but the index also hosts Merck, which is a similar pharmaceutical company and the index did not need two a the time.
The Dow includes 30 large, blue-chip American stocks, but the methodology is largely subjective and does not follow a fixed, quantitative rule. The stocks that are included tend to be exemplars of important sectors of the U.S. economy, have a strong track record of growth, and be of interest to a large number of investors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average's components are selected by a committee, and the index itself is owned by S&P Global, which also runs the S&P 500 index.
Charles Dow was an American journalist who founded a financial news bureau, originally called Dow, Jones & Co., with a colleague, Edward Davis Jones in 1896. It was launched with 12 of the biggest and most influential corporations of the day. Each was a giant in its sector, and most reflected demand for the raw materials that fed the American economy, like coal, sugar, and oil.

0.25,"You can review your credit report practically as often as you want through next year.
The three major credit reporting agencies recently announced some great news for consumers. Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion will continue to offer free weekly credit reports through the end of 2023.
Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, consumers are legally entitled to a free annual credit report from each agency. However, you'd normally need to pay for additional reports. That makes it harder to stay up to date on your credit history without paying for credit reports, since a lot can happen in a year.
Starting in 2020 during the pandemic, the credit bureaus began offering free weekly credit reports. So far, this benefit has been extended several times, and it makes it easier than ever to stay on top of your credit.
To pull your free credit reports, go to AnnualCreditReport.com. This is the only site authorized by the federal government.
The verification process with each credit bureau is the part that can be a little tricky. You'll answer questions about information on your credit report, so you'll need to remember addresses where you've lived and accounts you've had. Note that there can be questions where ""None of the above"" is the correct answer. If a question is referring to an address or loan you can't remember at all, it could be because that information actually isn't on your credit report.
You'll receive your requested credit report immediately after the verification process. You can review it or save it, and then move on to the credit report from the next bureau.
It's important to review your credit reports with each bureau for multiple reasons. For one, it's a good way to spot warning signs of identity theft, like addresses or accounts you don't recognize. You can also confirm that each credit bureau has the correct information and there aren't any reporting errors. In a 2021 investigation, 34% of consumers found a credit report error, so they're more common than you might think.
If you don't catch an error, it could damage your credit score. That, in turn, can keep you from getting approved for the credit cards you want or result in higher interest rates than you should be paying on a loan.
Although you don't need to check your credit on a weekly basis, it's nice to have the option of pulling your credit reports frequently. A year between reports can be a long time to wait, especially for people who are working on their credit and want to keep a close eye on it. Hopefully, the credit bureaus will decide to make free weekly credit reports a permanent feature.
This isn’t your usual credit card. Our experts choose this card personally because of its higher-than-average 5% cash back rewards rate!
Plus, enjoy 0% intro APR for 15 months and you’ll earn even more with their limited-time cash back match offer!

Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money.
Federal law gives you free access to your credit reports from the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Using the government-mandated AnnualCreditReport.com website is the quickest way to get them, but you can also request them by phone or mail. Those reports — which previously had been limited to once a year — are permanently available weekly to help consumers manage their finances.
Your credit reports are a detailed record of your past use of credit — but they do not include your credit score. NerdWallet offers a free credit score and report, updated weekly using TransUnion data. Checking your score does not damage your credit.
Here’s how to use AnnualCreditReport.com.
First, make sure you’re on the right site: AnnualCreditReport.com. Some other sites have similar-sounding names.
You'll need your name, Social Security number, address and birthdate. This, along with other personal data, will be matched against files for identification.
You can order your reports from one, two or all three of the major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.
For each report request, you’ll be asked a few questions about your finances that presumably only you can answer — for instance, the approximate amount of your mortgage payment or who holds your auto loan and when you took it out.
Some consumers have reported difficulty using the site, particularly answering security questions about accounts that are several years old. If you can’t recall those details, you can request your reports by mail or phone; this process doesn’t require security questions.
You can save reports to your desktop or print them out so you’ll have access later.
Your report or reports should be sent within 15 business days.
You can also get your credit reports by calling 877-322-8228. Visually impaired consumers can also call this number to request audio, large-print or Braille reports.
Accounts that aren’t yours or you didn’t authorize.
Negative information that’s too old to be included. Most negative information, other than one type of bankruptcy, should be excluded after seven years.
These errors have the potential to hurt your credit score, says Chi Chi Wu, a senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center. You might see other types of errors, such as out-of-date employment information, she says, but those aren’t factored into your score.
If you find errors, dispute them. Typically, the fastest way to file a dispute is online, but you can also call the credit bureaus or send a credit dispute letter by mail. The credit bureaus will investigate and must remove information that they can’t verify.
Monitoring your scores and reports can tip you off to problems such as an overlooked payment or identity theft. It also lets you track progress on building your credit. NerdWallet offers both a free credit report summary and a free credit score, updated weekly.
AnnualCreditReport.com is authorized by federal law and safe to use — as long as you ensure you're on the correct site.
Double-check the URL when you type it, to be sure you have not made a typo. Some other sites have similar-sounding names, so check that the URL matches and the site looks as expected.
Be aware that your credit reports are free, but credit bureaus also use the AnnualCreditReport.com site to sell credit scores and promote paid services, such as credit monitoring. However, monitoring doesn’t keep your identity from being stolen; it just alerts you after the fact. For best protection, use a credit freeze.

Your creditors regularly report your account information, including payments, credit applications, the percentage of available credit you’re using and negative marks such as collections. The three bureaus build that data into the credit reports that you get from AnnualCreditReport.com.

0.247706422018349,"Almost every investor is tempted by the idea of accelerating their returns.
On average, the S&P 500 returns about 9% every year with the dividends reinvested. That's enough to build substantial wealth over a long period of time, and it's a relatively low-risk way of doing it. However, for investors willing to take on more risk, there are ways to increase your potential returns by adding leverage. One of the most popular ways of doing this is trading on margin.
The simple definition of margin is investing with money borrowed from your broker.
There are two primary types of brokerage accounts. In a cash account, you invest your own money. In a margin account, you can borrow from the brokerage based on how much you have invested. When you invest with a margin account, you're able to purchase stocks according to your ""buying power,"" which includes both your own cash and a loan against the money you have invested.
Buying stocks on margin is essentially borrowing money from your broker to buy securities. That leverages your potential returns, both for the good and the bad, and it's important for investors to understand the implications and potential consequences of using margin.
First, using margin means paying interest to your broker for the money you're borrowing. At Fidelity, for example, the interest rate you'll pay on margin balances up to $24,999 is 8.325%. When you compare that rate to the 9% to 10% potential annual return in stocks, you'll quickly recognize that you're taking the risk, but the broker is getting much of the rewards. Because of interest, when you use margin you have to worry about your net profit margin, or your profits after paying interest, which will be less than your investing gains.
Investors should also be aware that brokerage firms have initial margin requirements, or minimum margin requirements, requiring the investor to put a minimum amount in the account before they can borrow from the broker. At Fidelity, you must put in $2,000 to use margin. In order to buy an individual stock, the margin requirement is 50%, meaning if you want to buy $10,000 of a stock, you have to put in $5,000 in equity. There are also maintenance margin requirements of at least 25% equity, which would apply when account values fall, and that rate may be adjusted depending on how the account performs and broader market volatility.
Assume you have $1,000 in cash and want to buy $2,000 worth of a stock that trades at $10 a share. You can put up $1,000 of your own money, borrow $1,000 from your broker, buy 200 shares, and you'd own $2,000 worth of that stock. Your net account balance would still look like you have $1,000, but it would show up as $2,000 in stock and a $1,000 margin loan from your broker.
If the stock went up from $10 to $12, that's a 20% increase above your purchase price. At that point, your 200 shares would be worth $2,400, and your account balance would reflect a total value of $1,400 ($2,400 in stock, minus the $1,000 margin loan). That's a 40% increase to your account value on only a 20% increase in the stock price.
Of course, margin cuts both ways. Say that stock instead dropped 20%, from $10 to $8. At that point, your 200 shares would be worth $1,600, and your account balance would reflect a total value of $600 ($1,600 in stock, minus the $1,000 margin loan). That's a 40% decrease to your account value on only a 20% decrease in the stock price.
There's a bigger risk in margin trading than simply losing more money than you otherwise would have.
When you have a margin loan outstanding, your broker may issue something known as a margin call, particularly if the market moves against you. When you get a margin call, your broker can demand you pony up more cash or sell out positions you currently own in order to satisfy the call. If you can't cover the call, your broker will liquidate your positions to get it covered.
If your broker starts selling out your positions, that broker doesn't care about your tax situation, your view of the company's long-term prospects, or anything else other than satisfying the call. If the market really moves against you -- say the company whose stock you bought on margin declared bankruptcy and the stock became worth $0 -- you're still on the hook for your borrowed funds.
Short-term movements in the market are almost impossible to predict, and there's always the risk of a black swan event like the coronavirus pandemic crashing the market. While the upside of margin trading may seem appealing, the downside risk is much greater.
As an investor, you have no control over the timing of a margin call, and you can fall victim to one even if it's just from a short-term movement. Even if you still believe that a stock will recover, and it does, you could still be forced to liquidate, meaning you missed out on gains you would have gotten if you were using an ordinary cash account.
Additionally, the interest payments and maintenance requirements add other costs and risks. Especially for beginning investors, it's best to avoid trading on margin since it's not always clear how much you've borrowed from your brokerage and how much you have in equity, plus it's easy to think of all of your holdings as your money even if much of it is borrowed. Remember that it's beneficial to your broker for you to use a margin account since it's an easy way for them to make money, so it's in their interest to encourage you to do so.
The recent events with WallStreetBet stocks like GameStop (GME  -0.21%) offer the best argument for not using margins. It's easy to get sucked into such trades when the stock is skyrocketing, but GameStop just as quickly reversed, leaving thousands of traders facing a dreaded margin call.

There are some similarities between margin trading and short selling since both involve additional risks. However, the mechanics of short selling are much different from margin trading.
Short selling means borrowing shares from your brokerage with the intent of buying them back at a lower price. That strategy works when the share price falls, but it can easily backfire. If the stock goes up, you lose money, and, unlike owning a stock, your losses are theoretically unlimited.
In this sense, short selling is even riskier than margin trading because you can be on the hook for an unlimited amount of money. With margin trading, you're only at risk of losing what you've invested and borrowed. Like margin trading, short selling generally requires traders to put up collateral, and a short seller can also be subject to a margin call forcing them to close out their bet.
What margin trading does have in common with short selling is that it should only be considered by very experienced investors who fully recognize the risks. Even then, those investors who want to use them should carefully limit their total exposure so that, when the market moves against them, it doesn't jeopardize the rest of their financial position.
While margin trading can be advantageous at times, overall the risks of borrowing from your brokerage outweigh the benefits.

A margin account increases purchasing power and allows investors to use someone else's money to increase financial leverage. Margin trading offers greater profit potential than traditional trading but also greater risks.
Purchasing stocks on margin amplifies the effects of losses. Additionally, the broker may issue a margin call, which requires you to liquidate your position in a stock or front more capital to keep your investment.
Typically, when are investor buys a stock, cash is debited from their brokerage account to pay for the purchase. The cash amount secures 100% of the purchase amount of the stock based on the stock price and the number of shares purchased.
Margin trading involves borrowing money from a broker and using that money to purchase securities or equity shares. By taking out a loan, the investor can buy more shares than they would have otherwise been able to afford using only the cash in their account. In return, the investor must repay the loan plus the interest that the broker charges.
It is worth remembering that during the boom known as the ""Roaring Twenties"" just before the great Stock Market Crash of 1929, margin requirements were just 10%. That meant that the same $10,000 balance in the account could allow for the purchase of $100,000 worth of stocks.
When buying stocks on margin, whether there's a gain or loss on the investment, you're still required to pay back the margin loan to the broker.
Suppose you have $10,000 in your margin account but want to buy a stock that costs more than that. Due to the 50% initial margin requirement, you must have 50% in cash for a stock purchase. As a result, you can purchase up to $20,000 worth of stock, effectively doubling your purchasing power.
After you make the purchase, you own $20,000 in stock, owe the broker $10,000, and the value of the stock serves as collateral for the loan. Outlined below shows the scenario had the stock's price increased in value.
The balance of $20,000 (minus interest charges) means the investor earned a 100% gain on the initial $10,000 cash investment. Had you initially paid for the entire $20,000 with cash (no margin loan) and sold at $30,000, the gain would be only 50%. This scenario illustrates how using leverage by purchasing on margin can amplify gains.
Leverage can amplify losses in the same manner. Let's assume the same stock position but instead, the stock price declines.
After paying your broker the $10,000 owed for the loan, your cash balance is now $5,000. In other words, you lost 50% of the initial $10,000 cash investment. However, the stock's market value declined by only 25%, from $20,000 to $15,000.
Just as you doubled your gains in scenario one when the stock price increased, you doubled your losses in scenario two when the stock price declined.
By borrowing on margin, investors use leverage to increase their purchasing power and magnify gains. However, margin trading can also magnify losses if the stock or security declines in value.
Although investing has inherent risks associated with it that can include losing some or all of your initial investment, margin trading can exacerbate those risks.
This maintenance margin requirement can vary between brokers and be as high as 30% to 40%, depending on the type of securities being purchased. Although the maintenance margin of 25% is not risky in itself, it's when the securities decline in value to the extent the requirement is breached that investors can get into financial difficulty.
If the value of your stock decreases, causing your equity to fall below the 25% maintenance margin, you may receive a margin call. A margin call requires investors to increase the equity in the account by liquidating stock or depositing additional cash.
Returning to the example above, let's say that your broker's maintenance margin requirement is 40% versus the 25% FINRA requirement.
If you cannot or choose not to contribute more money to cover the margin call, your broker is entitled to sell your stock and does not need your consent.
Buying stocks on margin means investors are borrowing money from their broker to purchase stock shares. The margin loan increases buying power, allowing investors to buy more shares than they would have been able to, using only their cash balance.
To buy stocks on margin, a margin account must be opened and approval obtained for the loan. If the stock's price rises, the investor can sell the stock, repay the loan, and keep the profit. If the stock's price falls, the broker may issue a margin call, requiring more cash or selling the stock. The loan must be repaid regardless of whether the stock rises or falls.
Buying stocks on margin is not for beginner investors. It's important to understand the risks and that the margin loan doesn't exceed the investor's ability to repay the loan.

0.243243243243243,"Affordable housing continues to be one of the top issues for the U.S. housing market. Prior to the housing market boom of the last two years, there was an estimated shortage of seven million affordable homes. But with the last two years of record home price and rental growth, the gap in affordable housing supply has only widened.
Thankfully, there are ways to invest in affordable housing without compromising your bottom line. Here are 10 ways to invest in affordable housing and become a part of the solution.
We hear it over and over from investors, ""I wish I had bought Amazon or Netflix when they were first recommended by The Motley Fool. I'd be sitting on a gold mine!"" It's true, but we think these 5 other stocks are screaming buys. And you can buy them now for less than $49 a share! Click here to learn how you can grab a copy of ""5 Growth Stocks Under $49"" for FREE for a limited time only.
You don't have to own or rent real estate to participate in affordable housing. Thankfully, several real estate funds and private real estate investment trusts (REITs) focus on affordable housing.
The largest and most popular private REIT is Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT), managed by Blackstone Group (NYSE: BX), which has allocated $1 billion to affordable housing. Raymond James (NYSE: RJF) is another major contributor to this movement, having invested $13 billion to deliver 150,000 units across 48 states.
Many people aren't aware that the growing generation of people 65 and older is among the most cost-burdened when it comes to housing. Healthcare REITs can offer an array of senior housing solutions to help reduce the housing burden for seniors by adding inventory and delivering more affordable units to choose from.
Public REITs like Omega Healthcare (NYSE:OHI) largely serve Medicaid and Medicare patients in senior housing communities and skilled nursing facilities.
Mobile homes are a great alternative housing solution that can offer more affordable pricing for renters and homebuyers. Sun Communities (NYSE:SUI) -- the largest mobile home, RV, and marina resort operator in the U.S. -- is a great way to gain exposure to this industry.
The company offers homes for rent and sale with the option to purchase a home down the line, even if buyers start out as renters. Its rental units usually offer 25% more space for 50% of the cost of a traditional home rental, while its home prices are around 3 times less than the median home price.
Independence Realty Trust (NYSE:IRT) is one of the smaller multifamily REITs out there with a unique focus on Class B apartments in suburban markets surrounding major metros. These slightly older, more outdated buildings are rented for a fraction of the price of brand-new Class A apartments.
Fractional investing is another great option for those wanting to invest in a specific property or opportunity. Using a crowdfunding platform like Cadra or Crowdstreet, investors can pool funds to invest in a fraction of an affordable housing property.

If you actively own multi-unit rental properties, consider turning them into mixed-income properties where a portion of the rental units are for those who earn 30% or less than the area median income (AMI).
Studies have shown that mixed-income units can benefit the surrounding community, help raise the area's median income, and positively impact the building's lower- to middle-income earners.
Many people think they have to sacrifice their return to participate in affordable housing, but thanks to several local and federal programs, landlords can receive subsidies to offset the difference in earnings. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), for example, pays investors for developing or renting units to low-income households.
Investors can also rent to those participating in the Federal Section 8 voucher program. Through Section 8, the government helps subsidize the difference in market rent and what the tenant can pay, sending the landlord a check each month without reducing the rental amount charged.

Local tax credits and programs often can be used in conjunction with federal programs to help offset development costs or losses in revenue that may be incurred from having a mixed-income or low-income housing property. Check with your county's housing authority to see what programs might be available to you.
Incremental rental increases are a part of the business. You should adjust your rent not just to reflect changes in costs like rising property taxes or insurance but also to be closer in line with market rent.
However, dramatic jumps in rental rates, particularly for renewing tenants, make housing unaffordable and can contribute to higher rates of homelessness. The ideal range for annual rent increases is between 2% and 5%. However, if the rent has grown tremendously or high inflation has pushed your costs higher, you can adjust accordingly -- just try to stay below 10%.

People experiencing homelessness are often a focus in discussions of affordable housing, given that affordability is a key issue for those who are unhoused. HUD reports that, as of 2022, just under 600,000 people were unhoused, with about 28% of those experiencing homelessness being of a family with children.2 This was a slight increase over recent years, though the numbers for specific groups were higher, including those with disabilities who have experienced long-term homelessness, which grew 16% since 2020, and people in unsheltered settings.
Single people not part of family households make up the majority of the population experiencing homelessness, with about 40% of those experiencing homelessness outside urban areas.2 Demographic disparities remain pronounced among those who experience homelessness, with those who identify as Black, African American, African, Native American, and Pacific Islander disproportionately represented.
People with disabilities constitute another important group in the U.S. that often needs specialized housing considerations. Housing for individuals with disabilities usually prioritizes ease of access and mobility. This includes incorporating features such as wheelchair-accessible bathrooms, ramps as alternatives to stairs, and other modifications that facilitate independence and daily living. Ensuring these accommodations are close to public facilities and support services can also enhance quality of life.
The growing numbers of adult and nontraditional college and university students have increased the need for off-campus housing. Adult students with families need private housing close to campus. International students need housing that is available year-round because it is less expensive and more convenient than frequent international travel on holiday and summer breaks.
Military service members have housing options on and off their bases. On-base housing requires construction, property management, and grounds maintenance, while off-base housing requires additional location assistance, custom construction, and purchase financing.
Off-base housing must be close to the base and easy to move into and out of. Military housing investors should be familiar with federal contracting and the specific guidelines for each branch of service.
In many areas, young professionals starting their careers may find themselves priced out of the housing market, especially in major metropolitan areas, where market-rate housing is out of reach for those with entry-level salaries—and frequently for those making quite a bit more. Many young professionals are faced with paying down student loan debt, which can determine their ability to save for a down payment on a home or afford higher rents. Besides affordability, safety, proximity to public transportation, and community resources are important for young professionals when choosing where to live.
People and families experiencing homelessness, people with addictions, those in recovery, and those newly released from correctional facilities require forms of transitional housing. Some adults and children in state protective services and mental health programs require group homes and neighborhood-based housing.
Apartments and boardinghouses should be large enough to provide adequate facilities and privacy for residents, but they must also yield the security and accessibility levels appropriate for each group.
One way to combat pricing people out of affordable housing, a form of housing discrimination, is a community land trust. These are private, nonprofit organizations that own land on behalf of a community, promoting housing affordability and sustainable development and mitigating historical inequities in homeownership and building wealth.
Affordability is important to investors, among other reasons, since it helps determine three crucial details: profitability, marketability, and financing. Subsidized housing programs, such as Section 8, help lower-income families afford rent by paying a part of the market price for rental units. Investors in affordable housing should know the median income for their area to determine what type of return they might get when buying property and using it for affordable housing.
Several sources can be used to determine the median income. The U.S. Census Bureau compiles average incomes for states, counties, and cities. Real estate websites have this information for people interested in buying homes in particular regions.
To determine the prospective profitability of an investment, estimate your operating expenses. For rental units, start with the taxes and insurance you pay as the owner. Include any utilities, building, grounds maintenance costs, and transfer costs such as inspection, occupancy certification, registration, and other fees required by your county or municipality.
For units to sell, determine your financing costs, closing costs at acquisition and at the time of sale, material and labor costs for construction or rehabilitation, and transfer costs.
For both rental and sale units, determine your marketing and advertising costs. The best projects will flop if you cannot attract renters or buyers. Even simple advertising strategies cost money and time. Consider the costs of doing business that affect your bottom line.
Consider your cash flow. If you pay utilities, some programs allow additional amounts to be paid by the subsidizing authority to cover a part of tenant utilities.
Finally, look at your income tax situation. Depreciation will affect your tax liability and the actual cash flow or net profit.
The affordable housing investor must locate and modify units that meet guidelines for rental subsidies from local housing authorities if this assistance is part of your strategy for meeting your costs. For sellers, focus on minimizing construction and rehabilitation costs for units to be sold on the market.
Successful investors know when and how to move in the market. Don't forget to perform ongoing buy-sell-hold analysis on rental units. If labor, material, and financing costs are high, now may not be the time to buy more properties. If more renters are in your market, now may not be a profitable time to sell units, even if interest rates are low. If market rent and median income in your area are high, now may be the most profitable time to retain property for the monthly rental income it can generate.
Research financing alternatives available to investors in affordable housing. Read up on Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD Multifamily Financing. Work with a local banker and a commercial mortgage broker or consultant to identify lender programs and find private investors. Join local homebuilder, remodeling, and real estate investor associations. Become a member of the chamber of commerce and affiliate with economic development agencies. Use these relationships to identify public and private financing and operating partnerships.
Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal. If you think you've been discriminated against based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps you can take. One such step is to file a report to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or HUD.
Urban planning and zoning laws are crucial in affordable housing development. Changes that allow for higher density, mixed-use developments, and relaxed building restrictions can enable the construction of more affordable housing units. In contrast, strict zoning laws and limits on building heights or densities can hinder affordable housing development by increasing land and construction costs.
Public-private partnerships are important for developing affordable housing. These partnerships typically take shape between government entities and private developers or investors. Governments might offer incentives like tax breaks, land rights, or subsidies to private developers who agree to build affordable housing. In return, private industry partners can bring in investment capital and expertise, making it viable to develop and manage affordable housing projects in particular areas.
An affordable housing investor must be a landlord, an investor, and a business executive. As a landlord, incorporate the human element. Remember that you can create a market by helping families and your community. As an investor, create a blue-chip real estate portfolio. Have the best properties in the most desired areas at the best prices that turn the most profit.
As a business executive, create a brand, generate goodwill, and maximize the market value of your brand, not just on individual units. Remember that your activities also create job options for construction workers and real estate sales agents. Your marketing and property managing activities help attract workers to the labor force in your units' areas. Not only can you create personal profits, but you can also create economic opportunities for people and communities through affordable housing investment.

0.243243243243243,"Some will say that tiny homes are a fad, but the trend is still going strong. In fact, the market is set to grow by $3.57 billion between 2022 and 2026, according to a report by the Global Tiny Homes Market.
A survey by Angi's HomeAdvisor discovered that 86% of respondents would move into a tiny home. Not surprisingly, 56% cited affordability as the major proponent of living in a tiny home, though it bears noting that square foot for square foot, one can be more expensive than your regular-sized home.
HomeAdvisor says that while a tiny home can certainly cost far less overall to build than a typical home, they do run anywhere from $150 to $400 per square foot, while larger homes are usually around $100 to $200 per square foot. Still, even the most luxurious 400-square-foot tiny home at those costs would have a price tag of $160,000 -- far below the median price of $425,000 for existing homes as of April, per data from Realtor.com.
The tight housing market has made it difficult for some beginning real estate investors to break in without breaking the bank. Bidding wars are common, and now with higher mortgage rates, homeownership has gotten that much more expensive. But tiny homes are affordable enough to be paid for in cash or financed with a home equity loan, so it's entirely possible to add a brand-new property to your portfolio for the price of the very down payment you were looking to apply to an existing home.
If you've considered tiny homes as an investment, here are three ways that strategy could pay off in a big way.
Of respondents, 50% said they would add a tiny home to their property for the additional income, whether renting it out as an apartment or even as office space for a remote employee. For investors looking to expand their portfolios, this is a great option because they don't have to go through the trouble of buying an additional property or land. They will have to abide by zoning laws, of course, but in areas where it is permissible, accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are being hailed as a way to relieve the housing crunch in many markets.
For investors in the multifamily housing market, tiny homes represent a unique opportunity to turn an existing single-family home into a multifamily home. Depending on your local zoning laws, you can add a tiny home to your property as an in-law suite or a small apartment for adult children. There's a demand for this sort of setup: According to Pew Research Center, there are four times as many multigenerational households now than in the 1970s -- coincidentally, the time that the modern tiny home trend began.
While only around 30% of the HomeAdvisor survey respondents said they'd be willing to buy a tiny home, many more said they wouldn't mind living in one for a short time. If you're in the market to turn your tiny home into a short-term rental, you could have a nice income stream -- bonus points if your home is especially unique-looking or is in a desirable location.
Online vacation listing sites make it easy to market your unique listing; for example, visit the Airbnb website, and you'll find an entire category devoted to tiny homes. Some nightly rentals run less than $100 -- far less than a hotel room or a night's stay at a regular-sized vacation home -- but depending on how much you paid to construct the tiny home, you'll break even and start turning a profit much sooner than with a regular-sized vacation rental.
If you're looking to crack the vacation rental or multifamily market, a tiny home could be the right move. When used as a way to transform a single-family home into a multifamily home, you are looking at a tidy profit at resale, particularly as more and more homebuyers look to move in with older or younger generations of their family. However, it's rental investors who stand to make the most profit with tiny homes as vacation retreats or as income-producing ADUs, ideal for tenants looking to downsize and/or live simply.

Television shows like Tiny House Nation and Tiny House, Big Living have promoted downsizing as a lifestyle. Living in a smaller home may mean financial freedom from a hefty mortgage or sky-high rent for some tiny house dwellers, and for some, it is a way to live within a more eco-friendly home footprint.
There are several financial considerations in choosing a tiny house—one that's just 100 to 400 square feet all told—from the type of construction, amenities, financing the home, and how to buy the land it sits on.
The beginning of the tiny home trend is credited to Jay Shafer, who built his first tiny home in 1999 in Iowa.4 He later founded in 2003 one of the best-known purveyors of tiny houses, Tumbleweed Tiny House Company, based in Colorado Springs, CO.5 The company sells four tiny house models that it will build for you: the Elm, the Cypress, the Farallon, and the Roanoke.
Tiny Home Builders, founded by Dan Louche, who built his first tiny house in 2009, will also sell you plans for a tiny house.15 If you want something between total DIY and a finished product, the company will sell you a shell of a tiny house that includes the trailer, framing and sheathing, and Rain & Ice Shield wrap and metal roofing.
For a bit more money, your shell can include the windows, siding and trim, and electrical and plumbing rough-in. Both shells require you to finish the interior at an additional cost.
If your tiny house is on a trailer and local laws allow homeowners to park trailers on their property, you may be able to rent land from a traditional homeowner for a few hundred dollars a month. However, municipalities that allow homeowners to park trailers on their property don’t necessarily allow people to inhabit those trailers as a primary residence, so make sure to learn about the local laws before you park your house.
If frequent travel is part of your tiny house lifestyle, you may be able to park your house at various campsites, as long as you don’t stay longer than the maximum number of days a site allows. A trailer park or mobile home park might be another option, but height and other restrictions sometimes rule out this option. If you already own land that will legally and logistically accommodate your tiny house, your land costs will be zero.
As of late 2023, shortages in materials and equipment have caused a spike in prices for homebuilding and home design materials that is unlikely to subside before 2024, according to industry forecasts.21 If you are constructing a tiny home or any home, you may have longer wait times or have difficulty sourcing some materials.
Another alternative is a personal loan, but it will have a much higher interest rate than a traditional mortgage. If your tiny house is cheap enough, you might be able to charge it to one or more credit cards, but the interest payments will be expensive. No mortgage also means no mortgage-interest tax deduction, and a credit card or personal loan interest is not tax-deductible. Financing with a low-interest credit card could be complicated due to the high amount of credit you need to take out on one card.
If you have and will continue to own a traditional home, you could use a home equity loan or line of credit to finance your tiny house. It may be worth researching the best mortgage lenders to find the best deal, and the interest would be tax-deductible. However, you'd be putting your primary home up as collateral, meaning you could be foreclosed on if you cannot make the loan payments.
Heating and cooling bills will be significantly lower than for a traditional home since you're changing the temperature of a much smaller space. Consider the tiny home's insulation before you buy or build; a well-insulated home will be more comfortable and cost less to heat and cool. Electricity will also cost less since tiny homes don't have the space for tons of energy-hogging appliances.
You won't have the enormous property tax bills that come with traditional homeownership. Still, if you live in a state with personal property taxes, you'll likely pay an annual personal property tax on your tiny house as an RV or trailer. You may be able to deduct the personal property tax on your federal tax return if you itemize your deductions. But without the massive expense of mortgage interest, you might not have enough deductions to come out ahead from itemizing and end up taking the standard deduction.
A couple of other costs some tiny-home owners find themselves with are fines for violating local housing and zoning laws and monthly storage-space rental for excess personal belongings. Additionally, even if the house is smaller, it's no less essential to insure it. As such, it's worth considering one of the best tiny house insurance policies currently available.
Most tiny homes cost between $30,000 and $60,000, according to Rocket Mortgage, although prices can go as high as $150,000 depending on what amenities you want to include.3 You will also need to consider the costs of land and interest payments if you finance your tiny house with a loan.
You can build a tiny house by ordering a pre-cut kit, or by paying a company to construct one and deliver it to you. Naturally, this option is significantly more expensive. If you want to save on labor, you can even build one yourself—some companies offer blueprints and instructions for tiny houses, and some plans can be downloaded for free online.
There's much more to tiny house ownership than the potential to save lots of money. It's about simple living, freedom, environmental stewardship—and living life to the fullest following your value system. Living in a tiny house might give you more money to have life experiences or more time to enjoy non-work activities.
There are trade-offs when you move into a tiny house. These can include a lack of privacy if you have a large family, coping with property and housing laws designed for traditional homes, and handling friends and family members who might disapprove of your ""alternative"" lifestyle.
The financial considerations are just the beginning of deciding whether to become a tiny house owner. It's a more significant life decision than most moves to new housing and will require patience and downsizing from a more traditional-sized home. Experts recommend researching tiny house living before purchasing one.

0.241379310344828,"Historically, small employers have steered clear of offering 401(k) plans, seeing them as complicated to establish and costly to administer. The rules for running a plan properly are admittedly complex. But increasingly, 401(k) management companies are helping to make the task easier by providing plans geared to the little guys of the business world.
If you are a small business owner considering initiating a 401(k) plan for your employees (and yourself), here are ten of the top retirement plan providers. They not only offer affordable plans but can act as administrators and investment fiduciaries—relieving you of the headache-inducing homework that comes with any plan.
ADP's 401(k) plans offer investment options from more than 300 investment managers.1﻿ Three investment line-ups are available for participants, based on their familiarity with investing and financial assets.
Employees with existing 401(k) accounts have the option to transfer those plans into the new plan, and a mobile app lets employees check their retirement accounts from their smartphones and other devices.
Their plans include both traditional and Roth versions.4﻿ Investment choices can be objective-focused (preservation, balance, and growth) or individual mutual funds.
As a robo-adviser, Betterment addresses many of the cost issues associated with the administration and management of a company 401(k) plan by using proprietary algorithms. In addition, Betterment says it eliminates fee hiding by using exchange traded funds (ETFs).
Plans have no annual fees and participants get full access to all of Charles Schwab’s brokerage and banking services, including an interest-bearing, FDIC-insured savings account through Schwab Bank.
Automatic enrollment is available and employees can get help or use a self-directed brokerage account.
Edward Jones offers small employers a variety of options when it comes to investments in its 401(k) retirement plans.8﻿ They include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and government securities.
The company offers education and administrative support to both business owners and employees. After the plan is established, employees can review their accounts online or through mobile apps made available by Edward Jones.
Employee Fiduciary comes out of the gate offering to let business owners compare their current providers’ 401(k) fees to Employee Fiduciary fees. And indeed, Employee Fiduciary has very low fees. It costs just $500 to start a new plan or $1,000 to convert an old one.9﻿ Small employers pay $1,500 a year for up to 30 employees plus 0.08% of assets under management.
Despite its low fees, Employee Fiduciary offers all the services of a full-price provider: tax return forms, annual report summaries, and benefit statements.
Fidelity Investments has consultants to help business owners select a plan and then, once the plan is established, provides access for employees and owners via the internet.11﻿ The company also offers a mobile app that allows employees to monitor their individual accounts.
Employees can transfer old retirement accounts into their new 401(k). Fidelity provides integration with payroll services, an advantage for small-business owners, as well as the full roster of services (plan administration, record-keeping, trading, and investment advisory).
Merrill Edge lists streamlining, convenience and affordability as key advantages to its small business 401(k) plan.12﻿ Also included are the usual benefits—tax deductions for the employer, investment fiduciary support, and educational support for employees.
With an annual asset-based fee of 0.52%, Merrill boasts pricing that is lower than many competitors.13﻿ Its plan includes online account management—a common feature in most 401(k) plans. An automatic enrollment option, as well as a Roth 401(k) option, are also available. Employers have the flexibility to contribute on a year-to-year basis.
Each plan has distinct matching, vesting, and profit-sharing options and once the plans are established, employees are able to transfer existing retirement accounts into their new 401(k) account. In addition, ShareBuilder retirement plans integrate with the majority of payroll providers.
Investment options include a range of T. Rowe Price and non-T. Rowe Price investments. There is a plan sponsor resource center as well as 24/7 website access for participants. Sponsors may select from more than 100 no-load mutual funds and common trusts as well as over 5,400 non-proprietary funds.
Of course, nothing replaces due diligence and good old-fashioned homework when it comes to checking out various 401(k) plan providers. Make sure you ask enough questions and more important, the right questions when considering a 401(k) plan for yourself and your employees.

Regardless of your business’s size, offering your employees a retirement savings plan is a crucial part of any HR operation. The key is to choose a 401(k) provider that is specially equipped to provide small businesses with quality retirement plans, investment advisory services and administrative support.
There are a few retirement plans available for self-employed and small businesses, including SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA and individual 401(k) plans, but traditional 401(k) plans are by far the most common option. Traditional 401(k) plans allow participants to make pre-tax contributions to an individual retirement account up to the limit set by the IRS. Employers can also choose to make contributions on behalf of their employees, match their employees’ contributions or both, also up to the IRS limit.
In this guide, we’ll go over seven of the best 401(k) providers for small businesses and walk you through how to go about choosing the best 401(k) provider for you and your employees.
You’ll first need to choose the firm that provides the type of retirement plan you really want to offer, whether that’s a traditional 401(k) plan or something else. Also take a look at the plan design to ensure that their eligibility requirements, vesting schedule, investment options and other details are appropriate for your employees. You’ll also need to evaluate the fees attached to your retirement plan. Often, fees vary depending on your business and the number of employees, so you will need to get in touch with each provider directly to receive a quote.
On a qualitative level, you’ll likely want to work with a 401(k) provider with excellent customer service, individualized investment and plan design guidance and a support team that’s easy to reach — especially because the landscape of retirement plans can be confusing to navigate, both for you and your employees.
Moreover, you should consider a provider that acts as a fiduciary advisor. Fiduciaries are legally and ethically bound to provide unbiased investment advice that aligns with their clients’ best interests. They also manage, monitor and adjust their clients’ retirement plans. There are several types of fiduciaries, but you’ll most often see the term 3(38) fiduciary.
Also note that a couple of the 401(k) providers in this round-up are online-based, which is a great option if you’re looking to really streamline and digitize this process. Certain providers can offer employer benefits beyond 401(k) plans, as well, which is a good option if you want to integrate all your fringe benefits under one provider.
Here are seven of the best and most reputable 401(k) providers for small businesses that you should consider in 2022.
ADP is one of the most respected names in payroll processing, but their comprehensive HR and employer services suite includes retirement plans and administration. While they can serve businesses of all sizes, ADP is unique in that they extend their full arsenal of services and decades’ worth of expertise to small businesses (which they define as businesses with one to 49 employees), in addition to large enterprises.
If you sign up for ADP’s retirement planning service, you’ll have access to a team of professionals who can help you browse, choose and customize which of their available retirement plans is best for you and your employees. In addition to 401(k) plans, ADP offers SIMPLE and SEP IRA options, which are great choices for very small businesses. They also offer tiered investment options, which are suitable for investors with all experience levels.
Once they’ve helped you design a retirement plan, your ADP advisors will help you implement and manage your plan to ensure you’re staying compliant. If you’re an ADP payroll client, your retirement plan’s record-keeping system will automatically integrate with your payroll system.
Betterment for Business is the 401(k) channel of Betterment, a robo-advisor that helps consumers make smarter investment choices using a combination of technology and human expertise. With this service, Betterment for Business’ human advisors and technology help business owners design 401(k) plans and advise employees on the smartest investments they can make in a variety of ETFs to optimize their retirement savings. Betterment for Business is a certified 3(38) fiduciary, so they’re legally and ethically required to act in your company’s best interests when giving investment advice.
Obviously, Betterment for Business is only a viable option if you and your employees are comfortable using a robo-advisor and managing your plan digitally. If you are interested, we’d recommend taking a look at our Betterment for Business review for a more in-depth understanding of this unique 401(k) provider.
Charles Schwab is one of the most established and best-known investment and retirement firms in the country — a better option if you consider yourself a bit too much of a technophobe to opt for a robo-advisor. Charles Schwab offers a managed account service that offers your employees personalized advice on a range of investment options, including ETFs or index mutual funds.
They’ll also provide ongoing account monitoring and automatic adjustments. As an alternative, Charles Schwab also offers SIMPLE and SEP IRA plans; or, if you’re self-employed, you can opt for their Individual 401(k) plan, which is essentially a traditional 401(k) plan designed particularly for individually owned businesses. It’s worth noting that this plan has no setup or monthly maintenance fees.
Sharebuilder 401k allows self-employed individuals and small businesses to buy and set up low-cost 401(k) plans completely online. They also act as 3(38) fiduciaries, so they’re certified to make investment advice, manage portfolios, and handle plan administration.
With Sharebuilder 401k, you’ll have four retirement plan options: Solo 401(k), Safe Harbor 401(k), Traditional 401(k) and Tiered Profit-Sharing 401(k). All plans require a one-time setup fee, a flat monthly administration fee and an annual fund fee that varies from 0.04% to 0.39% per year. Investment options include index ETFs and five types of model portfolios based on the individual investor’s risk tolerance.
Another trusted name in retirement services, Fidelity has over 30 years of experience and currently over 30 million plan participants under their belt. Fidelity can service businesses of all sizes, but they say that 86% of their business clients have fewer than 500 employees — so despite the big name, they’re fully equipped to serve small businesses.
Fidelity’s 401(k) plan offers a wide range of investment options, including over 16,000 mutual funds from 380 fund companies. They also offer comprehensive advisory services, as well as administrative, reporting and compliance support, and you can reach their advisors either in person, online or over the phone. Their advisors will help you design a plan or you can choose to work with your current broker. Plus, Fidelity has an app and online dashboard where you and your employees can view and manage their plans and get in touch with advisors whenever they need. Beyond retirement plans, Fidelity also offers integrated employer benefits, including payroll and health plans.
At 83 years old, T. Rowe Price is the most established asset management firm on this list. They offer four retirement plans for small businesses: SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA, Individual 401(k) and a 401(k) for Small Business. The former three plans are best for self-employed individuals or businesses with under 100 employees, while the latter plan is best suited for businesses with up to 1,000 employees.
Under the 401(k) for Small Business, plan sponsors can choose from over 100 no-load mutual funds and over 5,400 non-proprietary funds. T. Rowe Price also offers plan participants 24/7 phone support, plus an online portal where they can manage their plans and conduct transactions.
Under the Merrill Small Business 401(k) plan, independent advisors select and manage funds and model portfolios for all participants. Unlike the other participants on this list, pricing for this plan is very transparent: It costs a one-time setup fee of $390 and a monthly administration fee of $90. Then, each participant is responsible for a $4 monthly recordkeeping fee and an annual asset-based fee of 0.52%. You also have the option of converting your existing 401(k) plan to a Merrill Small Business 401(k), in which case you may end up saving money.
Merrill Edge’s Merril Small Business 401(k) is suitable for corporations, partnerships and nonprofits, but they also offer SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA and Individual 401(k) plans for sole proprietorships and self-employed individuals.

0.240641711229947,"In vitro fertilization (IVF) can be an expensive but necessary procedure for couples and individuals who may be experiencing struggles with fertility. While insurance may help with some of the costs, IVF is not covered by every insurer. Understanding what you might pay is an important step when preparing for IVF.
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine estimates the average cost of IVF at $12,400.1 However, pinning down the actual cost of IVF is difficult, as no two people have the same experience when seeking fertility treatment.
A single IVF cycle—defined as ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, and embryo transfer—can range from $15,000 to $30,000, says Dr. Jane L. Frederick, a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist with HRC Fertility in Newport Beach, Calif. Frederick says that what someone will pay largely depends on which treatment center they’re using and their medication needs.
Vitaliya Dovirak, director of finance at RMA Long Island IVF, says medication fees, which are payable to the pharmacy, can be anywhere from $3,000 to $6,000. Patients undergoing IVF treatment may also pay additional fees for genetic testing of embryos and diagnostic testing, all of which can add up to approximately $1,200 to $1,700.
Asking for a cost estimate before beginning IVF procedures can help you better understand the financial implications.
A number of factors can influence what someone might pay for IVF treatments. Main considerations include the facility with which you’re working, the type of IVF cycle you’re pursuing, and the number of cycles that are necessary to become pregnant. Using optional services can also increase the cost.
Here are some examples of how much you might pay for treatment at various facilities around the country.
As you can see, costs for IVF are not exactly uniform, though they may be in the same ballpark across different regions and clinics. Aside from where you seek services, your costs also can be affected if you use an egg or sperm donor or rely on a surrogate to carry the baby to term.
If you plan to undergo IVF, it’s important to consider the financial impact that it might have and what you might be responsible for paying out of pocket. Reviewing your insurance coverage is a good place to start.
Regardless of where you live, it’s important to check with your insurer to see what costs of IVF are covered and the coverage amounts. That can help you better estimate your out-of-pocket costs.
Dovirak recommends meeting with the treatment center’s financial services representative to discuss financing programs and options that may be available. These might include grants for IVF cycles, a bundled rate if you choose a freeze cycle with genetic testing, and embryo transfer or low-cost loan options through partner financing companies.
Finally, consider how much you might be willing to spend when there’s no guarantee of success. “There’s no way to know how IVF will go for you,” says Dr. Frederick. She advises talking to the clinic to ask for statistics based on your age and relevant medical factors to help you decide if IVF is right for you.
Insurance plans can cover in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other fertility treatments, though they’re not required to in all states. If your insurance plan offers partial or no coverage for IVF, you’ll need to consider whether you can pay for it out of pocket.
IVF loans can help you to pay for fertility treatments, and your clinic may offer them as one option for financial assistance. Whether it makes sense to take out an IVF loan can depend on your financial resources and budget. If you need to borrow a substantial amount of money, that could create a financial burden that might be difficult to handle on top of the considerable other costs of having a child. To find the right option, you should compare the best IVF loans available.
If the fertility clinic accepts credit cards as a form of payment, then you should be able to charge IVF treatments. That could get expensive, however, if you’re carrying a large balance at a high annual percentage rate. A low-interest-rate personal loan or line of credit might be a less expensive option if you need to borrow to pay for IVF.
Going through IVF can be mentally and emotionally trying, and adding financial worries into the mix can make it even more stressful. Breaking down your estimated costs before starting the process can help you to determine if IVF is realistic for your budget and how much you might pay to achieve your dream of parenthood. Talking to other parents who have been through the process can make it easier to understand what to expect, from both a physical and a financial perspective.

Updated on April 20, 2023 with the most recent information and statistics.
On average, a single cycle of in vitro fertilization, or IVF, costs between $10,000 and $15,000, according to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology. Some states require insurers to cover fertility treatments, including IVF, but most people pay significant sums out of pocket.
IVF is a process by which a human egg is fertilized outside the body and developed into an embryo before being transferred into a person’s uterus. The process involves medically induced ovulation, egg and sperm retrieval, fertilization and embryo transfer. IVF success rates vary depending on a number of factors, including age and health.
As a type of assisted reproductive technology, IVF can help infertile couples, same-sex couples or single people have children. IVF isn’t always necessary to treat infertility — most cases can be treated with medication or surgery, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
In 2020, almost 80,000 babies that were conceived using IVF or similar technology were born, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks IVF success rates.
The average cost of in vitro fertilization is $10,000 to $15,000 per cycle, according to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology. The exact price depends on each patient’s circumstances, including whether they have insurance coverage. Requiring donor eggs or sperm, or using a surrogate or gestational carrier, makes the process much more expensive.
A review of fee charts on several fertility clinic websites shows an IVF cycle generally involves paying a base fee plus additional fees for other services. Those services might include consultations, tests, medications and other procedures that occur throughout the process.
It can take multiple IVF cycles to successfully deliver a baby, which means the total amount you pay can multiply quickly.
For the most accurate estimate, review and compare prices at individual facilities. Many facilities include price information on their websites.
If you're wondering how to pay for IVF, there are financing options. Consider loans, including those facilitated between a lender and hospital, as well as more traditional loans. For those who qualify, there are also IVF grants offered through foundations, organizations and some treatment centers.
In most cases, IVF is not covered by insurance. It’s estimated that as many as 70% of U.S. patients don’t have their IVF treatments covered and have to pay out of pocket, according to IVF Options, a fertility clinic database and website.
Whether you have health insurance coverage for fertility treatments, including IVF, depends on where you live and your insurance plan. Lower-priced services, like testing, are more likely to be covered than more expensive services like IVF, according to a 2020 review of fertility services coverage and use in the United States by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Twenty states have laws mandating that fertility treatments be covered — sometimes fully, sometimes partially — by insurance, according to The National Infertility Association. Fourteen of those states require coverage of IVF treatments.
Even in states where insurance coverage is mandated, restrictions might force patients to pay for fertility services out of pocket. Some employers are exempt from state mandates based on their size or if they’re self-funded. It’s also common for states to limit eligibility for treatment, requiring couples to have a diagnosis of infertility or set caps that allow insurance companies to quit covering costs after a certain threshold.
So far, it doesn’t appear that state abortion bans affect procedures like IVF in those states. But reproductive health professionals and advocates remain concerned that current or future state laws could place restrictions on assisted reproductive technology because it involves human embryos.
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine analyzed 13 state laws that triggered abortion bans once Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. The ASRM found that the potential impact of state laws on procedures like IVF depends on how terms like “embryo,” “unborn child” or “fertilization” are defined.
Most of the state laws analyzed specifically refer to the treatment of embryos inside a pregnant person. However, Utah’s law is written broadly enough that it could apply to embryos created in a lab setting. IVF often leads to the creation of multiple embryos, some of which are not transferred into a patient’s uterus. Some of the remaining embryos are discarded or donated for research.
“One could argue that discarding an embryo or donating an embryo for research use is an intentional or attempted killing of a live unborn child and constitutes an abortion under [Utah’s] definition,” the report states.
The report also states that while abortion laws may not impact IVF yet, they open the door for additional legislation that could have a more direct effect.
“‘Fetal personhood’ legislation — which confers fetuses and embryos the same legal standing as a human being outside the womb — may become more common in the post-Roe world, exposing routine ART procedures such as IVF, preimplantation genetic testing, and the discarding of unused embryos to legal challenge and providers who practice them to potential liability,” the report states.

0.23826714801444,"Investors favor municipal bonds, or ""munis,"" for two main reasons. They are exempt from federal taxes, and they are relatively low-risk investments.
While stable, income-producing bonds warrant a position in any well-diversified portfolio, there are inherent drawbacks to owning munis. Individuals interested in purchasing them need to consider several factors before making muni bonds part of their investment strategy.
A municipal bond is a loan to a state or local government or an entity under its control. A government or agency might issue a bond to fund its routine expenses or to undertake a specific public project such as the construction of a bridge.
As with any bond, a muni is an investment in debt. The investor effectively lends a sum of money to a government or agency and is paid a regular stream of interest in return. At the end of a predetermined period of time, the investor's money is returned.
Many investors devote a portion of their overall holdings to bonds in order to offset the greater risks inherent in almost any other type of investment, notably stocks. That is the purpose of diversification: Low-risk investments cushion potential losses from higher-risk investments. Even bonds are not risk-free. The risk is that the issuer will default on its debts.
Investors can judge the risk level of a bond they are considering by checking the bond's rating. All bonds sold in the U.S. are rated by one of three bond-rating agencies: Moody's Investors Service, S&P Global, or Fitch Ratings. Bond ratings are based on an analysis of the creditworthiness of their issuers.
Use the tax-equivalent-yield formula to compare the real return on a muni bond with a corporate bond.
The formula is: Tax Equivalent Yield = Tax-Free Yield / (1 – Tax Rate).
Translation: That's the yield that the muni must have in addition to its federal tax-free status to be equal to the yield of a corporate bond.
Bonds used to fund local and state government projects like buildings and highways are afforded tax-exempt status at the federal level. Plus, people who purchase bonds issued by their states or localities may not be required to pay state or local taxes on the interest. That means some municipal bonds have tax-free status at all three levels of government.3 These tax advantages are offset by lower interest yields. Municipal bonds typically have lower coupon rates than similarly rated corporate issues with comparable maturities. Even if both bonds are investment grade, corporate bonds are generally considered higher risk. Investors are often offered higher yields for taking the risk.
So, when considering munis, investors should compare the yields of taxable investment-grade and government bonds by using the tax-equivalent-yield formula. Tax-equivalent yield (TEY) is the yield that a taxable bond must have to equal or exceed the tax-adjusted yield of a municipal bond. Tax Equivalent Yield = Tax-Free Yield/(1 – Tax Rate). In general, higher-income investors (with theoretically higher tax bills) are likely to benefit more from municipal bonds than individuals in other tax brackets.
The risks of default by governments that issue muni bonds in the U.S. are low. However, bonds by definition have interest rate risk, which is important to investors who want to sell their bonds on the secondary market.
Since 2013, annual inflation in the United States has ranged between a low of 0.7% (in 2015) to a high of 7% (in 2021). 2022 and 2023 also saw elevated inflation rates at 6.5% and 3.4% respectively. Otherwise, it was 2.3% or lower throughout that time.5 This means that a 20-year municipal bond that yields 2.5% to an investor in a 25% tax bracket, or a 3.3% tax-equivalent yield, would offer inflation-beating returns every year—right up until 2021, when it fails to get close to the rate of inflation.
Purchasing-power risk is the biggest potential drawback to investing money long-term in bonds. You'll get your money back in the end, but it may be worth less to you than it was. Investing solely in low-yielding municipal bonds is a safe approach but it could well mean giving up returns that exceed the rate of inflation and protect your purchasing power. A balance between municipal bonds and (relatively riskier) stocks can offset that risk.
Between 1970 and 2022, the cumulative 10-year default rate averaged over that time period was just 0.15%. This includes not only higher rated municipal bonds, but lower grade ones as well. This is why municipal bonds are classified as low-risk investments.
A bond that is issued with a callable option adds another risk to the investor. It means that the issuer can cancel the issue, pay off the principal and stop the interest payments. The issuer wants that option, in case interest rates drop substantially, giving it the opportunity to issue a new bond at a lower interest rate.
Most municipal bonds are callable. Their investors will get their money back, but they'll have to find a new way to invest that money. A new investment in bonds will earn them less.
The alternative minimum tax can be a tax trap for muni bond investors who have very high income from tax-shielded sources.
As noted above, tax-free muni bonds are not always entirely tax-free. Bonds are particularly attractive to older adults seeking a steady stream of income for their retirement needs.
An investor can buy and sell bonds directly through an online brokerage account. They also can be purchased through a full-service brokerage or a bank.
Another option is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or mutual fund that invests in muncipal bonds.
Despite the high rates of recent years, municipal bond rates have falling recently.
You also could lose money on muni bonds if you are forced to sell the bonds on the secondary market at the wrong time. The price you get will be determined by the total dollar amount of the remaining interest payments due, factoring in the prevailing rates available on new issues.
The best muni bonds from any issuer are rated AAA. They are issued by state and local governments nationwide and their bonds have been deemed AAA by one of the major rating agencies. When a government runs into economic trouble, its bond ratings suffer (but it also will pay a better interest rate in order to attract buyers).
A bond rated AAA or close to it is one of the best municipal bonds. A bond issued by a local government that is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy is one of the worst. Investors who don't care to keep an eye on the finances of state and local governments they invest in can invest in a bond mutual fund or ETF. It will be managed by someone who gets paid to pay attention to these things.
A municipal bond, or any bond for that matter, is safe as long as its issuer does not financially collapse. Luckily, that's highly unlikely in the U.S. bond market.
Municipal or corporate bonds are a great alternative for investors who want to create a reliable stream of income, particularly during their retirement years. Highly-rated bonds are by their nature very safe investments compared to almost any other alternative and especially compared to stocks.
Municipal bonds are, as advertised, free of federal taxes. That doesn't mean that the overall return on a muni bond will be the best available option for you. You still have to do your due diligence to choose the best municipal or corporate bonds for you or the best mix of the two. Another alternative is to invest in a bond ETF or mutual fund and let someone else make the choices.

Municipal bonds, often called ""munis,"" offer investors a way to generate tax-free income in the form of interest payments from state and local governments. Municipal bonds help finance projects such as roads, schools and other public works efforts.
Even though they don't typically post large returns, tax-free municipal bonds may be valuable to some investors. Higher earners may find them particularly useful as a relatively low-risk way to limit their state and federal tax liability, while people with more modest incomes might look for other investments that grow their overall wealth faster, even without the tax benefits.
Municipalities issue a bond when they need to raise money for a project. An investor buying a muni bond is funding that particular project over a set period of time. The investor expects to receive interest or coupon payments (usually semiannually) and the initial principal back when the bond matures, or when the loan term ends.
The capital market for muni bonds has grown over time. If you think they have a place in your portfolio, there are a few ways to get started. You can buy individual muni bonds or muni funds through an online broker, and many robo-advisors offer munis as part of their portfolio mix.
Individual bonds: Many investors purchasing muni bonds have a buy-and-hold strategy, intending to hang on to them until maturity. These investors can research and select bonds that work best for their portfolio in terms of risk and return, maturity date and tax benefits.
Municipal bond ladders: When you purchase an individual bond and hold it, you don't get your principal back until the bond matures. Some muni bonds mature in one to three years, while others mature in 20 or 30 years. Investors needing regular income might consider buying multiple bonds and building a ladder, with bonds maturing annually or in whatever time increment that fits their situation and cash flow needs.
Muni funds: For those who might not feel comfortable picking municipal bonds on their own, investing in munis through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, also known as ETFs, can make sense. One benefit is accessing a well-diversified portfolio of bonds from municipalities with different credit ratings, a range of projects and bond types, and varied risk and return. This lessens any potential default risk as you spread your dollars across many bonds.
Another benefit is shifting the onus to someone else well-versed in municipal bonds, namely the fund manager, to keep tabs on the municipalities and related risks for you.
Some investment management companies offer state-specific funds so investors can benefit from both federal tax exemption as well as state and local tax exemption. Even if you can’t find a state-specific muni fund that works for you, a national fund can provide federal tax exemption at a minimum.
There are two main types of muni bonds, and they differ by where they get the money to pay investors.
A general obligation bond, or GO bond, is typically backed by a municipality's local government, with an unconditional promise of repayment. It might pay its investors from a general fund or through a dedicated local tax.
A revenue bond uses the money generated by the project to fulfill its debt obligations. Examples include a bridge or tunnel that collects tolls or a stadium using ticket sales to pay interest and principal back to investors. Sometimes a municipality issues a revenue bond on behalf of a private entity, such as a university, housing developers or health systems. These are called conduit bonds. In these cases, the conduit borrower has the ultimate responsibility of covering the debt obligations.
As with any investment, it's important to weigh the pros and cons of municipal bonds before jumping in.
Tax minimization: Many municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes, and if the investor lives in the same state where the bond is issued, the muni will often be exempt from state and local taxes as well. This especially benefits investors in a higher tax bracket, as the tax exemption enhances the bond’s return.
For example, if an investor in the 35% tax bracket buys a tax-free muni bond yielding 4%, the calculation would go 4 / (1 - 0.35), and the bond’s TEY would be 6.15%. An investor would need to find a taxable bond yielding 6.15% to be comparable to this muni bond.
Being thoughtful about where they purchase tax-free muni bonds can save investors money. For example, many investors in higher tax brackets strategically buy tax-exempt munis in their brokerage accounts, which are taxable. They put their other less tax-advantaged fixed-income investments in retirement accounts like traditional IRAs and 401(k)s that are designed to defer taxes.
Diversification: When it comes to investing, it makes sense to not put all your eggs in one basket and instead diversify your holdings. This helps minimize investment risk across your portfolio. Investors often use muni bonds alongside Treasurys, corporate bonds and other fixed-income securities since they all have different risk and reward profiles. Usually, a muni bond carries slightly more risk and will have a higher yield than a Treasury, but is less risky and will have a lower yield than a corporate bond.
Safety: Municipal bonds are considered a relatively safe fixed-income investment. GO bonds are usually considered safer than revenue bonds, as a municipality can raise taxes to cover outstanding debt obligations, whereas revenue bonds are subject to the earnings made by that particular project. Revenue bonds also can be “nonrecourse,” meaning investors would be left high and dry if project revenues don’t meet expectations.
Default risk: While these bonds are a relatively safe investment, municipalities can sometimes find themselves in financial hot water. You might recall headlines about defaults in Detroit in 2014 and Puerto Rico in 2018.
Such defaults are rare, and you can combat default risk by researching the municipality and reviewing the credit rating for the bond you’re interested in. Credit rating companies such as Moody’s, S&P and Fitch assign ratings to help investors evaluate the riskiness of each bond. Additionally, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, a regulatory body, maintains a website with disclosure documents, pricing data and other information valuable for muni bond investors.
Interest rate risk: Similar to other fixed-income counterparts, muni bonds generally have an inverse relationship with interest rates. So if interest rates go up, bond prices come down, and vice versa. That's what we've seen in 2022 as bonds have entered a bear market, just like stocks.
If you purchase a bond and later interest rates rise — which is a strong possibility in the current economy — you are locked into receiving a return  that is less than what you would receive by buying a new bond at the higher interest rate. Thus, the price or market value of your bond falls as your bond is worth less. On the flip side, if you purchase a bond and later interest rates drop, the price of your bond rises since you’ve locked in a higher return than if you purchased a new bond at the lower interest rate.
Call risk: Some muni bonds are callable, which means the issuer can decide to repay the bond earlier than the maturity date. When interest rates fall, an issuer with the ability to call their bond may choose to do so because the issuer can save money by refinancing or reissuing another bond at a lower interest rate.

0.238095238095238,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), owned by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE 1.39%), announced that the staff of NYSE Regulation has suspended trading of Hertz Global Holdings (HTZG.Q). The NYSE will now file a delisting application with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Delisting is widely viewed as a negative development, and that is certainly true in Hertz's case. In fact, investors could argue this delisting should have taken place far sooner since traders had engaged in speculation with Hertz stock over the past few months, and in some cases the stock price jumped substantially. This speculation took place despite the overwhelming odds that Hertz shares in this form would end up worthless.
If you're asking yourself why Hertz has been delisted despite receiving approval for $1.65 billion in debtor-in-possession financing recently, it's because that funding was never going to fuel a rebound in a bankrupt company. Rather, it will simply enable Hertz to continue its operations as an ""essential"" business while bankruptcy negotiations are completed. The likely outcome of this process, despite many things being up in the air currently, is that Hertz will emerge as a restructured company trading under different shares, with the current shares ending up with little to no value for common shareholders.
For those traders who still own Hertz, nothing will directly change with the number of shares they own, but it will be much more difficult to research, purchase, or sell shares because they're no longer listed on the NYSE and will be traded over the counter.
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Hertz Global Holdings wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

0.232758620689655,"Over-the-counter (OTC) trades are financial transactions, usually the buying and selling of company stock, that do not happen on a centralized exchange.
Over-the-counter (OTC) refers to how stocks are traded when they are not listed on a formal exchange. Such trades might happen directly with the company owners, or might be done through a broker. In the United States, listed companies are bought and sold on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ). Companies not listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ can sell equity in their business over-the-counter. Other financial securities traded outside an exchange are also considered OTC — such as bonds, derivatives, currencies, and other complex instruments.
Facebook has been around since 2004. It spent its early years growing into what is now a technology giant. In 2012, the company decided to go public and sell shares of the company via the NASDAQ exchange. Although the initial public offering (IPO) didn’t happen until eight years after the company launched, that doesn’t mean you couldn’t own a piece of the company before then. If you wanted to buy into the fledgling company back in 2007, you would have needed to do it over-the-counter (OTC).
A car dealership is like an exchange. It’s a place people go when they are looking to buy. But it costs you something to use that system. Alternatively, you could hang a “for sale” sign in the window and give it a shot on your own. You don’t get the advantage of the system designed to bring buyers and sellers together. But you also don’t have to pay a listing fee or follow the rules of the exchange.
New customers need to sign up, get approved, and link their bank account. The cash value of the stock rewards may not be withdrawn for 30 days after the reward is claimed. Stock rewards not claimed within 60 days may expire. See full terms and conditions at rbnhd.co/freestock. Securities trading is offered through Robinhood Financial LLC.
There are two primary over-the-counter (OTC) equity quotation services. Companies and investors use these services to post offers to buy or sell equity through their brokers.
The OTC Markets Group is a private company that quotes OTC equities. It was originally formed in 1913 as the National Quotation Bureau, which periodically provided brokers with lists of equity shares and bonds available for purchase. The equity lists were printed on pink paper, while the bonds were on yellow. Since then, traders knew these lists of available OTC equity as “pink sheets,” which became the name of the company in 2000.
The company changed its name to OTC Markets Group in 2010 and now provides an electronic quotation platform for the broker-dealers in its network. There are currently three quotation levels. OTCQX is the highest tier, which is reserved for established companies and has substantial financial disclosure requirements. OTCQB is designed for smaller companies, but they must not be in bankruptcy. The Pink level is now an open market with no financial disclosure or reporting requirements.
The Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) is a quotation service hosted by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). FINRA is a not-for-profit, non-governmental regulatory body that was authorized by the legislation that created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The OTCBB is a place for broker-dealers to make offers to buy and sell equity of companies that report to the SEC, but are not listed on the stock exchange. Companies can be listed on both the OTCBB and the OTC Markets Group.
The market for over-the-counter (OTC) securities is much like any other product. An interested buyer seeks out the product and has a maximum price they are willing to pay. The owner of the product has a minimum amount they are willing to accept. If the buyer’s maximum price is above the seller’s minimum price, a transaction can occur.
The OTC quotation services continuously update what people say they are willing to pay (bid price) and what sellers are willing to accept (ask price). When there is a bid above an ask, market makers move in to coordinate the trade — They purchase the product from the seller, then turn around and sell it to the buyer.
Brokers often place a bid or ask price on behalf of their clients. Or, in some cases, the broker may also be an investment house that purchases and sells securities for themselves. In these cases, the company is called a broker-dealer.
Some broker-dealers also act as market makers, making purchases directly from sellers. Sometimes, an OTC transaction may occur without being posted by a quotation service. These so-called “gray market” transactions might happen through a broker with direct knowledge of a buyer and seller that may make a deal if they are connected. Or, an OTC transaction might happen directly between a business owner and an investor.
The most common way for retail customers to buy an over-the-counter (OTC) stock is to create an account with a broker. Many, but not all, brokerage firms that allow you to trade on the stock market also let you trade OTCs.
OTCs cannot be purchased directly from the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) or the OTC Markets Group. All transactions happen through market makers rather than individual investors.
With that said, it's important to keep in mind that all investments involve risk and investors should consider their investments objectives carefully before investing.
Yes. Companies that are not listed on an exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), are traded OTC. Often, the company is too small to be publicly traded. Sometimes, the company can’t afford the listing fee. But some of these small companies grow into large ones. When a company gets large enough and meets the listing requirements of the exchange, it can elect to “go public.” By making an Initial Public Offering (IPO), the company can move from the OTC market to Wall Street.
While many companies that trade OTC have share prices under $5 (called penny stocks), that’s not always the case. There are a variety of other reasons the company may not be able to meet the requirements of an exchange. The most common cause might be delinquent financial reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Or maybe the company was recently facing bankruptcy. In these circumstances, companies can get listed on one of the stock exchanges once they fix the problem.
Centralized stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ, have specific listing requirements and are strictly regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In contrast, over-the-counter (OTC) stocks trade between investors without strict disclosure requirements or direct government oversight.
To pass the earnings test, the company must show profits of at least $10 million over the last three fiscal years, with at least $2 million per year for the previous two years, and no net loss in any of the prior three years.
In addition to financial standards, a listed company has to meet certain governance requirements, provide audited financial records, and comply with SEC regulations.
OTC stocks do not have the same oversight and are therefore considered much riskier than publicly traded companies. Some OTC stocks do adhere to SEC regulations and are listed on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB). But many are purchased and sold on the open market with no control whatsoever.
Every investment comes with a certain degree of risk. Therefore, no investment is safe from the potential to lose some or all of its value. However, investors are better positioned to understand the risks they take when they have reliable information.
That is why companies listed on an exchange are required to provide a lot of details about their finances, activities, and management. This information must be audited and accurate, or else they can face criminal charges.
Securities traded on the over-the-counter market are not required to provide this level of data. Consequently, it may be much more challenging to understand the level of risk inherent in the investment. Additionally, companies trading OTC are typically at an earlier stage of the company’s lifecycle. Because they are not well established, there may be a higher chance of failure.
The over-the-counter (OTC) marketplace gives you access to owning part of a company before the rest of the world knows it exists. There are pros and cons associated with that.
By getting in on the ground floor, you can take a position in a company before it grows. Then, when the company emerges as the next big thing, you will already have multiplied your investment several times over. Just imagine buying Amazon for a few pennies a share when it was just an infant of a company. As the company grew, the value of your shares would have grown alongside the other owners.
Most of the companies that trade OTC are not on an exchange for a reason. Some are companies that will never turn into anything. Some might be horrible investments with no real chance of making you any money at all. And, it might be hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. You might not get accurate information from them, or you may get no financial statement at all.

A controller is an official who oversees a company’s accounting and financial information, prepares its financial statements and reports, and ensures that they comply with applicable laws and regulations.

This is because OTC stocks are, by definition, not listed on the exchange. Purchases of OTC securities are made through market makers who carry an inventory of stocks and bonds that they make available directly to buyers. Some online brokers allow OTC trades. Full-service brokers offline also can place orders for a client.
Tens of thousands of small and micro-capitalization companies are traded over-the-counter around the world.
Over-the-counter stocks don't trade on a regulated exchange such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ. In most cases, they're trading OTC because they don't meet the stringent listing requirements of the major stock exchanges.
Many companies that trade over the counter are seen as having great potential because they are developing a new product or technology, or conducting promising research and development.
Others trading OTC were listed on an exchange for some years, only to be later delisted. A stock may be automatically delisted if its price falls below $1 per share.12 If the company is still solvent, those shares need to trade somewhere.
Penny stocks have always had a loyal following among investors who like getting a large number of shares for a small amount of money. If the company turns out to be successful, the investor ends up making a bundle. If it doesn't, the loss is, hopefully, a small one.
Potential investors should be aware that these companies are not required to provide a lot of information about their finances, their business operations, or their products, as is required for companies listed on the regulated stock exchanges. It's important to take their statements with a grain of salt and do your own research.
The first step an investor must make before trading OTC securities is to open an account with a brokerage firm.
If you go with a real-world full-service brokerage, you can buy and sell OTC stocks. The broker will place the order with the market maker for the stock you want to buy or sell.
Bid and ask quotes can be monitored constantly through the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB).
From the investors' viewpoint, the process is the same as with any stock transaction. As usual, they can place limit or stop orders in order to implement price limits.
Both stocks and bonds can be traded over the counter.
Most common stocks with real potential are priced over $15 per share and are listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq. Stocks priced below $5, which trade over-the-counter, may have murkier financial outlooks and are generally speculative and very risky.
Most successful stocks, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), formerly Facebook, and Tesla (TSLA), all first listed their shares on the NYSE or Nasdaq with prices above $10.
Although short selling is allowed on securities traded over-the-counter, it is not without potential problems.
These stocks generally trade in low volumes. That makes them Illiquid. An investor trying to cover an unprofitable short position could get stuck.
OTC securities also have been the focus of pump and dump schemes. Con artists use social media and email to heavily promote a thinly-traded stock in which they have an interest. This can create a high spike in the price of the stock. The con artists grab their profits and everyone else loses money.
These schemes often use OTC stocks because they are relatively unknown and unmonitored compared to exchange-traded stocks.

0.230769230769231,"Set yourself up for success with your first credit card by following these tips.
Being approved for your first credit card is an exciting moment. It can also be a little bit scary. Because of all the horror stories people have about credit cards, you could be nervous that something similar will happen to you.
The good news is that whether you have a positive experience with credit cards is entirely in your control. If you understand how credit cards work and how to use yours correctly, it will pay off. You'll raise your credit score and eventually be able to earn rewards. To ensure you have a credit card success story and not a horror story, here's exactly what you should do after getting your first credit card.
Your credit card will arrive with instructions to get you started. These will include how to activate your card, unless it doesn't need to be activated to use it.
If you haven't done so already, set up an online account with your card issuer. This will allow you to manage your credit card online, which is the most convenient option. You'll be able to view your balance, your transaction history, and pay your bill quickly and easily.
You don't want to miss any credit card payments. The card issuer can charge a late fee as soon as you miss one, although most will waive your first late fee if you call and ask. When you're late by 30 days or more, it can also affect your credit score.
A simple way to never miss a payment is to use autopay. Keep in mind that you could still have payment issues if there's not enough money in your bank account for your credit card bill. Even when you set up autopay, review your bank account regularly to confirm that your credit card payment won't bounce.
Another option is to make a monthly payment reminder. You can do this with a calendar app on your phone or computer.
It's always best to avoid credit card interest. How can you do that? It's simple: Pay either your statement balance or current balance every month.
If you pay the full statement balance, then you won't be charged interest on your purchases. You can also pay the current balance. This balance simply includes the charges that posted to your account after the statement period closed, which means they're technically part of your next statement.
Your credit card has a credit limit, which is the maximum balance it can have. A credit limit of $500 means any transaction that would push your card over a $500 balance will be denied. The credit limit is listed on the letter you got with your card, but you can also find it in your online account.
Here's the tricky part: It's not good to use your entire credit limit. A big part of your credit score is determined by how much of your credit you use. This is called your credit utilization ratio.
You'll get the best results for your credit score when your credit utilization is 30% or less. If your credit card has a $500 limit, then you should try not to have a balance any higher than $150. Once you're at $150, wait until you've paid the bill before you use your card again.
One reason credit cards are so good for increasing your credit score is because they help you build your payment history. That's the most important factor in your credit score. When you pay your credit card bill, it gets reported as an on-time payment.
The only way this works is if you have a credit card bill to pay. For that, you need to use your credit card every month. It doesn't take much; even a single purchase means you'll have a credit card bill, and the payment you make will raise your credit score.
It's very important that you track your credit card spending. You could do this by logging in to your account and reviewing all your transactions every week or so. Or, an easier option is to use a budgeting app. There are several free options to choose from.
There are a couple reasons why tracking your spending is a must. The first is to check that you're not overspending. Make sure you stay under the spending limit you calculated earlier and that you're following your budget. The other reason is so you can spot any credit card fraud.
Your credit card may come with free credit score monitoring. If so, you should be able to access it through your online account. If not, there's no shortage of ways to get your credit score for free online. Either way, you should have a service you use to check your credit score.
These services typically provide tips on understanding your credit score and how to improve it. You can use that information to work toward good credit. And by monitoring your credit score, you'll know whether you're going in the right direction. Note that when you've just gotten your first credit card, it can take up to six months of use before there's enough data on you to calculate a credit score.
If you're responsible about how you use your first credit card, you'll avoid credit card debt and build a strong credit history. Before you know it, you'll be able to qualify for the best credit cards and take advantage of all the features they offer.
This credit card is not just good – it's so exceptional that our experts use it personally. It features a 0% intro APR for 15 months, a cash back rate of up to 5%, and all somehow for no annual fee!

This influences which products we write about and where and how the product appears on a page. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money.
You’ve jumped through all the hoops: the application, the seven- to 10-day wait, the activation. Now your very first credit card is safely tucked away in your wallet, waiting for its moment to shine.
Credit cards don’t just make it convenient to pay for things. They’re also a tool that can help you build a credit history and grow your credit scores — if you use them responsibly, that is. Why should you care about your credit scores? Because the higher they are, the more likely you are to qualify for loans, like a mortgage or car loan, with better terms and lower interest rates.
Even if you never plan to buy a home or finance a car, good or excellent credit (FICO scores of 690 or higher) can open doors. Many landlords check your credit when you apply to rent a home, and some employers do as well when you apply for a job. A good credit score may allow you to get a cell phone plan or access to utilities without having to make an initial deposit. And if you ever desire another credit card with an even more robust rewards program, good-to-excellent credit will help pave the way. Here’s how you can use your first credit card now so you can benefit later.
Establish a history of responsible credit card use by making a few manageable charges on your card each month, just to get used to using it. One easy way to do this is to have a small, recurring payment, like a subscription for a streaming service, charged to your card.
You may want to limit your credit card use at first, sticking to cash or a debit card for some expenses while you adjust, and then using your credit card for more transactions over time.
Once those credit card bills start rolling in every month, there’s one thing you absolutely must do: Pay at least the minimum amount due by the due date.
When you make a late payment, you may be charged a late fee, plus an interest payment on the unpaid balance. Late payments can also hurt your credit scores.
When you activate your first credit card and create your online account, you can set up free text or email alerts that will notify you a few days before your bill is due. Take it one step further by signing up for auto-payment so you never have to worry about a late payment again. Just be mindful of how much money is in your checking account each month so your auto-payment doesn’t result in overdraft fees.
Making the minimum payment will keep you in good standing with your card issuer, but racking up high-interest debt on the remaining balance can lock you into a never-ending cycle. The moment you make that minimum payment, you can make charges up to your credit card limit again during the next billing cycle, adding to the debt you accumulated previously.
As you get used to using your first credit card, try not to charge more than you can afford to pay back when your bill is due. Unexpected expenses may happen, and a credit card can help you pay for those things when you don’t have the cash on hand. But having an emergency savings fund available can make it possible to afford surprise bills without having to go into debt.
» MORE: What happens if you make only the minimum payment on your credit card?
Divide your existing credit card balance by your credit limit. Now multiply that number by 100. The result is your credit utilization ratio, a measure of how much of your total available credit you use and a major factor in the calculation of your credit scores.
NerdWallet recommends charging no more than 30% of your credit limit during each billing cycle (and even less if you can).
If you need a higher credit limit, call the credit card issuer and ask whether a credit limit increase is possible. Keep in mind, however, that such a request could trigger a hard pull on your credit report and a temporary dip in your credit scores. Check with the issuer before proceeding.
If you’d like to start earning better rewards, ask your issuer about a product change, which can allow you to upgrade to a different card in that issuer's family without a hard pull on your report or a change in your account number. This way, you don't lose your credit history with the card.
You can also simply keep your first credit card open and use it once in a while to keep it active, while opening a second card that better matches your needs.
Even if you use auto-pay, checking your credit card statements every month can help you quickly catch anything suspicious. By law, you’re only liable for up to $50 in fraudulent charges on a stolen card, and many issuers waive even that. If you notice any charges you didn’t make, report them so you can get your money back and be sent a new card with a different number.
Apps like NerdWallet’s provide an easy way to monitor your credit score for changes and get an explanation as to why those changes occurred. Another good habit is checking your credit report, which collects data that is used to calculate your score. You can get one free credit report per year from each of the three main credit bureaus at annualcreditreport.com. If you see anything unusual, report it to the credit bureau.
Here’s a trick for checking your report year-round: Instead of getting all three reports at once, download a different one every four months.
Whether you want to pay less interest or earn more rewards, the right card's out there. Just answer a few questions and we'll narrow the search for you.

0.228571428571429,"Low-cost index funds are pooled investments with low expense ratios or annual management fees. Investors who focus on minimizing their investing costs can generate vastly superior returns over time since money that would be lost to fees is compounding in your investment account.
Many investors prefer index funds -- which are a type of exchange-traded fund (ETF) -- over mutual funds because of their lower expense ratios and tax-efficient nature.
Index-tracking ETFs typically have low expense ratios because they are passively managed, which keeps operating expenses low. Passive investing strategies don't require any in-house stock analysis or active trading. Low-cost index funds can allow investors without high levels of risk tolerance to put their money to work in the stock market.
You can also choose to invest in several types of low-cost index funds to maximize your portfolio's diversification.
If you want to hold a single index fund ETF that invests in the total U.S. stock market and in the right proportions, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF is your best option. Holding shares in this fund makes owning other stocks or ETFs redundant unless you want to concentrate your portfolio's exposure in a particular market segment.
Holding shares in this fund means you'll hold large-, mid-, and small-cap companies proportional to the broader market -- and at a bargain-basement 0.03% expense ratio.
If you're using the wrong credit or debit card, it could be costing you serious money. Our experts love this top pick, which features a 0% intro APR for 15 months, an insane cash back rate of up to 5%, and all somehow for no annual fee. In fact, this card is so good that our experts use it personally. Click here to read our full review for free and apply in just 2 minutes.
For the set-it-and-forget-it investor, this investment strategy is very difficult to match from a time- and cost-efficiency perspective. Many fund management companies offer total market funds at similarly low costs.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF tracks the S&P 500. The benchmark index is weighted by market capitalization and includes 500 of the largest U.S. companies. The broad diversification of this fund is appealing to many investors.
The S&P 500 is ""self-cleansing,"" meaning that when a particular company no longer qualifies for inclusion in the index, it is replaced by a growing company that deserves to be included. The formulaic nature of the inclusion process ensures that only high-quality companies are listed by the S&P and invested in by S&P 500 index funds, like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.
The Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF invests in companies with mid-range market values, typically between $2 billion and $10 billion. The mid-cap market segment includes companies with established businesses and reliable revenue streams, many of which have yet to grow to their full potential.
The ETF tracks the CRSP U.S. Mid-Cap index by aiming to hold the same stocks in the same proportion as the index. The fund's small expense ratio of 0.04% is competitive among mid-cap ETFs.
The Vanguard Small-Cap ETF is an attractive option if you want to invest in companies with the most growth potential. The fund tracks the CRSP U.S. Small-Cap index, focusing on U.S. companies in the bottom 2% to 15% by market cap.
Investing in a low-cost, small-cap index fund ETF such as the Vanguard Small-Cap ETF can boost your overall returns. However, due to its small-cap focus, this ETF's performance can be more volatile than other investments.
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, global stock indexes were down anywhere from 30% to 50%, depending on the market segment. Since then, indexes such as the S&P 500 recovered quite nicely before again falling almost 25% in 2022 from the previous year.
If you have held low-cost index funds since then, there's a good chance you've seen your net worth expand despite recent poor performance -- especially if you've held on to experience the modest recovery in 2023. Critically, if you instead picked individual stocks and bought and sold at the wrong times, you would likely not have captured such efficient performance.
The beauty of an index-based investing style is that you only need to buy and hold -- and be unwaveringly patient. Paying very little for such a strategy is not only possible but also the best way to ensure that you keep the majority of your investment returns over the long haul.
Before you put down your hard-earned cash, consider your investment style.

Paying higher fees to invest in an actively managed fund erodes your ability to generate compound interest. While index funds are generally broad-based, you can gain additional portfolio exposure to particular market segments by allocating more money to specific stocks or funds in accordance with your investment preferences.
With so many low-cost index funds available, there's little reason to pay more than the bare minimum in fees. Adding a low-cost index fund to your portfolio keeps more of your hard-earned money in your own pocket.
A low-cost index fund is an ETF or mutual fund designed to track a certain benchmark index, such as the S&P 500. Because these simply track an index, they don't require professional investment managers and, therefore, have much lower costs than most actively managed mutual funds.
A low-cost index fund can help you invest your money in the stock market and pay minimal fees while doing so. Like any investment strategy, low-cost index funds aren't ideal for everyone, but they can be a great way to get exposure to the stock market without the risks and research involved with picking individual stocks.
The S&P 500 is a benchmark index and not something you can invest in directly. However, several low-cost index funds are designed to replicate the performance of the index over time by directly owning the stocks of the 500 companies comprising the index.
There are low-cost index funds that track various stock market indexes and indexes for commodities, bonds, foreign currencies, and more. Because of this, different index funds have different levels of volatility and safety and should be considered individually.
This top-rated card has one of the highest cash back rates we’ve seen (up to 5%), offers 0% interest on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months, and still sports a $0 annual fee.
Those are just some reasons why our experts signed up for this card after reviewing it. And remember: Credit cards protect against fraud better than debit cards and can help you raise your credit score when used properly.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are amazing investment tools that offer low management fees for the long-term investor while offering a wide array of investment themes for short-term investors looking to capitalize on trends and emerging growth opportunities.
If you’re not 100% confident in your stock trading abilities and lack full conviction in your positions, then your emotions could get in the way of your investments. If this describes you, then you’re much better off taking a passive approach to investing, which can be done through low-cost ETFs.
The seven ETFs covered below have some of the lowest expense ratios you will find throughout the entire ETF universe. While that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the best investment options at this point in time, they will definitely cost you the least as you continually improve your investment strategy.
All numbers below are as of December 15, 2021.
Unless you’re interested in waiting very patiently to take advantage of mispricings or you have a substantial amount of capital and want to implement a professional trading strategy to pick up small returns, this run-of-the-mill fund is only advantageous in a bear market.
This relatively new ETF launched in mid-summer 2015, yet while its five-year returns are promising, CIBR's return performed poorly in comparison to others in the technology category. The gamble is up to you: cybersecurity is going to continue to be important in the digital world, but will white-hat hackers continue to harness technology for good?
This ETF launched back in 2009. If you’re bullish, then it’s an option to consider, and the fund has considerably increased its volume in the past few years. This large blend ETF casts a wide net.
VTI has many of the same top holdings as SCHB and these two ETFs trade in tandem most of the time. But VTI offers a lot more liquidity and a slightly higher yield.
Trades along with SCHB and VTI despite a different design. It has many of the same top 10 holdings but VOO offers a high yield as well as plenty of liquidity.
This fund, while attractive in concept, has not historically provided strong returns unless investors are looking specifically to diversify outside of the U.S. Otherwise, if you’re going to invest in a developed market, it might as well be the U.S.
Many of IVV’s top holdings are the same as SCHB, VTI, and VOO. So, while IVV trades the same as those ETFs, you should look at other factors as well. The yield for IVV and the expense ratio are very comparable to the other ETFs. I'd call it a wash.
These are several high-quality ETFs that would be good options in a bull market. Whether you’re a bull or a bear, you should strongly consider putting some of these ETFs on your watch list for future consideration.
At the time this article was written, Dan Moskowitz did not have any positions in TFLO, CIBR, SCHB, VTI, VOO, SCHF, or IVV. He was long LABD.

In the financial world, advisors and planners are compensated in one of two basic ways: by earning flat fees or by earning commissions. A fee-only financial advisor is paid a set rate for the services they provide rather than getting paid by commission on the products they sell or trade.
Should you be working with a fee-only financial advisor? There are many benefits to someone who is compensated solely by what they charge directly to clients and not from the commissions earned from the sale of financial products or financial transactions. However, there are drawbacks as well. Let's review.
There has been some debate as to how ""fee-only"" compensation should be defined—mainly, whether or not it should include the second group, those who charge based on AUM. Generally, though, most agree, fee-only refers to payment from fixed, flat, hourly, or percentage-based fees.
One of the major benefits of selecting a fee-only advisor is the freedom from the inherent conflict of interest that can arise when a significant portion of the advisor’s income comes from selling financial products to you. The concern you should have as a potential client is whether or not the advisor is recommending a certain investment because it enhances their bottom line and if the products recommended are truly in your best interest.
In fact, there are some registered reps and others who earn all or part of their compensation via commission that may be required to favor products offered by their employer—which may or may not be the best investments for your portfolio strategy.
Since fee-only advisors do not sell commission-based products, receive referral fees, or collect other forms of compensation, the potential for conflicts of interest is limited. For this reason, many recommend that you only work with a fee-compensated advisor.
An advisor who only earns commissions—like a stockbroker—is held to a lower standard and does not have to make a ""best-interest"" recommendation, but rather one that is ""suitable"" for your needs.
Another benefit of using fee-only financial advisors is the opportunity for them to offer an objective second opinion of your situation. This is especially true if the advisor works with clients on an hourly, as-needed basis or perhaps will do a financial plan or financial review for a fixed project fee. Services here can range from addressing a specific financial question to a review of your investment portfolio or a full-blown financial plan.
All of the above are great reasons to use fee-only advisors, but there are still some potential downsides to the fee-only model.
First, fee-only advisors might be more expensive. For example, let's say through the planning process, a fee-only advisor discovers a need and recommends that a client buys a commission-based product such as disability income insurance. If the fee-only advisor doesn’t sell the product, then the client would need to find and work with an insurance broker, adding additional steps to an already complex process.
Also, the insurance broker receives a commission from the sale of the product, so the client ends up paying both a fee and a commission (albeit to different people).
Some states limit an advisor's ability to charge a fee for the analysis of just insurance products or needs.
Consequently, the fee-only advisor has to either limit the services they offer or charge clients a higher fee. For wealthy individuals who are willing and able to pay a substantial retainer, a fee-only advisor could be the right choice. But, for many individuals with limited resources or whose assets are tied up in qualified plans, the out-of-pocket costs for a fee-only advisor could get prohibitive.
Fee-only advisors can be expensive in another sense. Investors with smaller portfolio balances or lower transaction activity may get favorable pricing with commission-based advisors. While fee-only advisors are relatively less expensive for clients with large portfolios, different fee structures impact investors differently.
Fee-only advisors are also in the unique position of holding fiduciary responsibility over your assets, yet they do not get incrementally rewarded for your success. Whether your portfolio doubles in size or gets cut in half, a fixed-fee advisor will likely receive the same fees to manage your portfolio. As there is minimal incentive to the advisor to ensure your investment success, you may find fixed-fee advisors may not always have your best interest at heart as well.
Another issue to consider is that being fee-only does not ensure that the advisor is competent or appropriate for you. While it conjures up the image of an erudite professional, like a lawyer or an accountant, this compensation model doesn't guarantee the advisor has expertise—or that their expertise dovetails with your needs and profile.
For example, a fee-only advisor who specializes in working with teachers and government employees nearing retirement probably would not be the best advisor for a high-earning thirtysomething professional in the private sector.
The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) is one of the largest professional organizations of fee-only financial advisors in the country. It has a find an advisor link on its website. You can search by zip code and then further by area of specialization. Note that NAPFA members run the gamut from solo practitioners to large multi-advisor firms. Additionally, NAPFA members offer a wide range of service options, including hourly as-needed services, ongoing investment and portfolio advice, and almost everything in between.
The Garrett Planning Network is another organization of fee-only financial planners who mostly focus on providing hourly advice. There is a degree of overlap in the membership of the Garrett Planning Network and NAPFA. It also has a ""find an advisor"" function.
The accounting profession also has a financial planning designation for Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) called Personal Financial Specialists (PFS). Please note that while many holders of the PFS designation are fee-only, they are not required to be. As you contact advisors, you will need to ask these folks how they are compensated.
The Certified Financial Planner Board also has a directory of financial advisors who hold the CFP® designation. Again, being a CFP® does not mean the advisor is fee-only. The CFP® Board recently has revised its compensation classifications to include fee-only, fee-and-commission, and commission. There has been some controversy surrounding its definition of fee-only, so investors using this database need to ask and be diligent in investigating advisors found here to ensure they are fee-only. The CFP® Board hosts a 'Find a Financial Planner' tool on their website.
A fee-only financial advisor's costs can range greatly, depending on their expertise and years of experience, their region, and the services they offer. A flat fee of $1,500 to $3,000 is typical for the original creation of a comprehensive financial plan, according to financial advisors. Timed or retainer rates can run between $150 to $400 an hour and between $1,000 to $7,500 annually.
A commission-based financial advisor doesn't cost you anything—directly, that is. They get compensated by commissions from the products they sell to you or sell for you.
Typical commissions for investment products and packages range from 3-6% of the sale.5 That sum comes out of the amount that actually gets invested, so in a sense, that commission ""costs"" you in terms of future returns.
There's definitely overlap between the two. A financial planner is a professional who helps individuals identify and create a system/schedule to meet long-term financial and life goals. Some just advise, and others actually find investment products.
A financial advisor can apply to those who help you plan and also to those who manage the money in your portfolio and investment accounts. Financial advisors can include brokers and investment managers. ""Financial advisor"" is a broader, more generic term. All financial planners can be considered financial advisors, but not all financial advisors are financial planners.
Aside from asking around, you can zero in on a fee-only financial advisor by going to organizations that specialize in the same field. The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) and The Garrett Planning Network both have searchable directories on their websites.
Other, more general advisor organizations offer a good place to start. For example, the Financial Planning Association (FPA) has a database of financial planners that you can search according to location. On their website, you can easily filter the list to highlight fee-only planners—compensation is indicated in their profiles.
It is important to understand that the quality of the advice you receive is not solely tied to an advisor’s compensation model. However, the kind of advice you receive may be affected by the advisor’s compensation model. Compensation arising from sales commissions on financial products could cause advisors to recommend products mandated by their employer and/or products generating the highest commissions for the advisor. These products might not always be the best fit for your situation even if they meet the standard of suitability.
Critics of fee-only argue that this sort of arrangement tends to be more expensive. Of course, fees are an up-front expense—but make no mistake, the commissions paid to a financial advisor also come out of your pocket in the form of lower returns on your investment. Fee-only is not a perfect arrangement, but it is generally a bit more transparent and fees charged for advice are more visible. Commissions may be harder to ascertain.
Also, no advisor (or advisor group) can excel at everything. There are times when you may be better off working with an advisor who specializes in certain commission-based products such as a disability or health insurance. You may also want an advisor who is most current on all investment options. However, if you want advice on retirement planning and do not necessarily need to buy a specific product, an advisor who charges fees may be the right choice.

If you’re wrestling with a thorny money question or simply hoping to get your finances on track, hiring a financial planner sounds appealing. But searching for one can quickly get confusing.
You want a financial planner you can trust and who’s able to help with your specific situation — but also someone whose payment structure is easy to understand. That’s so you don’t get blindsided by a conflict of interest; for example, an advisor recommends an investment that costs you more because he gets a commission on it.
Focusing on finding a fee-only financial planner or advisor can make it all easier.
“In the fee-only model, the only person paying the advisor is you,” says Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit advocacy group. The advisor gets paid solely by clients instead of receiving commissions or other payments from an employer or product providers. That can help ensure you’re not dealing with “a salesperson masquerading as an advisor,” she says.
Fewer conflicts of interest. A fee-only advisor “won’t have an incentive to pitch certain products, because they’re working off of a fee versus getting a commission for promoting this fund or that annuity product,” says Charles Rotblut, vice president of the American Association of Individual Investors, a nonprofit group that aims to educate investors.
That said, it’s impossible to entirely eradicate conflicts. A fee-only planner who charges a certain percentage of your assets under management, for example, might suggest that you not withdraw money from those accounts to pay off your mortgage early.
Still, that conflict “can be clearly disclosed and easily understood,” Roper says. “But try explaining the conflicts associated with differential compensation or retroactive, ratcheted payout grids” — payment types associated with the broker-dealer business model.
“Pretty soon, the disclosures are going to run to several pages of incomprehensible jargon that the investor is unlikely to read, let alone understand,” she says.
Advice is the focus. When advisors are paid for advice, rather than selling financial products, they may be willing to spend more time offering it.
“From our experience, 80% of the time we spend with clients, for whom we do comprehensive planning, there’s no need for a product or even to discuss a product, only discussions about making good financial choices in life,” says Reed C. Fraasa, CFP and founder of Highland Financial Advisors in Wayne, New Jersey. Fraasa’s firm switched from fee-based to fee-only in 1998.
Clint Walkner, co-owner of Walkner Condon Financial Advisors in Madison, Wisconsin, says his firm made the switch to fee-only in 2017.
Variety of payment choices. Many fee-only advisors charge a percentage of the amount of money they manage for you; some may work only with clients who have about $250,000 or more to invest.
But there are also fee-only advisors who charge by the hour, have a flat fee for a service, or require a retainer. Some even use all of these approaches, choosing the best fee structure for the client.
Be sure to compare financial advisor costs and services before choosing one, and ask these 10 questions before you hire any advisor. Organizations that can help you search for a fee-only advisor in your area include the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, XY Planning Network and Garrett Planning Network.
If cost is a concern and you simply need investment guidance, you might be well-served by an online robo-advisor. These computer-based services are “available at a very low fee either with or without occasional access to a human advisor,” Roper says.
Whatever payment model your advisor uses, make sure she’s a fiduciary — that means she must act in your best interests. A nonfiduciary only has to help you in a way that’s considered “suitable” for your needs.
A fiduciary would be required to tell you about the Honda. A nonfiduciary? Not so much.

0.222222222222222,"“Shareholders” and “stakeholders” are two terms within project management that sound similar but have very different meanings. Many people even think they are interchangeable -- they’re not.
In this guide, we’ll uncover those differences and then discuss what can be done to counter negative stakeholder influence on your projects.
Stakeholders also include the community and society in general. So if you’re in the manufacturing business, for example, you have to consider the needs of neighboring communities -- specifically, how your operations affect their livelihood and quality of life.
A shareholder is an individual or organization that owns shares in a publicly-traded or privately held company and, therefore, has an interest in its profitability. Depending on the types of shares they own, they can receive dividends, vote on corporate policy or amendments, or elect a board of directors.
Although shareholders' decisions can influence the direction a company takes, such as in the case of mergers and acquisitions, shareholders are not responsible for the company’s debts.
To further underscore the differences between the two, let’s compare and contrast them more closely.
Shareholders own part of the business, determined by the number of shares they own. A majority shareholder is an individual or entity owning at least 50% of the company’s outstanding shares. Often, these are the company’s founders or the founders’ descendants.
Stakeholders don’t necessarily have shares in the business but have an interest -- a stake -- in it. Stakeholders sometimes also have shares in the company, as in the case of employee shareholders.
Shareholders focus mainly on the financial return on their investments, whether in the form of dividends or stock appreciation. Stakeholders focus on the company’s overall performance, how it treats customers, partners, and employees, and how it impacts the community, among other things.
Shareholders are free to do whatever they please with their shares of stock -- they can sell them and buy stocks from another company, even if it’s a competitor company. In other words, they may be financially invested in the company, but its overall success isn’t always a priority.
Stakeholders are usually in the game for the long haul and have the most desire for a company to succeed, not just in terms of stock performance.
The stakeholder group is a significantly broader category than shareholders. Shareholders are always stakeholders, but stakeholders aren’t necessarily shareholders.
Another important distinction -- only companies that issue shares have shareholders, while every organization, big or small, no matter the industry they operate in, have stakeholders.
There’s an age-old debate among business analysts -- some believe that corporations must focus on making more profits, while others think they’re bound by duty not only to their shareholders but also to their customers, suppliers, employees, and the community.
These two divergent paths are known as the shareholder and stakeholder theories.
Introduced by the economist Milton Friedman in the 1960s, the shareholder theory of capitalism claims that corporations’ primary focus is to create wealth for its shareholders. This, however, doesn’t mean that companies can do as they please because their practices are still subject to applicable laws.
The stakeholder theory was first introduced by Dr. R. Edward Freeman, a University of Virginia professor in business administration, via his 1984 book, Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach.
It’s a business ethics and organizational management theory that maintains that businesses, to be successful, must create value for all of its stakeholders, not just shareholders.
As far as the stakeholder theory is concerned, for organizations to truly create shareholder value, companies must embrace social responsibility and very carefully consider the needs of all of its stakeholders.
Identifying stakeholder expectations early on, ideally, right before you sit down with your team to write the project proposal, enables you to better assess how much influence each stakeholder group wields over the project.
You can then create a plan and project roadmap that specifically address various stakeholder requirements. Instead of backlash or opposition, you have a better chance of obtaining support for your projects this way.
In the end, you don’t want to spend time and resources on a project that’s likely to be shut down because of, say, environmentalists lobbying against it because of its potentially negative impact on the environment.
On the shareholder side of the equation, shareholders normally are not involved in the day-to-day operations of a company. But one thing’s certain: If there is a financial upside to it, they will want to see a project -- or any business activity -- succeed.
Stakeholder management is a process that happens throughout the duration of the project, not just in the beginning stages.
With project management software, you also have a central workspace for updates. Plus, built-in visual timeline tools such as Gantt charts make it easy to get everyone on the same page.
Both shareholders and stakeholders are vital to a company’s growth. Shareholders provide the funds that allow companies to invest and innovate, while stakeholders have a stake in the company’s long-term performance.
Although their primary motivations aren’t exactly aligned, the company’s success or failure affects both groups one way or the other.
Knowing the differences between the two helps you better understand their needs and expectations, which, ultimately, lets you devise ways to limit negative stakeholder influence on your projects and your company’s activities in general.

When it comes to investing in a corporation, there are shareholders and stakeholders. While they have similar-sounding names, their investment in a company is quite different.
Shareholders are always stakeholders in a corporation, but stakeholders are not always shareholders. A shareholder owns part of a public company through shares of stock, while a stakeholder has an interest in the performance of a company for reasons other than stock performance or appreciation. (They have a ""stake"" in its success or failure.) As a result, the stakeholder has a greater need for the company to succeed over the longer term.
A shareholder can be an individual, company, or institution that owns at least one share of a company and therefore has a financial interest in its profitability. A shareholder can also be known as a stockholder.
For example, a shareholder might be an individual investor who is hoping the stock price will increase because it is part of their retirement portfolio. Shareholders have the right to exercise a vote and to affect the management of a company. Shareholders are owners of the company, but they are not liable for the company’s debts.1 For private companies, sole proprietorships, and partnerships, the owners are liable for the company's debts.
A shareholder is interested in the success of a business because they want the greatest return possible on their investment. Stock prices and dividends go up when a company performs well and increases its value, which increases the value of stocks the shareholder owns.
The more stock a shareholder owns, the more they have invested in the company and the more stake they have in it. The votes of shareholders who own more stock have more weight within the company.
There are generally two different types of shareholders.
Stakeholder Theory is a recent theory of business that argues against the separation of economics and ethics. It states that short-term profits—prioritizing shareholders—should not be the primary objective of a business.
A shareholder can sell their stock and buy different stock; they do not have a long-term need for the company. Stakeholders, however, are bound to the company for a longer term and for reasons of greater need.
For example, if a company is performing poorly financially, the vendors in that company's supply chain might suffer if the company no longer uses their services. Similarly, employees of the company, who are stakeholders and rely on it for income, might lose their jobs.
Stakeholders and shareholders also may have competing interests depending on their relationship with the organization or company. For example, shareholders may want a company to maximize profits, which could be done by keeping wages low, reducing employees' hours so the company does not have to pay them benefits, or using less expensive manufacturing processes even if they pollute the local ecosystem. But these ways of increasing profits go directly against the interests of stakeholders such as employees and residents of the local community.
The emergence of corporate social responsibility (CSR), a self-regulating business model that helps a company be socially accountable to itself, its stakeholders, and the public, has encouraged companies to take the interests of all stakeholders into consideration. During their decision-making processes, for example, companies might consider their impact on the environment instead of making choices based solely upon the interests of shareholders. Under CSR governance, the general public is now considered an external stakeholder.
When a company's operations could increase environmental pollution or take away a green space within a community, for example, the public at large is affected. These decisions may increase shareholder profits, but stakeholders could be impacted negatively. Therefore, CSR encourages corporations to make choices that protect social welfare, often using methods that reach far beyond legal and regulatory requirements.
Employees are stakeholders in a business, since they are impacted by its decisions and actions. Some employees may also be shareholders if they own stock in the company that employs them.
A CEO is a stakeholder in the company that employs them, since they are affected by and have an interest in the actions of that company. Many CEOs of public companies are also shareholders, especially if stock options are a part of their compensation package. However, if a CEO does not own stock in the company that employs them, they are not a shareholder. A CEO may be an owner of a private company without being a shareholder (as there are no shares to buy).
A stakeholder is anyone who is impacted by a company or organization's decisions, regardless of whether they have ownership in that company. Shareholders are those who have partial ownership of a company because they have bought stock in it. All shareholders are stakeholders, but not all stakeholders are shareholders.
Both shareholders and stakeholders are important, but ethical business ownership and management recognizes that the short-term profit goals of shareholders may not always be in the best long-term interest of either the company or the community that it is a part of. Stakeholder Theory suggests that prioritizing the needs and interests of stakeholders over those of shareholders is more likely to lead to long-term success, health, and growth across a variety of metrics.

0.222222222222222,"If you're planning a home renovation project or considering debt consolidation, you may be in the market for a personal loan.
The best personal loans can be amazing financial tools. But if you're not careful, additional costs added on by lenders can catch you by surprise. One expense to watch out for is an origination fee.
Here, we'll break down what an origination fee is and discuss how you can avoid paying more than necessary.
An origination fee is an extra charge some lenders require borrowers to pay. The lender will probably explain that the origination fee covers their ""expenses,"" like processing your loan application, running a credit check, and helping you close on your unsecured loan.
Whether that answer is legitimate is a matter of debate. The fact that some personal loan lenders charge no origination fee, even while offering a lower interest rate, makes the fee feel more like an unnecessary expense than payment for services rendered.
Lenders typically charge the upfront fee by taking it out of the loan amount.
Let's say you borrow $20,000 and the lender charges a 3% origination fee. The lender would take their $600 ($20,000 x .03 = $600) origination fee from the top of your loan and disburse the rest to you. Because of the origination fee, $19,400 would be deposited into your bank account instead of $20,000. Still, you would pay interest on the entire $20,000.
Lenders who require a loan origination fee typically charge between 1% and 8%. On a $20,000 loan, that's between $200 and $1,600.
Due to interest, you actually end up paying more for the origination fee even though you never saw the funds. For example, if the origination fee on a $20,000 loan is 3% ($600) and the interest rate you pay on the entire loan amount is 8% for five years, you will pay a total of $4,332 in interest over the life of the loan. $136 of that total will be interest paid on the $600 origination fee, meaning the fee actually costs you $736.
No, not all lenders charge an origination fee. If you're a borrower with excellent credit, there's no reason to settle for a lender that charges an origination fee. Some personal loan lenders offer fee-free loans. That means no origination fee, no closing costs, no prepayment penalty -- no loan fees at all.
Negotiating loan fees is all about having leverage. When you don't need a loan, you have leverage. When you have an excellent credit score and any lender would be glad to have you as a customer, you have leverage. When you are willing to put up something valuable as collateral, you have leverage.
Not all lenders are willing to negotiate fees. If you don't try, though, you're potentially leaving money on the table.
Once you know that a lender wants you as a customer, it's time to announce that you would like to negotiate the origination fee. If the lender knows that you have excellent credit, they are far more likely to negotiate the fee.
Unsecured loan: An unsecured loan doesn't require collateral. It essentially counts on you to make your monthly payment as promised. If you fail to do so, the lender can sue you, but it can't repossess anything you own.
Secured loan: For this type of loan, you have to have something of value that can be used as collateral. It's the collateral that inspires a lender to take a chance on you -- even if you have bad credit. If you miss payments, the lender can repossess the collateral and sell it to get their money back. The property you offer as collateral must be equal to or greater than the value of the loan amount requested.
If the collateral is valuable enough, the lender may be agreeable to negotiating origination fees.
An excellent credit score can make it easier to negotiate an origination fee. If it's possible to postpone applying for a personal loan, you're likely to be money ahead by increasing your credit score before applying.
If you need the loan now, but your credit score is not quite up to snuff, don't worry. You can make this work. Look for personal loans for bad credit, and borrow only as much as you need.
Personal loans can help your credit score -- by giving you an opportunity to make on-time debt payments. Once your loan is paid off, your score will be higher, and you'll be in a better position to compare lenders.
An origination fee is not necessarily a bad thing and should be weighed against the rest of the loan offer.
In addition, some lenders offer perks, like allowing you to skip a payment after making 12 payments in a row. Before you decide on a particular lender, though, make a list of what each has to offer and compare them side by side.

A personal loan origination fee is an upfront fee a lender may charge to cover the cost of processing your personal loan. It might be called an underwriting, administrative or processing fee. Origination fees are also common on mortgages and federal student loans.
Compare origination fees between lenders and determine how they add to the overall cost of a personal loan.
Here’s more information on personal loan origination fees, what they cost and when it makes sense to pay the fee.
Personal loan origination fees typically range from 1% to 10% of the loan amount. Factors that determine the fee amount include your credit score, the loan amount, the repayment term and other information on your application, such as your income and whether you will have a co-signer.
The origination fee is accounted for in the loan’s annual percentage rate, or APR, which represents the true annual cost of borrowing when factoring in the interest rate and upfront fees.
Some lenders add the origination fee to the loan balance, but it's more common for a lender to deduct it from the loan.  Because an origination fee can reduce your loan balance, be sure the borrowed amount is still enough to cover your expense after the fee is applied.
Let’s say you need $20,000 to consolidate debt, and the loan you want has a 5% origination fee. If your lender deducts the origination fee from your loan proceeds, you'd have to request $21,053. Once the 5% fee is applied — in this case, $1,053 — you will have $20,000 to use for consolidation.
You would make payments on the $21,053 balance, not the $20,000 you'd receive.
Use a personal loan calculator to see the impact an origination fee would have on your loan.
An origination fee may not be a reason to decline a loan offer. In some cases, a loan with an origination fee may have a lower APR — and therefore cost less overall — than one without the fee.
Many lenders let you pre-qualify to check your potential loan amount, rate and repayment term, without affecting your credit score. Pre-qualify with multiple lenders to find the least expensive loan offer — even if that offer includes an origination fee.
Online lenders are more likely to charge the fee than banks and credit unions.
Though mortgage origination fees may be negotiable, this likely isn’t the case with personal loans.
Late fee: If you don’t make your loan payment on time, your lender can charge a late fee, though many offer a grace period (typically around 15 days) before charging it. Consider setting up automatic payments or due date reminders so you don’t forget to make your payment on time. A loan payment that’s more than 30 days late can negatively affect your credit score.
Non-sufficient funds fee: A lender may charge a non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee if your bank account balance is too low when the lender debits it. This is also known as a returned check fee. If you miss the due date because the lender couldn’t withdraw funds, you may have to pay a late fee in addition to the NSF fee.
Prepayment fee: Prepayment fees aren’t as common on personal loans as they are on other types of loans like mortgages, but it’s a good idea to read through your loan agreement to ensure you won’t be charged for paying off your loan early.

Tax deductions reduce the amount of earnings on which taxes are based (by reducing the value of these assets on a company's income statement), thus reducing the amount of taxes owed. The larger the depreciation expense, the lower the taxable income, and the lower a company's tax bill. The smaller the depreciation expense, the higher the taxable income and the higher the tax payments owed.
Indicated as depreciation expenses on a company's income statement, depreciation is recognized after all revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and operating expenses have been indicated, and before earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which is ultimately used to calculate a company's tax expense.
The total amount of depreciation expenses are recognized as accumulated depreciation on a company's balance sheet and is subtracted from the gross amount of fixed assets reported. The amount of accumulated depreciation increases over time, as monthly depreciation expenses are charged against a company's assets.
When the assets are eventually retired or sold, the accumulated depreciation amount on a company's balance sheet is reversed, removing the assets from its financial statements.
There are four methods used for calculating depreciation: Straight line basis (straight line depreciation), declining balance, units of production, and sum-of-the-years’ digits.
Each method recognizes depreciation expense differently, which changes the amount in which the depreciation expense reduces a company's taxable earnings—and therefore its taxes.
Straight-line basis, or straight-line depreciation, depreciates a fixed asset over its expected life. To use the straight-line method, taxpayers must know the cost of the asset being depreciated, its expected useful life, and its salvage value: the price an asset is expected to sell for at the end of its useful life.
For example, suppose company A buys a production machine for $50,000. The expected useful life is five years, and the salvage value is $5,000. The depreciation expense for the production machine is $9,000 per year (($50,000 - $5,000) ÷ 5).
The declining balance method applies a higher depreciation rate in the earlier years of the useful life of an asset. It requires that taxpayers know the cost of the asset, its expected useful life, its salvage value, and the rate of depreciation.
For example, suppose company B buys a fixed asset that has a useful life of three years. The cost of the fixed asset is $5,000, the rate of depreciation is 50%, and the salvage value is $1,000.
To find the depreciation value for the first year, use this formula: (net book value - salvage value) x (depreciation rate). The depreciation for year one is $2,000 ([$5000 - $1000] x 0.5). In year two, the depreciation is $1,000 ([$5000 - $2000 - $1000] x 0.5).
In the final year, the depreciation for the last year of the useful life is calculated with this formula: (net book value at the start of year three) - (estimated salvage value). In this case, the depreciation expense is $1,000 in the final year.
The units of production method assigns an equal expense rate to each unit produced. This method is most useful when an asset's value lies in the number of units it produces—or in how much it's used—rather than in its lifespan. The formula determines the expense for the accounting period multiplied by the number of units produced.
For example, suppose company B buys a fixed asset for $25,000. The salvage value is $500. It's estimated to produce 50,000 units over its life; it produced 5,000 units this year.
To find the depreciation value, use this formula: (asset cost - salvage value)/estimated units over asset's life x actual units made. The depreciation for the accounting period is $2,450 (($25,000 - 500)/50,000 x 5,000 = $2,450.
This method will produce results that vary annually depending on the number of units made.
The sum-of-the-years’ digits is an accelerated depreciation method where a percentage is found using the sum of the years of an asset’s useful life.
For example, company B buys a production machine for $10,000. It has a useful life of five years and a salvage value of $1,000. To calculate the depreciation value per year, first calculate the sum of the years' digits. In this case, it is 15 years or (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5). The depreciable amount is $9,000 ($10,000 - $1,000).
In the first year, the multiplier is 5 ÷ 15, since there are five years left in the useful life. In the second year, the multiplier is 4 ÷ 15; in the third year, the multiplier is 3 ÷ 15; and so on. The depreciation value is $3,000 ([$10,000 - $1,000] x [(5 ÷ 15]). Use this method up until the salvage value.
Depreciation reduces the value of assets, such as real estate and machinery, on a company's balance sheet. As a result, the amount of earnings on which taxes are based is reduced. While there are multiple accounting methods for determining depreciation, these methods are typically industry-specific. The four depreciation methods include straight-line, declining balance, sum-of-the-years' digits, and units of production.

It’s tax time, and as a small business owner you should be looking to take every single business deduction you’re entitled to. One deduction you may have forgotten about is depreciation: the continual decline in the value of property, which can be used to offset income from your business.
Depreciation can lead to valuable income tax deductions that save small business owners thousands of dollars each year. But figuring out exactly how to calculate and claim the deduction is where things can get a little confusing.
Depreciation allows small business owners to reduce the value of an asset over time, due to its age, wear and tear, or decay. It’s an annual income tax deduction that’s listed as an expense on an income statement; you take a depreciation deduction by filing Form 4562 with your tax return.
Depreciation is also the process by which a business writes off the cost of a capital asset. When you spend, say, $30,000 on an asset, you wouldn’t necessarily claim a $30,000 expense upfront; rather, you’d depreciate the asset over time, eventually claiming the full cost.
Assets that are typically depreciable include buildings, computers, equipment, machinery, office furniture and work vehicles, but you might also be able to depreciate intangible property such as patents or copyrights, according to the IRS. Property that cannot be depreciated includes land (since it does not get used up and it is not subject to wear and tear), inventory (since it is meant for sale), and leased property (since you don’t own it).
“Commonly, depreciation is taken against buildings owned by the business, equipment, and even smaller items like computers and cellphones,” says Jason Reiman, a financial planner and advisor based in Tucson, Arizona.
You use depreciation to decrease your tax burden, since you are lowering your overall taxable income. But it’s important to understand that depreciation does not affect your company’s cash flow or its actual cash balance, since it’s a non-cash expense.
For example, let’s say you own a restaurant that earns $100,000 in net income this year — the money you’ve made after accounting for all costs of operating your business, including operating expenses and investments — but you take total depreciation deductions of $25,000 on the building you own. The IRS would tax you on $75,000 of income instead of $100,000 because of the deduction. At a corporate tax rate of 35%, you’d save $8,750 on taxes.
We’ll start with a brief questionnaire to better understand the unique needs of your business.
Once we uncover your personalized matches, our team will consult you on the process moving forward.
Here comes the tricky part: figuring out how much of a depreciation deduction you can take on your assets.
In order to use depreciation as a deduction, you must be the owner of the property, and it must have a “useful life” of more than one year. The IRS requires that you write off the depreciation over the useful life of the asset. You can begin to depreciate the property once it’s in use, and you stop depreciating it when you’ve fully recovered its cost or you stop using it in your business.
Computers, office equipment, cars and trucks, and appliances can be written off up to five years; office furniture and fixtures such as desks can be written off over seven years; residential rental properties can be written off over 27.5 years; and commercial buildings or non-residential properties can be written off over 39 years, according to IRS Publication 946.
Straight-line method: You’ll depreciate the property an equal amount each year over its useful life. To come up with the annual amount you can depreciate, subtract the asset’s salvage value (the amount you could get by selling it at the end of its useful life) from its cost, and divide that figure by the number of years in its useful life.
For example, if you purchase a computer for $1,000 and it has a salvage value of $200 and a five-year life, you'd be able to deduct $160 in depreciation each year.
Accelerated method: With this method, you’ll be able to take larger depreciation deductions in the first few years of the property’s useful life, and smaller deductions later on. This is the method most commonly chosen by small businesses, according to TurboTax.
You’d use the IRS’s modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) and refer to the IRS’s percentage table guide in Publication 946, Appendix A to figure out your deductions.
Section 179 Deduction: This allows you to deduct the entire cost of the asset in the year it’s acquired, up to a maximum of $25,000 beginning in 2015.
Depreciation is something that should definitely be appreciated by small business owners. But since you’d rather spend time growing your small business than figuring out complicated tax rules, hiring a tax professional is likely a smart move.

0.21875,"Everyone has good and bad days at work, but when an employee has too many bad days, they may start strategizing to leave that job behind.
If you've worked hard to get the best possible people on your staff; the ones most desirable to your competitors; needless to say, you don't want to lose them due to situations you could prevent.
Here are eight reasons why employees quit their jobs. Take a hard look at whether your company is risking the loss of key staffers.
Family or other responsibilities can require flexibility that an employer is unable or unwilling to provide. In those cases, employees sometimes find it easier to quit than to rearrange their family obligations.
Good employees are often capable of doing more than they are initially tasked with, which can be a tricky problem. That level of capability can result in an employee being asked to do more work than they can handle, which can lead to long hours and frustration at contributing more than the rest of the team, which can eventually lead to burnout.
Alternatively, capable workers may complete their tasks and hit roadblocks when they request more work; the resulting boredom and lack of fulfillment on the job can be just as toxic as being overworked.
Many employees leave jobs when there is no upward mobility. No matter how hard they work or how well they succeed, there are no opportunities for advancement into higher-paying, more demanding positions.
Alternatively, if a less qualified or capable team member gets a promotion, high-performing employees may look elsewhere; especially if a former teammate becomes a manager.
Unfortunately, in many companies being a manager is considered a step on a typical career ladder, regardless of an employee’s skills. Managers require expert communication and interpersonal skills, yet not all managers have these skills or are given the training to gain them.
Micromanaging can lead to employees leaving. Capable employees prefer autonomy in completing their tasks and expect their managers to trust them to do so appropriately without constantly interfering.
Unclear communication of expectations from a manager can leave both employee and employer frustrated and unhappy in the work environment.
While the ideal workplace would include colleagues behaving professionally, not all personalities mesh so easily. Interpersonal conflicts, office gossip, recognition-grabbing, or undercutting of coworkers can lead to a toxic work environment, which might make a capable employee consider quitting.
An additional problem may be interoffice competition. Even when flexible hours and vacation time are generous, a competitive workplace might prevent employees from feeling like they can use their benefits or flexible work options without getting penalized. Having difficulty scheduling vacations or being discouraged from doing so can also lead to employee dissatisfaction.
Research has shown that taking full advantage of vacation time actually improves production, so encouraging a workplace culture where people can unplug and relax will benefit everyone.
If raises are miserly and recognition is rare, neither of these company attributes is going to foster company loyalty among employees or encourage them to put in extra hours over the weekend.
When employees do good work, they should be recognized financially and publicly, otherwise, they will leave to a place where they will be.
A generous benefits package can often be as much of a lure to employees as a generous salary. Funding for professional development or education, good health insurance, generous sick days, flexible hours, telecommuting options, more-than-the-minimum paid maternity and paternity leave, and ample vacation time are the kinds of benefits that can help a company retain workers or when they are not provided, drive an employee to look for a better package elsewhere.
Benefits don’t even have to be large to be appreciated; something as seemingly minor as snacks at meetings can make a big difference (“no meeting without eating” will keep blood sugar steady and employees happy). Planned social events can also go far to gain employee loyalty and forestall a toxic work environment.
If one career field is not fulfilling, it is now fairly common for workers of all ages to start new careers unrelated to the path they originally embarked on.
Talking with employees about ways in which they can stay in their job while continuing to learn and grow may help companies retain high-performing individuals.
While there are many reasons why an employee might quit, rewarding good work with appropriate pay, benefits, and recognition creates an environment that lets employees know they are valued.

Despite all of the other complex and nuanced parts of running a business, you may find that managing your employees is actually much more complicated than you would have originally thought. Employees have different personalities, goals and needs — and it’s not always easy to balance business human resources with your general operations. Taking this into consideration, there are common reasons why good employees quit.
Many of these reasons directly relate to the work environment that your business fosters and how you manage your employees as a leader. Although you may not always be able to prevent good employees from leaving, you can try to avoid these pitfalls and instead foster ways to put your employees — and your business — on the best track for success.
It may seem like a simple thing, but one reason why good employees quit is that they don’t feel like they’re respected or trusted at work. Whether they feel like they’re not respected by their boss or by their coworkers, these negative feelings can build up, eventually causing them to decide to leave. Employees may perceive this lack of respect in many ways — it could be the way that they’re spoken to, the kind of work they receive or the way their managers oversee their work.
As an example, employees who are micromanaged by their superiors often feel that they aren’t being trusted and given the authority to perform their duties autonomously. If employees feel particularly restricted or stressed in this manner, they’re not encouraged to do their best work and often seek an opportunity with a more conducive work environment for them.
To prevent this issue within your business, you should have an open and honest relationship with your employees. You should encourage them to work with you and ask questions, but ultimately trust that they have the skills, knowledge and responsibility to do the work you hired them to do. It may surprise you, but ultimately, your employees’ happiness can actually increase productivity.
Paying employees only the legal minimum, or below what they might make at other companies, could seem like a good idea on paper. Paying people less costs less money. However, low wages is another reason why good employees quit — and it could end up costing your business more in the long run. Although you may think that an employee’s salary is fair, you have to consider how it compares to industry standards. If your employee feels like they’re not being paid well for the work that they do, but they can find better pay for the same job elsewhere, they’re going to look for that higher-paid opportunity.
Even if an employee likes working for your business, sometimes money is key. Therefore, you’ll want to think carefully about how you pay your employees. Although it may seem like a weighty cost to increase an employee’s salary, it might actually cost you more if that employee leaves and you have to find and hire someone else.
You may think company culture is just another business buzzword, but in fact, it’s a large contributor to how employees feel about their jobs overall. If an employee feels connected to your business and engaged with the whole of your operations, not just their specific responsibilities, they’re more likely to stay at the job and produce the best work. Conversely, of course, poor company culture is another top reason why good employees leave. Poor company culture can consist of a range of issues — from unclear company values to a lack of transparency to simply not providing employees with the tools they need to do their job.
Therefore, it’s important to foster positive company culture, one with a clear mission, long-term plan, and encouragement and support for your employees. Creating a company culture doesn’t necessarily mean you have to tear down your office’s cubicles and start implementing hot-desking, it simply means developing a work environment to positively affect the way an employee learns, performs and interacts with others.
We’re all human and we only can give so much. Another reason why good employees quit, therefore, is they feel overworked. Employees may feel like they have too many responsibilities and they have to try and work behind their means to get everything done. Although in many organizations, especially small businesses, you may have to ask your employees to wear many hats, you should always be conscious of what employees have on their plate and how they’re handling their workload.
Ensuring that your employees aren’t overwhelmed may be as simple as meeting with them to discuss their work, help them prioritize their tasks and encourage them to talk to you when they have a problem. Similarly, feeling underappreciated is another factor as to why employees ultimately leave a job. It may seem like a small thing, but telling employees that they’re doing good work and recognizing their accomplishments goes a long way.
Unfortunately, having a bad manager can ruin a job for an employee. Many good employees quit their jobs, in fact, because of their manager and not because of the job itself. Whether the manager has little training, is overwhelmed themselves or simply has a different personality that clashes with the employee, a manager can often make or break an employee’s experience. To prevent this issue, manager training is essential. You want to make sure that your managers have the tools they need to work with and support their employees.
Additionally, you’ll want to make sure that when you hire a manager, that person is actually suited for managing and working with people. Although a senior employee with years of experience might seem like the right person to move into a manager role, not all people will be good managers — and some may not even want to manage. To keep your good employees from leaving your business, therefore, you’ll want to make sure you’re setting them up for success with a competent and experienced manager.
Even in a small business, employees need the opportunity to grow. It’s hard for anyone to be stuck in the same place for a long period of time — and this is another key reason why good employees quit. If an employee has been doing the same job for years without any opportunity for growth and change, they’re going to seek that growth and change at another organization. Although you may not always be able to offer your employee a clear path for career advancement in your company, there are other ways you can encourage their growth, both personally and professionally.
Some organizations offer fringe benefits like education stipends or hold office seminars for employees to gain knowledge on a particular subject or skill. Another significant action you can take is simply having an open conversation about your employee’s future. Ask them what they hope to be doing in five years: What are their goals? What would they like to learn? See how you can work together to promote their growth and let them know that you’re available for honest conversation regarding career progression.
If you have a business, you likely have a vision for it. The worst way to achieve that vision is by muddling it or by sacrificing overarching values for an end result. Unfortunately, a reason why good employees quit their jobs is that they don’t connect with their company’s values — or they don’t see the values being implemented in the workplace.
If your employees feel disconnected from your company’s values or, like in this case, that you’re willing to sacrifice them at any given moment, they’re not going to feel compelled to stay in their role. Employees want to understand a business’s mission: What is the business’s ultimate goal? What is everyone doing to reach that goal? What are the values the organization stands for on a day-to-day basis? Instilling consistent values and goals in your employees will give them a sense of purpose, inspiration and camaraderie — all of which will create an environment (and foster a positive company culture) in which they’re more likely to want to stay.
Cultivating an effective team can be a difficult task — especially as your business is growing and changing. This being said, however, considering the team environment that your employees are working in on a day-to-day basis is an essential part of small-business management. Certainly, a reason why good employees quit is that they have problems within their team. Unfortunately, this is a broad reason and there can be many facets within a poor team environment that causes an employee to leave.
Generally, employees want to work with like-minded individuals who contribute equally, are professional and communicate well. If they feel that their team members increasingly don’t fulfill these qualifications, they’re more likely to search for a position with a better team environment. Similarly, if certain employees feel they work harder while other members slack off, this too can create resentment and problems within a team.
Or, team issues can be as straightforward as a lack of diversity. A female on a consistently all-male team may be disheartened by the lack of diversity in her environment and look for a job where she can find a more diverse workplace. To prevent issues within the various teams in your organizations, you’ll want to consider many of the points discussed thus far. Promoting a healthy work environment, training and hiring the right managers, establishing your company’s values — all of these factors can help foster positive team interactions and growth as well.
It’s not only important for your employees to have the right managers, but for them to have good leadership across the wider sphere of the company. Although employees may be satisfied with some facets of their job, if they feel the higher leadership is poor or ineffective, this can greatly affect their willingness to remain in a job. After all, transparency, hard work and company values start from the top. Employees want to have faith in their leaders and see that they’re working hard to grow the company and foster a positive work environment.
To prevent your employees from leaving due to these kinds of issues, you’ll not only want to hire competent, experienced leaders but also ensure that your management is working and acting in a way that benefits the organization as a whole.
Our last reason why good employees quit is perhaps one of the most important. Although people may casually throw around the phrase “work-life balance,” it’s still a significant concept to consider within the context of your business. At the end of the day, therefore, all work-life balance means is that you respect the fact that your employees have lives outside of work.
More than likely, your employees will be more productive, enthusiastic and engaged when they know that their company trusts them and encourages them to have a life when they leave the office. You don’t want your employees to feel like they have to work 24 hours a day or can’t take a vacation day when they want one. Similarly, although compassion and understanding are not required in these situations, they often go a long way to keeping employees in your organization.
Although this situation might not reflect an everyday occurrence, simply considering the fact that things like this happen in people’s lives and giving your employees the support and freedom to deal with them can make a huge impact.

The expense ratio is calculated by dividing a mutual fund’s operating expenses by the average total dollar value of all the assets in the fund. Expense ratios are listed on the prospectus of every fund and on many financial websites.
A number of factors determine whether an expense ratio is considered high or low. A good expense ratio, from the investor's viewpoint, is around 0.5% to 0.75% for an actively managed portfolio. An expense ratio greater than 1.5% is considered high.
The expense ratio for mutual funds is typically higher than expense ratios for ETFs.2﻿ This is because ETFs are passively managed. The assets held in them are selected to mirror an index such as the S&P 500, and changes to the selection rarely need to be made. A mutual fund, on the other hand, is actively managed. The assets in them are constantly monitored and changed to maximize the performance of the fund.
Mutual funds tend to carry higher expense ratios than ETFs because they require more hands-on management.
The average expense ratio for actively managed mutual funds is between 0.5% and 1.0%. They rarely exceed 2.5%. For passive index funds, the typical ratio is about 0.2%.
Expenses can vary significantly between types of funds. The category of investments, the strategy for investing, and the size of the fund can all affect the expense ratio. A fund with a smaller amount of assets usually has a higher expense ratio due to its limited fund base for covering costs.
International funds can have high operational expenses because they may require staffing in several countries.
Large-cap funds, with an average expense ratio of 1.25%, are typically less expensive than small-cap funds, which average 1.4%.
Fund expenses can make a significant difference in an investor's profit. If a fund realizes an overall annual return of 5% but charges expenses that total 2%, then 40% of the fund's return is eaten by fees.
That's why investors should always compare expenses when researching funds. A fund's expenses will be listed in its prospectus and on the company's website, and can be found on many financial websites.
As index funds have become more popular, they have encouraged lower expense ratios. Index funds replicate the return on a specific market index. This type of investing is considered passive. Their portfolio managers buy and hold a representative sample of the securities in the target indexes, and then leave them alone unless the index itself changes. Thus, index funds tend to have below-average expense ratios.
The managers of funds that are actively managed may increase or reduce the fund's exposure to individual stocks or entire sectors. They undertake considerable research and analysis when considering stocks and bonds. This additional work means that investments under active management are more costly.
Actively managed portfolios tend to be wider-ranging. Their managers look at stocks with varying market capitalizations as well as international companies and specialized sectors. Managing the assets requires more expertise.
As a general rule, mutual funds that invest in large companies should have an expense ratio of no more than 1%, while a fund that focuses on small companies or international stocks should have an expense ratio lower than 1.25%.
Like most things, you often get what you pay for. In the world of investing, however, there is ample evidence that low-cost passive funds that employ an indexing strategy often outperform active management, especially after accounting for fees and taxes. For active funds, expense ratios that are high need to be justified by extraordinary returns, or must confer some other benefit to investors since competition has made management fees decline so sharply over the past decade.

If you’re an investor, you need to know about expense ratios. These fees — inherent in all mutual funds, index funds and exchange-traded funds — can significantly drag down your portfolio returns. And while they can’t be avoided completely, if you invest in these funds, you can take steps to keep these costs as low as possible.
when you open and fund an account with Webull.
Expense ratios are annual fees that investors pay to cover a fund's expenses, such as management and marketing. If you invest in a fund with a 1% expense ratio, you’ll pay $10 annually for every $1,000 invested. Expense ratios are subtracted automatically, making them easy to miss.
To find a fund's expense ratio you have to dig into the fund’s prospectus — available on the fund company’s website, or you can look on the fund’s information page on your online broker’s or retirement plan provider’s website. If you work with a financial advisor, he or she should also share information about these expenses with you.
Over time, expense ratios can really eat into your returns. This calculator will show you how the difference between two expense ratios adds up over time.
To figure out if you’re paying too much, it helps to know how much you should be paying. These fees vary widely, even among the same type of fund. For example, a Standard & Poor’s 500 fund offered by one broker could charge significantly more than a similar fund offered by another broker; a simple switch could save you money without sacrificing returns.
To recognize whether you’re paying too much for your investments — or know if you should pat yourself on the back for getting a good deal — you should occasionally shop the funds offered by your broker to see if you can find a similar fund for less. Likewise, you can look at funds offered by other brokers, as switching may offer enough of a savings to be worth the hassle.
It also helps to know the asset-weighted average expense ratio for various fund categories, so you can see where you stand. This number represents the average expense ratio that investors are paying.
When you compare your fund’s fees, be sure you’re comparing apples to apples — in other words, funds of both the same type and the same investment approach. Actively managed mutual funds employ a professional manager who makes investment decisions on a day-to-day basis; these funds will charge more as a result.
Passive funds like index funds and exchange-traded funds track an index rather than having a professional manager. By saving on that cost they can charge lower fees to investors.
per trade. Other fees apply.
Yes, you should focus on and understand these fees. But you also want to look at other costs that can be a drag on your portfolio, such as administrative fees in a 401(k) or other employer-provided retirement plans, and mutual fund sales loads. If a portion of your portfolio involves stock trading, you’ll pay commissions on each trade. Those commissions generally apply to exchange-traded funds as well, because they trade on an exchange like a stock. But these days, many full-service brokers and IRA account providers offer a wide range of commission-free ETFs, letting you avoid those costs on ETF trades.

In real life, that means if the fund spends $100,000 a year on operating costs and has $10 million in assets, its expense ratio would be 0.01, or 1%.
Sometimes expense ratios are expressed as basis points, or bps. 100 bps is equal to 1%,  so if a fund charges 40 basis points, the expense ratio will be 0.40%. If it charges 3 bps, the expense ratio will be 0.03%.
Expense ratios are annual operating costs and they are automatically deducted from your returns. How frequently these expenses are charged varies: Some funds deduct from your investment each day, others at regular intervals throughout the year. But however frequently those expense ratios are charged, they are simply taken out of your return, meaning you won’t receive a bill for them.
In general expense ratios have been trending downward, which is great for long-term investors since they will pay less for their investments. In recent years expense funds have dropped significantly, with a few funds not charging a cent (and many more charging fees under 0.20%).

If staying at home was the theme of Chase Freedom’s bonus categories for the second quarter of 2022, cardholders will be rewarded in the third quarter for going out and about.

Fitness clubs and gym memberships.
Gas stations and electric vehicle charging.
The inclusion of gas stations in Chase’s third quarter bonus categories will be welcome news for many cardholders as gas prices continue to set record highs. Despite the rising fuel costs, plenty of Americans plan to travel by car this summer. If you’re determined to get away, the Chase Freedom Flex℠ can minimize the damage to your wallet.
In another nod to Americans’ desire to get out of the house after two years of COVID lockdowns, rental cars is a bonus category for Chase Freedom cardholders in the third quarter. Renting a car for those longer road trips will spare your own car from wear and tear, and when you pay for a rental car booked directly through the car agency with your card you’ll earn an impressive 5% cash back.
If you have a credit card that gives primary rental coverage, the protection you’ll get from that card may be worth more than the 5% cash back you’d get from using a Chase Freedom credit card, which only offers secondary insurance.
The last time Chase offered movies as a bonus category was in 2017. If you’re ready to return to the theater — ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" anyone? — take your Freedom card with you to get 5% cash back on tickets.
Live entertainment is a new bonus category for Chase, and it’s quite broad. Tickets to sporting events, zoos, aquariums, concerts, museums, amusement parks and more all qualify for 5% cash back. With such an extensive list of eligible purchases, it should be relatively easy to get cash back whether you’re taking a staycation or leaving town.

0.207317073170732,"It's possible you'll enjoy your vacation more if you don't have to go into debt for it.
Like most vacations, the cost of a trip to the Hawaiian Islands depends on how far in advance you plan. Price is also determined by the steps you take to minimize ""big"" costs, and what you do once you're on an island. Here, we'll outline some of the easiest ways to visit Hawaii on a budget.
Visiting Hawaii during peak season can cost you big. Peak season is when the greatest number of tourists make their way to the islands -- and when airlines, hotels, car rental companies, and restaurants charge premium prices. Instead, aim to visit during one of the least expensive months, like January or September.
Unless you're willing to spring for the cost of transportation between islands, your best bet for vacationing on a budget is to choose one island and stick with it for the duration of your trip. Not only will you save on air or water travel, but renting a car can be less expensive if you keep it for the entire trip. If you're looking for the island with the best bargains to offer, Oahu will likely fit the bill. While Oahu is the third largest of the Hawaiian Islands, it's home to the state capital, Honolulu, and the world-famous Waikiki beach. Due to abundant options for lodging and food, prices tend to be more competitive on Oahu than on some other islands. Also -- depending on what you have planned for your stay -- it's possible to get by without a rental car if you stay near Waikiki.
Alert: highest cash back card we’ve seen now has 0% intro APR for 15 months. Learn more here.
As travel restrictions lift, more people are taking to the air. And the influx of enthusiastic travelers has led to higher airline prices. Your best bet for traveling on a budget is to plan your Hawaiian getaway as early as possible. If you've been saving credit card airline miles, now is the time to pull them out. Schedule your travel in the off season and look for early morning or late evening flights for the lowest fares.

Like the rest of the world, Hawaii was hit hard by the financial impact of COVID-19. With almost no tourists for a year, hotels are aching to get their rooms filled. Check travel sites to learn which hotels offer the deepest discounts and best perks (like free drinks, meals for children, or tickets to local attractions).
If your trip to Hawaii is more about backpacking through the forest than luxuriating at a spa, a hostel is a great low-price lodging option. If you're not familiar with hostels, think back to summer camp with dormitory-style sleeping and shared public spaces. Polynesian Hostel Beach Club and Waikiki Beachside Hostel are inexpensive but located in the heart of the action.
HomeExchange, as the name implies, is a service that lets you trade your home with someone else long enough to enjoy a vacation. Through homeexchange.com, it's as easy as filling out a profile and listing your property. You let people know when your home will be available, add nice photos, and look for homes on the island that appeal to you. Once you've found something, you can send a personalized message to the owner of the Hawaiian property, asking if they're interested in swapping houses. (This will be easier if you live in a city people want to visit.) The cost of becoming a member of HomeExchange for a year is $150, but you can make unlimited exchanges during that time.
Camping may not be the first thing you think of when you consider visiting Hawaii, but if you're up for the challenge, it's a great way to trim your budget. You can pitch a tent or rent an RV on the island. Be sure to check out all campsites available as amenities vary by site. One quick note about renting an RV: By combining the price of lodging and transportation, you're likely to save money, particularly if you travel during the off season.
Another option is to look into Turo, a company that matches Hawaii residents with a car to spare with tourists looking for a car to rent. Like traditional rental car services, demand for cars is high on Turo, so it may take a bit of wading through the options to find an available vehicle that works with your budget.
If you stay on Oahu, you have the option of getting an all-inclusive discount pass. This pass not only saves money but it allows you to book slots for the activities you want to take part in while they're still available.
But a discount pass isn't the only way to score a deal. For just $80 per year, you can pre-purchase an annual pass to nearly all federally-operated lands from the National Parks Service, which includes access to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.
There's no rule saying you have to plan the entire trip yourself. Take advantage of sites like TravelZoo or Expedia to find discounted Hawaiian vacation packages.
Saving money can also be accomplished by gassing up your car at a big-box warehouse store, like Sam's Club or Costco (if you have a membership). You can also save by planning which meals you want to eat out and picking up supplies for simple meals at one of the big-box stores or a local grocery store.
The great thing about traveling on a budget is that it reminds you why you're there -- to experience the island. The fact that you can enjoy vacation without gouging your bank account is an added bonus.

When deciding where to travel, Hawaii checks all the boxes for many tourists. The islands’ lush, tropical landscape provides a contrast from two years of mostly staying at home. It’s a far-off getaway that doesn't require a passport, and there’s no shortage of luxury.
Within the first two weeks of Hawaii's announcement to lift travel restrictions, Expedia says it saw a nearly 30% increase in searches for spring and summer trips to Hawaii’s major ports. Domestic travelers no longer need to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test to enter Hawaii as of March 26, 2022.
Demand in some of the top destinations in Hawaii is outpacing pre-pandemic levels. Expedia says it’s already seeing six times more bookings for hotels on Hawaii’s Big Island for September 2022 than it did in September 2019. Oahu — which Expedia says is one of the most popular destinations — is seeing double digit-percentage increases in demand this summer versus 2019.
But while Hawaii might have a laid-back, low-stress vibe, the rules of supply and demand still apply. Couple that with rising travel costs everywhere due to rapid inflation, and a trip to Hawaii this year likely won’t be cheap.
However, you can still save money on a Hawaiian vacation. Here’s how to travel to Hawaii on a budget.
If you’ve accumulated a stash of points and miles, flights to Hawaii can prove a good way to spend them. There are many ways to book cheap Hawaii flights with points and miles, especially if you’re willing to transfer miles between partner airlines. Among the biggest airlines flying to Hawaii are Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines.
If you can earn a Southwest Airlines Companion Pass and you’d like to save on flights to Hawaii, this is an excellent opportunity to use it. The pass is essentially a buy-one-get-one deal on your Southwest flight, where you book a flight with cash or points, and you can book another at no cost aside from taxes and fees (typically just $5.60 per one-way trip).
If you can’t choose just one island, island-hopping in Hawaii is fairly convenient, as most flights between islands take less than an hour. The key when island-hopping: flexibility. Most of the best interisland deals are for flights through Honolulu’s Daniel K. Inouye International Airport, so consider placing Oahu in the middle of your itinerary to take advantage of its interisland availability.
Be flexible on dates, too. Southwest has plenty of interisland airfares for just $45 — but if you’re married to a specific flight time or book last-minute, realize that some flights cost more than $200.
Most of the major hotel brands have a strong presence in Hawaii, which can be handy if you have hotel points or free night certificates.
Hilton is an especially big player in Hawaii, and its lodging runs the gamut from affordable to opulent. If you have a Hilton free night certificate, which can be earned through certain Hilton credit cards, head to Maui. There you’ll find the Grand Wailea, a Waldorf Astoria Resort. One of Hilton’s most grandiose resorts, the Grand Wailea hosts a 2,000-foot-long pool complete with waterfalls and slides. Standard nightly room rates can easily run more than $1,500, but free night certificates can cover it.
If you’re traveling as a family or with a group, consider booking a vacation rental through a service like Airbnb or Vrbo. They are sometimes cheaper than hotels and typically don’t require you to pay resort fees, which are otherwise common. They also often have driveways and kitchens, so you can avoid expensive hotel parking and the cost of dining out.
Speaking of dining out, it can certainly be part of the Hawaiian experience. But it can also eat up a huge chunk of your budget. Understand when you’re paying for mediocre food but a stellar view. If you’re up for adventure, head to a convenience store for fresh poke and Spam musubi, then find a beach (there’s no shortage of them) for a free, oceanfront dinner view.
As far as entertainment, you can certainly pay hundreds of dollars for your group to experience a luau. While the array of entertainment and buffet food can be worth it for some travelers, there are plenty of free ways to watch hula, hear Hawaiian music and learn about the culture. Many major malls in Hawaii, such as Waikiki’s Royal Hawaiian Center mall, offer free shows and classes in lei making, hula, ukulele, lauhala weaving and more. On the Big Island, free coffee farm tours are abundant.
Some hotels also make their entertainment available to the public. Head to Marriott’s Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa to watch the nightly lele kawa (cliff jumping).
Some major, ticketed tourist attractions offer some components of their tours for free. At the Maui Tropical Plantation, you might pay $25 for a tram tour, but you can still explore a good chunk of the grounds, including its market, craft studios and cafe, at no cost. On Oahu, Dole Plantation tours start at $7.75 per person, but purchasing a ticket might not be necessary. Admission to the grounds is free, and there you can typically find no-cost activities like pineapple-cutting and chocolate-making demonstrations, as well as a fish feeding pond.
Travel to Hawaii was always popular — and all signs point to its popularity growing. According to a February 2022 NerdWallet survey, 28% of Americans who say the way they travel has chanced since the beginning of the pandemic say they have stopped going on international trips and only travel domestically. Meanwhile, 16% only travel to destinations that don’t require COVID-19 testing or proof of vaccination. For tourists from the continental U.S., Hawaii checks both of those boxes, and a lot more. The Aloha State might be one of the best places to travel to this year — just have a plan for how you’ll pay for it.
