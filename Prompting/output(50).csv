A firmware update at the end of the month will mark the end of an era for PlayStation 3 owners. The update will remove Life with PlayStation, an app that allowed users to contribute to Stanford University's Folding@home distributed computing project. The project has been a game-changer for researchers studying diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer, using the processing power of PS3s to simulate protein folding.

**The End of an Era: PlayStation 3's Folding@home App to Be Discontinued**

In a move that's left many gamers and researchers alike scratching their heads, Sony has announced that it will be discontinuing the Life with PlayStation app, which allowed PS3 owners to contribute to Stanford University's Folding@home distributed computing project. The app, which leveraged the processing power of networked computers and PS3s to simulate protein folding, was a game-changer for researchers studying diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer.

Vijay Pande, Folding@home's research lead, praised the PS3 system, saying it ""opened the door for new methods and new processors, eventually also leading to the use of GPUs."" Over 15 million users participated in the project, contributing a staggering 100 million computation hours. The PS3's unique Cell processor was particularly well-suited to the task, offering computational speeds far in advance of typical PCs or competing consoles like the Xbox 360.

The Folding@home site will continue to operate, but the loss of the PS3 app will undoubtedly be felt. As we move forward in an era of increasingly powerful computing, it's worth considering the impact of such projects on the scientific community and the role that gamers can play in advancing our understanding of complex diseases.

**What's Next for Distributed Computing?**

The discontinuation of the Life with PlayStation app raises questions about the future of distributed computing projects. Can other platforms fill the gap left by the PS3? How will researchers adapt to the loss of this powerful tool? We'll be exploring these questions and more in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for further updates."
1.0,"California became just the third state in the nation to pass a ""right to repair"" consumer protection law on Tuesday, following Minnesota and New York, when Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 244.

Turns out Google isn't offering seven years of replacement parts and software updates to the Pixel 8 out of the goodness of its un-beating corporate heart. The new law directly stipulates that all electronics and appliances costing $50 or more, and sold within the state after July 1, 2021 (yup, two years ago), will be covered under the legislation once it goes into effect next year, on July 1, 2024.
For gear and gadgets that cost between $50 and $99, device makers will have to stock replacement parts and tools, and maintain documentation for three years. Anything over $100 in value gets covered for the full seven-year term. Companies that fail to do so will be fined $1,000 per day on the first violation, $2,000 a day for the second and $5,000 per day per violation thereafter.
There are, of course, carve outs and exceptions to the rules. No, your PS5 is not covered. Not even that new skinny one. None of the game consoles are, neither are alarm systems or heavy industrial equipment that ""vitally affects the general economy of the state, the public interest, and the public welfare.""
The bill even received support from Apple, of all companies. The tech giant famous for its ""walled garden"" product ecosystem had railed against the idea when it was previously proposed in Nebraska, claiming the state would become ""a mecca for hackers.""

Because California is one of the world’s largest economies, this iFixit-cosponsored bill may make it easier for people all over the US to repair their devices.
The law, which joins similar efforts in New York, Colorado, and Minnesota, is tougher than some of its predecessors.
California is home to a number of device makers, most notably Apple, which came out in support of the bill after initially trying to stall it. As a practical matter, the California law may benefit consumers in places without such laws. For instance, Google, also headquartered in California, recently confirmed that the Pixel 8 series will get seven years of spare parts  — the same number the California bill mandates.

The company’s current Samsung Free app, which offers access to news articles, podcasts, live TV and games, will be rebranded to Samsung News. Unlike Samsung Free, the new revamped app solely focuses on news and podcasts, just like Apple News.
Samsung News offers access to news content from a variety of news outlets, including Axios, CNN, Fortune, Huffington Post, Newsweek, Reuters, Sports Illustrated, USA Today and more. Samsung says additional news outlets will be added to the app over time.
You can access news within the app through categorized feeds or though a “Following” tab that you can customize with your preferences based on the news you want to see. Samsung News also includes daily briefings that are delivered twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening. The company says these briefings are compilid by a team of news editors to bring users the top headlines of the day in one place. There’s also the option to listen to podcasts within the app.
Samsung News is rolling out to U.S. Samsung Galaxy users as an update to Samsung Free starting today. Users who already have the Samsung Free app on their device will see the icon change to Samsung News starting today when their apps are updated. If you don’t already have the Free app, you can download the new News app directly from the Samsung Galaxy Store.
Although Samsung Galaxy users have had quick access to news via the Free app in the past, it’s been hidden and not that well-known. And of course, Samsung Galaxy users have had access to Google News as well, but today’s launch brings Samsung more in-line with what Apple offers its users through Apple News.","Samsung is replacing its Free app on Galaxy devices with a client that's more focused, if also a little familiar. The company is launching a beta News app that, somewhat like its Apple equivalent, concentrates on top headlines (here organized into morning and evening briefings) as well as customizable feeds. Unlike many other news apps, though, you can also listen to podcasts.
The app will reach US-based Galaxy hardware in the weeks ahead, and will automatically replace Free if it's already installed. You can otherwise download it from Samsung's Galaxy Store. The news will initially come from ""trusted partners"" that include Bloomberg, Huffington Post (formerly a sibling brand of Engadget) and Sports Illustrated. More outlets and additional features are coming, Samsung says.
The change may create a few hassles. Free combined news with Samsung TV Plus channels and casual gaming. Now, you'll have to go to separate apps to access that content. However, the News app may be considerably more useful if you're catching up on the day's events, or want to listen to a recap during the commute home.
There's no mention of a paid service comparable to Apple News+, which offers access to some subscription-only news sources as well as magazines. However, the strategy isn't all that different.

Samsung Unveils ""Samsung News"" App, a Revamped Take on News Consumption

In a move to reinvigorate its news offerings, Samsung today announced the introduction of ""Samsung News"", a revamped app that streamslines news content from a diverse range of publications. This shift marks a significant departure from the company's current ""Samsung Free"" app, which will be rebranded to Samsung News.

Unlike its predecessor, the new Samsung News app takes a laser-like focus on news and podcasts, echoing Apple's own news aggregation approach. The app grants users access to a wide array of news outlets, including Axios, CNN, Fortune, Huffington Post, Newsweek, Reuters, Sports Illustrated, and USA Today, among others. Samsung has pledged to continually expand its roster of partner news organizations over time.

Users can navigate news content through categorized feeds or personalize the ""Following"" tab to suit their individual news preferences. Samsung News also delivers twice-daily briefings, expertly curated by a team of news editors to distill the top headlines of the day into a concise, easily digestible format. Moreover, the app enables seamless podcast listening.

1.0,"Amazon today announced a new feature that will turn Alexa into a reading companion for children, as well as new support for Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids, which personalize the child’s Alexa experience across all Echo devices in the household. The two features go hand in hand, as the Voice Profile allows Alexa to identify who’s speaking, so the device can appropriately respond to a request like “Alexa, let’s read.” Alexa will then start the reading companion experience, which Amazon is calling Reading Sidekick.
This feature isn’t available to all Alexa device owners, as it requires an Amazon Kids+ subscription. This is the $2.99 per month subscription service that also provides families with children access to thousands of kid-friendly books, TV shows, movies, educational apps and games, in addition to premium content for Echo devices, like ad-free radio stations and playlists, Audible books, and exclusive Alexa skills.
Once subscribed, the child can then direct Alexa to read with them and they’ll pick up a compatible book or ebook to get started. Alexa will ask what book they’re reading and how much does the child want to read: a lot, a little, or taking turns? The feature works with the hundreds of children’s books for ages 6 to 9 that are included as part of the Amazon Kids+ subscription, including both the print or digital versions. When it’s the child’s turn to read, Alexa will listen and provide encouragement when the child is doing well and will offer support when the child is struggling.
Meanwhile, support for new Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids will also begin rolling out starting today. This opt-in feature allows parents or guardians to create a voice profile for each child in their family (up to four kids). When enabled, the Alexa experience will be personalized to the individual speaking. That means Alexa will automatically apply the appropriate parental controls that have been configured, automatically filter explicit music, limit calls and messages sent through Alexa only to approved contacts, and restrict the child only to the Alexa skills parents have pre-approved. Alexa will also provide the child with access to kid-friendly games, skills, music and videos and will provide kid-friendly responses to kids’ inquiries.
While features like these can make the Alexa experience more fun and useful for families, parents have to weigh their comfort with having their children’s voices recorded and analyzed and determine how long they would want such recordings stored. Today, Amazon uses kids’ voice recordings to train its speech recognition and natural language understanding systems in order to improve Alexa’s ability to understand children’s questions and requests. In some number of cases, these recordings are also manually reviewed. Parents who don’t want to participate can delete recordings associated with their child’s history either one-by-one or all at once via the Alexa app Settings. They can also set recordings to automatically delete on an ongoing 3-month or 18-month basis and can delete recordings via voice requests.
However, if the parent chooses not to save the child’s recordings, they’ll not be able to go back through the history to see the requests their child has made over time from the Parent Dashboard.
Every parent will need to make a decision about what’s right for their own household before enabling features like Reading Sidekick or Voice Profiles, or, more broadly about whether they want to bring a smart speaker of any kind into their home.
Amazon says the new Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids should reach all Amazon customers by Friday, July 2. Reading Sidekick is available today.","Amazon Echo smart speakers can now read along with your child's favorite Kindle and print books. Alexa listens, corrects mistakes and occasionally repeats a passage to help kids learn.
Amazon Reading Sidekick lets Alexa read along with your kids on any Amazon Echo Kids device.
It's easy to forget that the same website where you can now order a Nicholas Cage plush pillow, pickle-flavored lip balm and Alexa smart speakers started off as one of the world's first online book retailers. However, I was reminded of Amazon's humble origin story when I sat down to try out Reading Sidekick, the new Alexa-powered reading companion for kids.
Reading Sidekick has a deceptively simple format that lets children (or adult learners) take turns reading with Alexa from an ever-expanding list of both print and ebooks in the 6- to 9-year-old reading level range. Amazon's voice assistant actively listens, evaluating student readers' pronunciation and accuracy, then custom-tailors feedback depending on whether or not readers blunder, as well as how much.
Acknowledging that children's feelings are notoriously easy to hurt, Amazon took care to really cinch the algorithm that determines what kind of feedback -- and how much of it -- Alexa should give when readers stumble. The results are almost uncanny (and a lesson to amateur reading tutors everywhere).
Alexa will only correct readers if they stray far from the text while reading.
If you skip over a word or two (or just slightly mispronounce a few), Alexa won't call you out on it. Instead, Amazon's voice assistant just keeps cheering you on. Alexa's infectiously positive attitude only goes so far, however. If you mangle the English language creatively enough (to the point that comprehension could suffer), Alexa will repeat the section you beefed before moving on to read the next one.
Alexa will even notice if you're stuck on a single word and give you a little push by pronouncing it for you, to help you keep moving along. Honestly, it's one of the most natural and, I'd say, useful applications of machine learning I've experienced.
Sidekick won't arrive on your Amazon Echo free of charge, however -- it's included in the $3-a-month Amazon Kids Plus service, which gives you and your kids access to scores of other activities, educational games and stories as well. Plus, Amazon includes a one-year subscription ($36 value) with the purchase of an Echo Show Kids device.
The Echo Show Kids smart display comes with a free one-year subscription to Kids Plus, which includes Reading Sidekick.
To get started reading with Sidekick, your child just has to say, ""Alexa, let's read."" From there, Alexa will first ask for a book title, then ask, ""Do you want to read a little, read a lot, or take turns?""
Answer, ""A little,"" and Alexa will read most of it, only having the child read the occasional short page. ""A lot"" flips the script, with the child reading about four times as much material as Alexa. ""Take turns,"" divides reading duties roughly in half.
Inevitably, a cynic will claim Amazon is trying to replace parents or teachers with a robot. I asked Amazon Learning and Education Lead Marissa Mierow how she'd respond to such a critic.
""We certainly don't see Sidekick as a replacement for cherished time when you're reading to your kids or with your kids,"" Mierow said. ""We absolutely see it as a complement to all the other means by which teachers, parents, grandparents are using reading tools.""
As a decidedly pro-technology parent, that's the answer I was hoping to hear.

Amazon uses kids' voice recordings to improve Alexa's ability to understand children's questions and requests, and in some cases, these recordings are manually reviewed. Parents who don't want to participate can delete recordings associated with their child's history either one by one or all at once via the Alexa app Settings.

Every parent will need to make a decision about what's right for their own household before enabling features like Reading Sidekick or Voice Profiles. Amazon says the new Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids should reach all Amazon customers by Friday, July 2. Reading Sidekick is available today.

The new features aim to make the Alexa experience more fun and useful for families, but parents must consider the implications of having their children's voices recorded and analyzed.

Amazon Unveils Reading Companion Feature for Children, Expands Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids

Amazon on Wednesday announced a significant update to its Alexa ecosystem, introducing a new feature that transforms the virtual assistant into a reading companion for children. The company is also expanding its Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids, a feature that personalizes the Alexa experience for each child in a household.

The Reading Sidekick feature, available exclusively to Amazon Kids+ subscribers, allows children to engage in an interactive reading experience with Alexa. By leveraging the power of voice recognition, Alexa can identify the child's voice and respond accordingly, creating a seamless and engaging experience.

To access the feature, parents must first subscribe to Amazon Kids+, a $2.99 per month service that provides access to a vast library of kid-friendly content, including books, TV shows, movies, educational apps, and games. Once subscribed, children can direct Alexa to read with them, and the virtual assistant will prompt them to select a compatible book or ebook.

The feature is designed to work with hundreds of children's books, including both print and digital versions, and is tailored for children aged 6 to 9. Alexa will ask the child how much they want to read and will provide encouragement and support as needed.

In addition to the Reading Sidekick feature, Amazon is also rolling out support for Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids, an opt-in feature that allows parents to create a personalized voice profile for each child in their household. This feature enables Alexa to automatically apply parental controls, filter explicit content, and restrict access to approved contacts and skills.

While these features have the potential to enhance the Alexa experience for families, parents must carefully consider the implications of having their children's voices recorded and analyzed. Amazon uses these recordings to improve its speech recognition and natural language understanding systems, and in some cases, manually reviews them. Parents can delete recordings associated with their child's history or set them to automatically delete on a 3-month or 18-month basis.

The rollout of Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids is expected to be completed by Friday, July 2, while the Reading Sidekick feature is available today. As Amazon continues to expand its Alexa ecosystem, parents must weigh the benefits of these features against their concerns about data privacy and security."
1.0,"Earlier this year, Amazon launched Build It, a fun little program that lets customers preorder concept devices. Think about it like Indiegogo or Kickstarter, where the company will only actually make the product if enough people buy-in via preorder. Obviously Amazon has a significantly larger ability to absorb a misstep than your average first-time hardware startup, but I digress.
This latest round isn’t particularly experimental as far as these things go. The company partnered with fashion mogul Diane von Furstenberg to create new coverings for its popular entry-level smart speaker. The Echo Dot x Diane von Furstenberg is being offered up in three varieties: Midnight Kiss, Ikat or Twigs. It’s not exactly thew new product entries we saw the first time out, which included a sticky note printer, smart scale and Alexa cuckoo clock.
Each runs $59 — the price of the Echo Dot with clock and $10 more than the standard Dot. The product looks to otherwise be the same as the latest gen Echo Dot. The company says it will be donating to Vital Voices, a charity chosen by the designer — though it wouldn’t specify how much when we asked.
Preorders open now and close August 13. If the designs don’t hit their goal, customers won’t be charged. Once they’re live, “a select number of successful prints may be available at full price after the campaign closes, while supplies last,” according to Amazon.","Amazon is launching the next line of products for its Build It crowdfunding platform. The company has collaborated with fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg on a range of Echo Dot smart speakers that’ll only go on sale if enough people pre-order them within 30 days.
That’s by no means a given. Amazon launched the Build It program earlier this year with three Alexa-powered devices — a nutrition scale, a cuckoo clock, and a sticky note printer — and only the last of those reached its goal in time. Amazon currently estimates that the Smart Sticky Note Printer will ship between July and September, but if you didn’t get in on the Build It campaign, you can’t pre-order it right now.
The Echo Dot x Diane von Furstenberg range comes in three variations: Midnight Kiss, Ikat, and Twigs. They all have a “special promo price” of $59.99 each, which is $10 more than a regular fourth-gen Dot or the same price as the cute panda and tiger Kids Edition model.

The resulting devices, dubbed Echo Dot x Diane von Furstenberg, come in three distinct styles: Midnight Kiss, Ikat, and Twigs. While not as experimental as some of the previous concepts, these limited-edition designs are a departure from the usual fare.

This latest effort is a far cry from the inaugural Build It program, which featured innovative products like a sticky note printer, smart scale, and Alexa-enabled cuckoo clock.

With nearly all of its stores now out of business, the retailer’s creditors have sued Sprint and are accusing the wireless carrier of backstabbing RadioShack and destroying any hope of a great American comeback story.

That was back when RadioShack had freshly emerged from bankruptcy and was oddly hopeful that adding Sprint (by then the fourth largest US carrier) to its stores could somehow help turn things around and hold off the hand of fate. In this case, that’s the hand of Jeff Bezos and internet shopping.
It didn’t work. RadioShack couldn’t escape the fall back into bankruptcy and eventually threw in the towel. Throughout May, the company held everything must go liquidation sales to get rid of all that was left — shelving included — in nearly all of its remaining stores.

The carrier also failed to hold up its end of the bargain when it came to providing staffing and inventory, according to the complaint. “Sprint’s action destroyed nearly 6,000 RadioShack jobs,” said the lawsuit, which was filed in Delaware Superior Court on Wednesday.
Sprint has said it will fight the lawsuit and is disappointed with the creditors’ decision to start a legal battle.","A US bankruptcy court has approved a plan to save RadioShack's remaining retail stores.
RadioShack, founded in 1921 to serve the then emerging radio equipment market, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February. But some RadioShack stores will survive after the company was bought by hedge fund Standard General. In keeping the stores open, Standard is sharing store space with wireless carrier Sprint. As reported by Reuters, the stores will carry both the Radio Shack and Sprint names, and Sprint will occupy about a third of each store.
The deal came Tuesday amidst protests from lenders that could have killed RadioShack's chances for survival. Reuters explains that RadioShack was forced to finalize a deal by April because Chapter 11 give companies only a few months to break leases, which is critical for retailers. Only about 1,740 of RadioShack's more than 4,000 stores have survived the bankruptcy. But the new deal is expected to save as many as 7,500 RadioShack jobs still in place.
According to Reuters, RadioShack’s largest lender, Salus Capital Partners, opposed the Standard General deal, claiming that it had made a more lucrative bid for the retailer's assets. Judge Brendan Shannon, who decided the case, disagreed. Although the Salus bid may have offered more cash, Shannon determined that Standard General's bid, which included significant debt forgiveness, was superior.

RadioShack's Last Gasp: Sprint Sued for $500 Million

RadioShack, the once-beloved electronics retailer, is throwing one final punch as it goes down. The company's creditors have filed a lawsuit against Sprint, accusing the wireless carrier of sabotaging RadioShack's chances of a comeback. The creditors are seeking a whopping $500 million in damages.

The drama began back in 2015, when RadioShack emerged from bankruptcy and entered into a co-branding partnership with Sprint. The deal was meant to breathe new life into RadioShack's struggling business, but it ultimately proved to be a fatal blow. According to the lawsuit, Sprint used confidential data to identify the best locations for its own retail stores, effectively undercutting RadioShack's chances of success.

1.0,"Learn more about the history behind Adams' unfinished ""Doctor Who"" episode called “Shada” and how fans can see an animated version of it soon.
A ""Doctor Who"" story written by the author of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" sounds like the ultimate sci-fi pairing, but sadly Douglas Adams' '70s script for an episode called ""Shada"" never saw the light of day.
A video posted by the official ""Doctor Who"" website on Monday explains why ""Shada"" was shelved. In 1979, ""Doctor Who"" was in its 17th season with actor Tom Baker playing the jovial Time Lord. The series was incredibly popular at the time, with over 11 million viewers tuning into the BBC.
Adams, who's best known for his witty sci-fi novels, was working script editor for ""Doctor Who"" at the time. He wrote three ""Doctor Who"" episodes: ""The Pirate Planet,"" ""City of Death"" and ""Shada.""
While the other two episodes aired, ""Shada"" (which would have been the last episode of the season) didn't finish filming because of trade union strikes in England that had also affected previous seasons 15 and 16 of ""Doctor Who.""
""Shada"" tells the tale of a mysterious book from Gallifrey that happens to be the key to a dark secret. The book goes missing in Cambridge with a villain in pursuit. Of course, the Doctor is called in to investigate.
Even with the labor strife holding up production, the ""Doctor Who"" team did manage to do some initial principle photography and filmed a few scenes around Cambridge University.
The ""Doctor Who"" team also completed a couple of scenes at the BBC Studios, but the building's doors remained locked until the strike was over. When filming could finally resume post-strike, however, the BBC prioritized studio space for Christmas specials and other programs. ""Doctor Who"" lost its chance to complete ""Shada"" and had to move on.
Tom Baker reprises his role as the Fourth Doctor in the upcoming animated version of the lost ""Doctor Who"" episode called ""Shada.""
While ""Shada"" wasn't filmed as a full ready-to-air episode, completed sequences ended up being used in the 20th-anniversary adventure called ""The Five Doctors"" in 1983.
Later, in 1992, some of ""Shada"" was released in a VHS with narration from Baker. And in 2003, the BBC website re-created ""Shada"" as a Flash animation. ""Shada"" has also been published as a novel in 2012, and released yet again as an audio book that same year.
Now ""Shada"" is coming out (yes, again) as a partially animated episode with the original actors -- including Baker as the Fourth Doctor and Lalla Ward as his traveling companion Romana -- performing missing scenes the original script. The episode will use digitally remastered clips for the original sequences and fill in the details with newly acted animation.
""Shada"" will be released as a digital download on Nov. 24, and on DVD and Blu-ray on Dec. 4.
Crowd Control: A crowdsourced science fiction novel written by CNET readers.
Batteries Not Included: The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech stuff is cool.","After an endless wait that felt like being trapped in a time loop, Doctor Who finally returned last night. But while the Season 10 premiere featured plenty of the usual time-traveling madness, it paid fealty to another major sci-fi influence—one that Who fans might already be familiar with, but establishes a surprising direction for the new season. A hint: He's just this guy, you know?
Douglas Adams is best known for writing Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but the author is also a major figure in the history of Doctor Who. He wrote or co-wrote three classic stories, including the beloved ""City of Death,"" and he also oversaw the show's scripts for a year. The relationship makes sense: His tongue-in-cheek approach is perfect for a TV show about an alien with a time machine and no social skills. And given that this season of* Doctor Who* seems to be going for a lighter touch after some intense darkness, it's fitting that the season opener is a bit of an Adams tribute.
When ""The Pilot"" begins, The Doctor is living and teaching at a fictional university in Bristol. He's been there for the past 50 years—yet, nobody seems to notice that one of the professors has outlasted even the most determined of tenured faculty. Who fans may recognize this from ""Shada,"" a never-completed story that Adams wrote for the 1979-1980 season: that planned arc featured another Time Lord who had spent decades teaching at Cambridge University (in the fictional St. Cedd's College), with nobody noticing his agelessness.
Just like Professor Chronotis, the renegade Time Lord in Adams' story, the current Doctor is hiding some incredibly valuable Time Lord artifact on campus---though at least he's gotten himself a fancy vault for it. Plenty of other Adams fill the episode as well. ""Bristol"" is the nickname the Doctor gives to Chris Parsons, one of his friends in ""Shada,"" and at one point during a lecture the Doctor says ""time is an illusion,"" which is the beginning of a *Hitchhiker's *quote (one which ends ""...lunchtime doubly so."").
Even the Dalek battle owes something to Adamas. When the Doctor takes off across the universe with his new companions Bill and Nardole, he visits a battle between the Daleks and a strangely familiar army of disco robots. These are the Movellans, who appeared in the 1979 story ""Destiny of the Daleks""---a script that may have been written by Terry Nation, but was very much a product of Adams' wholesale rewrite.
References aside, last night's episode is suffused with a distinctly Adams-esque sense of fun. To wit: the introduction of Bill (Pearl Mackie), as the Doctor's new companion. A young lesbian who works in the cafeteria serving ""chips"" (fries to Americans), Bill crashes the Doctor's lectures, and he notices her curious mind. So he plucks her out of the crowd and becomes her private tutor, leading to some lovely, giddy moments—like the two of them sitting and wearing paper crowns, or Bill's attempts to teach the Doctor about science fiction.
Meanwhile, the plot is somewhat forgettable: it revolves around Bill's crush on a girl named Heather (Stephanie Hyam), who discovers a puddle that gives a strange reflection. (It's one of writer Steven Moffat's trademark ""optical effect"" monsters.) After Heather takes a dip in the puddle, she comes back as a watery zombie—not unlike the watery zombies in the 2009 *Who *special ""Waters of Mars""—who then chases Bill and the Doctor all over the universe.
The real heart of the episode, though, lies in the spiky student-teacher relationship between the Doctor and Bill. With the Doctor an actual teacher (instead of simply lecturing on an amateur basis), his sparring with Bill is more vital and urgent than it has been with other recent Companions. And after years of the scarily competent Clara, it's refreshing to see the Doctor paired up with a human who's just figuring out the ropes---and whose quirky observations help to deflate the Doctor's pomposity.
Mackie's mixture of wide-eyed wonder and perfect British sarcasm gives Peter Capaldi a comedic partner to play off, and he takes full advantage. Given that dynamic, Bill feels like the Twelfth Doctor's answer to Donna, the snarky maniac who had great comic chemistry, but no sexual or romantic chemistry, with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant). That said, the humor doesn't always work: the episode could have done without the fat joke, or Bill taking twice as long as every other companion to grasp that the TARDIS is bigger inside than outside.
And yet, this Doctor Who episode fully earns its Douglas Adams references; its blend of silliness and spiky wit reminds fans that the show is often at its best when it's not taking itself seriously—and knows where its towel is.",Cnet,Wired,"Here is the rewritten document:

1.0,"Robots have shown themselves to excel at any number of sports and activities, though they do best when they have a single task. Fortunately some sports, such as curling, consist mostly of one task, and Korean researchers have made a robot that throws the stone well enough to compete at a national level.
If you’ve never gone curling yourself — first of all, for shame, it’s basically ice bocce and it’s very fun. But you may not know then that the principal action in the game is a simple but subtle one of gauging the power and angle (and spin, if you’re good) with which to slide a heavy kettle-shaped stone in order to get it near the center of a target, knock an opponent’s stone out of the way, or nudge another of your own into position. And that’s exactly what Curly the robot does.
The researchers, from Korea University in Seoul and the Berlin Institute of Technology, devised Curly as a way to test “the interaction between an AI system and a highly nonstationary real-world scenario.” In other words: A robot that can observe the real world and act accordingly in a precise and strategic manner.
Curly is actually a team of two robots, one of which observes the position of the stones at the scoring end while the other does the actual throwing. There’s no robot that sweeps the ice in front of the moving stone or yells “hard, hard!” but no doubt that is forthcoming.
The robots’ AI was trained entirely on computerized games, in which the stone and ice are physically simulated. One can see this type of training going well or poorly, depending on how accurate the simulation is. As it turns out, it works extremely well, giving Curly enough confidence that it only needs one throw at the beginning of each game in order to account for differing conditions like ice that’s more or less slick.
Its play is similarly impressive: Up against some of the country’s leading women’s teams and the national wheelchair team, Curly won three out of four rounds. One wonders whether permitting sweepers would change the outcome, but sufficient for the day is the achievement thereof.
The researchers point out that this is an important achievement not just because robots have been shown to be competitive in yet another sport, but because that sport involves fairly dynamic observation and decision-making in the real world and in real-time — the team can’t go retrain the network to deal with an unexpected setup. So it’s a win for both AI and robots in general, but also for the prospect of training such robots in simulated environments, which until fairly recently simply weren’t good enough to provide a reasonable facsimile of such complex physics.
You can read more about Curly and the complex AI and engineering that underpin it in the latest issue of the journal Science Robotics.","I’ve spent enough time in robotics labs to confidently say that machines are far, far from replacing humans en masse in the workforce. They’re still too clumsy and stupid to work on their own, so they’re more likely to automate parts of your job. But I’ll be honest, I did not see this one coming: A robot named Curly just mastered the sport of curling, beating two Korean national teams. Building a robot to fire stones down a length of ice might sound eccentric, I’ll grant that, but rather than simply paving the way to the All Robot Winter Olympics of 2026, Curly is actually a big achievement in machine intelligence, one that could have implications for robotics beyond the rink.
Curling requires a mix of the physicality of bowling and the strategy of chess. Shoving off from a peg in the ice, a player called the “thrower” gently slides a puck made of granite, known as a stone, releasing it before a boundary called the “hogline.” The stone glides over 100 feet down the rink to the target, known as the “house.” An opposing team does the same, so both teams accumulate stones in the same house. At the end of the round, the team with a stone closest to the center of the target gets a point. If that team has extra stones closer to the center than the opposing team, those tally additional points.
The physicality of curling lies in the incredible precision required to set a stone on its course before releasing it at the hogline, giving it a spin to make it hook left or right while putting enough force behind it to land it in the house. The strategy comes from making sure your opponent doesn’t instead get their stones closest to the center of the house. For instance, a team can give a stone enough oomph to both bump out one of the other team’s stones, and with that collision halt their own stone on the target.
In other words, it’s one of the most delicate and methodical sports in the world. And it’s even trickier to teach a robot how to do it well. “All of that together is really a fantastic challenge that is not only special for curling, but it's I think a general challenge for all the AIs that go into the real world,” says Klaus-Robert Müller, a machine-learning researcher at Korea University, the Berlin Institute of Technology, and the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, and coauthor on a new paper in Science Robotics describing the system.
So, Curly has a lot of work cut out for it. The robot is shaped a bit like a flattened teardrop, with two wheels up front and one caster in the rear. (It’s difficult enough for a human to walk on ice, much less a humanoid robot, hence Curly’s wheels.) It’s equipped with two cameras, one that telescopes 7 feet high to give the robot a view of the house, and another on its face just above the front wheels to watch for the hogline. Curly grasps the stone between those front wheels using four smaller wheels arranged in a U shape. These are powered by a conveyor belt, which spins the stone, allowing the robot to curve its trajectory, just like a human player does. Spin clockwise and the stone will curl right; spin counterclockwise and it’ll go left.
That’s the bowling side of things—now for the chess. The researchers couldn’t just put Curly out on the rink and have it experiment with different throws, like a human would do to master the sport. This is, in general, a massive problem in robotics: It takes way too long for a machine to learn by trial and error in the real world, and it’s liable to hurt itself by trying some far-fetched maneuver and falling over. So instead, the team built a simulation of a curling game for a digital version of Curly to play around in. In this simulation, the researchers approximated the physics of the real world as best they could, but they were also missing some information because of the peculiar physics of curling.
“The unique thing about this sport is that the stones and the ice are actually changing all the time,” says Scott Arnold, head of development at the World Curling Federation, which was not involved in the research. (And which, by the way, does not seem to be threatened by our new robotic curling overlords.) “As a stone progresses through its life span, the bottom of it is actually polishing itself out all the time. So the interaction between the stone and the ice is changing every time you throw it.” Each stone—being a natural product made out of … stone—has its own quirks, too.
Imperfection is also built into the ice on purpose; what appears to be a smooth sheet of ice when you’re watching curling in the Olympics is in fact somewhat rough. A curling stone’s bottom surface is shaped like a cup, so if the ice was actually perfectly smooth, the stone would form suction and not move at all. Instead, crews sprinkle water on the frozen surface, forming tiny “pebbles.” When the stone sits on the pebbled surface, air gets under it and cancels that suction.
No two ice sheets have ever been laid down the exact same way, both because of this random bumpiness, and because of the quality of the water used, which can affect the way the liquid hardens into a surface. Accordingly, human curlers are allowed to take practice throws before a match to get a feel for the ice. All that imperfection only grows more chaotic as the game goes on, as the friction from the stones modifies the ice.
The equations in the researchers' curling simulation do their best to approximate the physics of ice, but they’re not perfectly correct. “And so there's a gap between simulation and reality,” says Müller. “One of the things that we first do is we train the robot, or the AI, to reflect the physics model, but the physics model is erroneous.” That is, a kind of uncertainty is built into the system to reflect the uncertainty that the robot will face in a real-world game. Humans deal with this uncertainty by taking those test throws before a match. Curly does this, too, essentially aligning its mathematical models with real-world experience. “We can also use the test throws to gauge or re-adapt the physics-trained model to the reality, overcoming this gap,” Müller adds.
Upload that knowledge into the real robot’s brain and Curly can master curling without much exertion at all. With that telescoping camera, it looks over the house and contemplates its move. “So you detect the stones, you think about where to put the stone, then you compute all the possible throws with the physics model. Then you compensate and see where this stone would go, and what the possible variants would be,” Müller says.
Müller and his colleagues trained Curly so well that it beat pro Korean teams in three of four official matches. But keep in mind, this wasn’t an exact replication of what you’d see in the Olympics, as Curly can’t sweep. When you see a human thrower’s teammates scoot ahead of the stone with brooms, scrubbing the ice, they’re reducing friction and making the stone curve less, forcing it to tack a straighter course.
Like a cannon operator missing the first shot, then readjusting a few degrees left or right and firing again, Curly can correct its mistake. The robot has an added challenge, because its previously thrown stones have altered the ice that subsequent stones will slide over—a cannon operator doesn’t have to worry about previous shells altering the air. Yet the robot can still correct its mistakes.
And that’s a critical skill for any robot. As machines grow more advanced and find more real-world applications, they’ll frustrate the hell out of us if they remain as unadaptable and rigid as bread sticks. Just as Curly learns from its practice throws, so too must other robots adapt to the chaos of a home, office, or street, and not just stubbornly try things that no longer work. There’s no Olympic gold medal for property destruction, after all.",Techcrunch,Wired,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document:

**Robots Take on Curling: Meet Curly, the AI-Powered Stone Thrower**

If you're not familiar with curling, it's essentially ice bocce – and it's a blast. But beneath its entertaining surface lies a complex game that requires precision and strategy. That's why researchers from Korea University in Seoul and the Berlin Institute of Technology created Curly, a robot capable of throwing the stone with national-level proficiency.

Curly is more than just a single robot – it's a team of two. One robot observes the position of the stones at the scoring end, while the other does the actual throwing. And despite lacking a robot sweeper or yeller, Curly's advanced AI system makes up for it.

Trained entirely on computer simulations, Curly's AI was put to the test in the real world. The results were impressive: against top women's teams and the national wheelchair team, Curly won three out of four rounds. The next step? Maybe permitting sweepers to see how it affects the outcome.

What makes Curly's achievement remarkable is that it demonstrates both AI and robotic prowess in a highly dynamic, real-world scenario. The robot can't retrain its network mid-game; it needs to adapt and make decisions on the fly. This win is significant not just for robotics and AI but also for the prospect of training robots in simulated environments – a major breakthrough.

In the realm of robotics, Curly is breaking new ground – literally. This Korean-made curling robot has mastered the art of sliding a heavy kettle-shaped stone across the ice, earning it a spot among the nation's top teams.

If you've never had the pleasure of curling, imagine a game of ice bocce, where the objective is to strategically slide your stone closer to the center of the target than your opponents'. The subtlety lies in judging the power, angle, and spin required to outmaneuver your competition. That's precisely what Curly excels at, outperforming even some of the country's leading women's teams and the national wheelchair team.

The two-robot system, devised by researchers from Korea University and the Berlin Institute of Technology, was designed to test the interaction between an AI system and a dynamically changing real-world scenario. In other words, Curly can observe its surroundings, adapt, and make precise decisions in real-time.

What's impressive is that Curly's AI was trained entirely on simulated games, yet it still manages to excel in the real world. This achievement marks a significant milestone, demonstrating that AI can be successfully trained in simulated environments and then applied to complex, dynamic situations.

The robot's prowess is not limited to its throwing skills. Its AI system can also account for varying ice conditions, requiring only a single throw at the beginning of each game to adjust its strategy. This adaptability has earned Curly a winning streak, taking down three out of four rounds against stiff competition.

The significance of Curly's achievements extends beyond the realm of robotics and AI. It showcases the potential of training robots in simulated environments, a development that could have far-reaching implications for industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and more.

For the full story on Curly and its cutting-edge AI, check out the latest issue of Science Robotics.","Here is the rewritten source document in the style of the reference document from Wired:

In the realm of robotics, a new champion has emerged: Curly, a robot designed to excel at the precision sport of curling. Researchers from Korea University in Seoul and the Berlin Institute of Technology have created a machine that can throw the stone with uncanny accuracy, rivaling the skills of national-level competitors.

For the uninitiated, curling may seem like a straightforward game, but it requires a delicate balance of power, angle, and spin to navigate the stone towards the target. Curly's creators have successfully replicated this complex motion, allowing the robot to gauge the optimal throw with precision.

But Curly is more than just a one-trick pony. The robot is, in fact, a duo of machines: one observes the stone's position at the scoring end, while the other executes the throw. This synergy enables Curly to adapt to changing conditions, such as varying ice slickness, with remarkable ease.

The researchers' innovative approach lies in training Curly's AI solely through computer simulations, where the stone and ice are digitally recreated. This unorthodox method has yielded impressive results, allowing Curly to dominate three out of four rounds against top-tier women's teams and the national wheelchair team.

What's more, Curly's success has significant implications for AI and robotics. By demonstrating the ability to observe and respond to dynamic real-world scenarios in real-time, Curly has pushed the boundaries of what's possible in simulated training environments.

As the researchers point out, this achievement is not just a novelty, but a testament to the potential of AI and robotics in tackling complex, high-stakes challenges. You can delve deeper into the intricacies of Curly's AI and engineering in the latest issue of Science Robotics.

1.0,"Facebook today formally announced its new feature that allows users to order food from local restaurants using its app. Instead of competing directly with other food ordering services, Facebook is partnering with several industry players on this effort, including EatStreet, Delivery.com, DoorDash, ChowNow, Olo, Zuppler and Slice. It’s also working with restaurant chains directly, like Jack in the Box, Five Guys, Papa John’s, Wingstop, TGI Friday’s, Denny’s, El Pollo Loco, Chipotle, Jimmy John’s and Panera.
Users can find the new option “Order Food” in the Explore menu in the Facebook app, where you can then browse area restaurants and click “Start Order” when you know what you want.
Orders can be placed for either take-out or delivery, and if you already have a Delivery.com account, you can use your existing login. If not, you’ll be able to sign up for a Delivery.com account directly in the Facebook app, the company says.
In addition, you’ll be able to read reviews from friends about the restaurant in question, to help you make your decision.
Facebook has been developing a deeper relationship with food ordering businesses for some time. Last fall, it announced a deal with online ordering services Delivery.com and Slice, which allowed Facebook users to place orders from supported restaurants through their own Facebook Pages.
Earlier this year, TechCrunch reported this “Order Food” feature was in testing as a new option from within the Explore menu in the app. Facebook, at the time, confirmed it was an expansion of its previous “Order Food” functionality via the Facebook Pages. The idea was to see if adding an entry point through Facebook’s main navigation could increase the usage for the food ordering feature.
The company, however, did not comment on how long the option had been live, or what percentage of Facebook users had it available.
Today, Facebook confirms that the Order Food option has been in testing since last year, and, after adding more partners and responding to user feedback, it’s rolling out across the U.S. to all users on iOS, Android and desktop.
The move to introduce food ordering is one that allows Facebook to keep users inside its app for longer periods, instead of seeing users exit to other apps for common tasks, like ordering a pizza.
The company has been rolling out several other features with that same goal, including things like weather info, instant games, a jobs board, fundraisers, movie listings, booking appointments and getting quotes and more.
However, “Order Food” is not a direct revenue driver for Facebook. The company confirmed that it doesn’t charge any fees, or share in any portion of the profits from the orders placed via its social network.","Today Facebook is announcing that users can now order food for takeout or delivery using both the Facebook mobile app and website. But it’s not at all what you might think; Facebook hasn’t created its own answer to Seamless, which would be massive news for the restaurant industry. This isn’t that.
Instead, the company is partnering with existing services GrubHub, Delivery.com, DoorDash, ChowNow, Zuppler, EatStreet, Slice, and Olo, and will now link out to those food ordering businesses for restaurants that support them. You head to the new “Order Food” area of Facebook under the Explore section, find the local spot you’re craving, and then hit “start order.” From there, if a restaurant supports more than one of Facebook’s ordering partners, you’ll be able to choose between them. Once you do, Facebook will bring up an in-app browser that takes you through the existing websites for Delivery.com and the others. That’s where all the ordering actually happens, so you’re not actually doing much with the Facebook app beyond finding a restaurant and tapping your preferred delivery option.
Seamless is not currently among Facebook’s partner services, but parent company GrubHub is, so that should get you most of the same delivery restaurants. But there are other omissions such as Caviar, so you’ll still need to open those apps separately to know which restaurants use them and place an order.
Facebook is also partnering on food ordering directly with national chains Chipotle, Five Guys, Jack in the Box, Papa John's, Wingstop, Panera, TGI Friday's, Denny's, El Pollo Loco, and Jimmy John's. But it works the same way as with the other services; you browse to one of these nearby chain locations, pick start order, and then you’ll be sent to their existing delivery system. All Facebook is really doing here is launching an in-app browser so you can get a meal without ever leaving the app.
That “we’ve been working on this for a year” bit surprised me. There’s certainly some work necessary to link all these restaurant pages with the services they use (and businesses can opt out of displaying the food ordering feature if they wish). The value for Facebook is obvious; the company hopes you’ll fill your craving and then keep swiping through your news feed with your greasy fingers.
But if you’re left asking why you wouldn’t just use an app from these services or chains to begin with, I don’t have a great answer for why Facebook’s little shortcut would be better. It’s ever so slightly faster if you’re already on Facebook, I suppose — and good exposure for some of the services that users might not already be familiar with.",Techcrunch,Theverge,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document:

Instead of competing directly with established food ordering services, Facebook is partnering with EatStreet, Delivery.com, DoorDash, ChowNow, Olo, Zuppler, and Slice to offer users a seamless food ordering experience.

This new feature, dubbed ""Order Food,"" allows users to browse local restaurants in the Explore menu, select their preferred option, and initiate an order. Users can choose between take-out and delivery, and existing Delivery.com account holders can log in seamlessly. New users, meanwhile, can sign up for a Delivery.com account directly within the Facebook app.

To aid users in their decision-making process, Facebook is also incorporating reviews from friends who have dined at the selected restaurant. This feature builds upon Facebook's existing partnership with food ordering businesses, which began last fall with a deal to integrate ordering capabilities into Facebook Pages.

Earlier this year, Facebook began testing the ""Order Food"" feature in a limited capacity, with plans to expand the service to a wider audience. Today, the company confirms that the feature has been in development since last year and is now available to all users on iOS, Android, and desktop platforms across the United States.

Facebook's move into food ordering is part of its broader strategy to increase user engagement and reduce the need for users to exit the app for common tasks. The company has introduced a range of features aimed at achieving this goal, including weather information, instant games, a jobs board, fundraisers, movie listings, and booking appointments.

Facebook's Latest Feature: Ordering Food Without Leaving the App

Just in time for lunch, Facebook has officially launched its new feature that lets users order food from local restaurants directly within the app. But instead of going head-to-head with existing food delivery services, Facebook has partnered with industry heavyweights like EatStreet, Delivery.com, and DoorDash to bring this functionality to life.

The new ""Order Food"" option is nestled in the Explore menu, where users can browse through local restaurants and click ""Start Order"" when they've found their perfect meal. Orders can be placed for either pickup or delivery, and users with existing Delivery.com accounts can seamlessly log in and continue their order. If you're new to Delivery.com, you can sign up directly within the Facebook app.

But here's the twist: Facebook isn't just about facilitating food orders – it's also letting users read reviews from friends to help inform their dining decisions. It's a clever move that leverages Facebook's social network to make food ordering more social and personalized.

Facebook has been testing the waters with food ordering for a while now, having announced a partnership with Delivery.com and Slice last fall. The company has been quietly expanding this feature, and after adding more partners and responding to user feedback, it's finally rolling out to all users in the US on iOS, Android, and desktop.

So why is Facebook getting into the food ordering game? It's all about keeping users inside the app for longer periods of time. By offering a range of services like weather information, instant games, a jobs board, and now food ordering, Facebook is trying to become the ultimate one-stop shop for its users.

But here's the interesting bit: Facebook isn't taking a cut of the profits from these food orders. The company confirmed that it doesn't charge any fees or share in any portion of the profits, which raises questions about the true motivation behind this feature.

1.0,"One the same day as Fortnite maker Epic Games goes to trial with one of the biggest legal challenges to the App Store’s business model to date, it has simultaneously announced the acquisition of the artist portfolio community ArtStation — and immediately lowered the commissions on sales. Now standard creators on ArtStation will see the same 12% commission rate found in Epic’s own Games Store for PCs, instead of the 30% it was before. This reduced rate is meant to serve as an example to the wider community as to what a “reasonable” commission should look like. This could become a point of comparison with the Apple App Store’s 30% commission for larger developers like Epic as the court case proceeds.
ArtStation today offers a place for creators across gaming, media and entertainment to showcase their work and find new jobs. The company has had a long relationship with Epic Games, as many ArtStation creators work with Epic’s Unreal Engine. However, ArtStation has also been a home to 2D and 3D creators across verticals, including those who don’t work with Unreal Engine.
The acquisition won’t change that, the team says in its announcement. Instead, the deal will expand the opportunities for creators to monetize their work. Most notably, that involves the commission drop. For standard creators, the fees will drop from 30% to 12%. For Pro members (who pay $9.95/mo for a subscription), the commission goes even lower — from 20% to 8%. And for self-promoted sales, the fees will be just 5%. ArtEngine’s streaming video service, ArtStation Learning, will also be free for the rest of 2021, the company notes.
The slashed commission, however, is perhaps the most important change Epic is making to ArtStation because it gives Epic a specific example as to how it treats its own creator communities. It will likely reference the acquisition and the commission changes during its trial with Apple, along with its own Epic Games Store and its similarly low rate. Already, Epic’s move had prompted Microsoft to lower its cut on game sales, too, having recently announced a similar 30% to 12% drop.
In the trial, Epic Games will try to argue that Apple has a monopoly on the iOS app ecosystem and it abuses its market power to force developers to use Apple’s payment systems and pay it commissions on the sales and in-app purchases that flow through those systems. Epic Games, like several other larger app makers, would rather use its own payment systems to avoid the commission — or at the very least, be able to point users to a website where they can pay directly. But Apple doesn’t allow this, per its App Store guidelines.
Last year, Epic Games triggered Fortnite’s App Store expulsion by introducing a new direct way to pay on mobile devices, which offered a steep discount. It was a calculated move. Both Apple and Google immediately banned the game for violating their respective app store policies, as a result. And then Epic sued.
While Epic’s fight is technically with both Apple and Google, it has focused more of its energy on the former because Android devices allow sideloading of apps (a means of installing apps directly), and Apple does not.
Meanwhile, Apple’s argument is that Epic Games agreed to Apple’s terms and guidelines and then purposefully violated them in an effort to get a special deal. But Apple says the guidelines apply to all developers equally, and Epic doesn’t get an exception here.
However, throughout the course of the U.S. antitrust investigations into big tech, it was discovered that Apple did, in fact, make special deals in the past. Emails shared by the House Judiciary Committee as a part of an investigation revealed that Apple had agreed to a 15% commission for Amazon’s Prime Video app at the start, when typically subscription video apps are 30% in year one, then 15% in year two and beyond. (Apple says Amazon simply qualified for a new program.) Plus, other older emails revealed Apple had several discussions about raising commissions even higher than 30%, indicating that Apple believed its commission rate had some flex.
Ahead of today’s acquisition by Epic Games, ArtStation received a “Megagrant” from Epic during the height of the pandemic to help it through an uncertain period. This may have pushed the two companies to further discuss deeper ties going forward.","As it prepares to do battle in court with Apple over App Store fees, Epic Games has acquired ArtStation, an online marketplace for digital artists, the companies announced. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.
Founded in 2014, ArtStation is a popular portfolio site for professional artists in gaming and entertainment. ArtStation artists can also sell their work on the site, and Epic plans to reduce seller fees, putting more money in creators’ pockets. Standard fees will go from 30 percent to 12 percent, and for ArtStation Pro members, the fees will be reduced from 20 percent to 8 percent, and 5 percent for self-promoted sales.
ArtStation will continue to operate “as an independently branded platform,” and its ArtStation Learning section, which has a library of educational videos, will be free for the rest of 2021.
“You can still use the platform as you do today, and we will continue to be open to all creators across verticals, both 2D and 3D alike—including those that don’t use Unreal Engine,” ArtStation CEO Leonard Teo wrote in a blog post. “We’ll be actively hiring and growing the ArtStation team. We’re committed to improving the platform and now as a part of Epic, we’ll be able to do much more.” Leo added that Epic’s Unreal Engine team has been a strong supporter of the platform, with Epic giving ArtStation one of its Megagrants last year at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.",Techcrunch,Theverge,"Epic Games Acquires ArtStation, Slashes Commissions Ahead of Apple Trial

The move was calculated, and both Apple and Google immediately banned the game from their respective app stores. Epic sued, arguing that Apple's guidelines are unfair and should be changed.

While Epic's fight is technically with both Apple and Google, it has focused most of its energy on Apple because Android devices allow sideloading of apps, while Apple does not. Apple, meanwhile, argues that Epic agreed to its terms and guidelines and then purposefully violated them in an effort to get a special deal.

However, emails shared by the House Judiciary Committee during the U.S. antitrust investigations into big tech revealed that Apple did, in fact, make special deals in the past. For example, Apple agreed to a 15% commission for Amazon's Prime Video app, and had discussions about raising commissions even higher than 30%.

Ahead of today's acquisition, ArtStation received a ""Megagrant"" from Epic during the height of the pandemic to help it through an uncertain period. That may have pushed the two companies to further discuss deeper ties going forward.

The acquisition, and the subsequent commission drop, is a bold move by Epic Games, and one that's likely to have far-reaching implications for the digital creative community. As the trial with Apple gets underway, it'll be interesting to see how this move is referenced, and what kind of impact it has on the broader conversation around app store business models.","Here is the rewritten source document in the style of The Verge:

Epic Games just dropped a bombshell on the same day it's heading to trial with Apple over the App Store's business model. The Fortnite maker has acquired ArtStation, a community platform for artists and creators, and is immediately slashing commissions on sales. Standard creators on ArtStation will now see a 12% commission rate, down from 30%, matching the rate found in Epic's own Games Store for PCs. This move is meant to showcase what a ""reasonable"" commission looks like, and it could become a point of comparison with Apple's 30% commission for larger developers like Epic as the court case unfolds.

ArtStation has long been a hub for creators across gaming, media, and entertainment to showcase their work and find new opportunities. The platform has had a close relationship with Epic Games, given the many ArtStation creators who work with Epic's Unreal Engine. However, ArtStation has also been a home to 2D and 3D creators across various verticals, including those who don't work with Unreal Engine. The acquisition won't change that, the team says. Instead, it will expand the opportunities for creators to monetize their work.

The most notable change is the commission drop. For standard creators, fees will plummet from 30% to 12%. For Pro members (who pay $9.95/mo for a subscription), the commission will drop even lower, from 20% to 8%. And for self-promoted sales, the fees will be a mere 5%. ArtStation's streaming video service, ArtStation Learning, will also be free for the rest of 2021, the company notes.

This slashed commission is perhaps the most important change Epic is making to ArtStation, as it gives Epic a concrete example of how it treats its own creator communities. It will likely reference the acquisition and commission changes during its trial with Apple, alongside its own Epic Games Store and its similarly low rate. Already, Epic's move has prompted Microsoft to lower its cut on game sales, too, having recently announced a similar 30% to 12% drop.

In the trial, Epic Games will argue that Apple has a monopoly on the iOS app ecosystem and abuses its market power to force developers to use Apple's payment systems and pay it commissions on sales and in-app purchases. Epic Games, like several other larger app makers, would rather use its own payment systems to avoid the commission – or at the very least, be able to point users to a website where they can pay directly. But Apple doesn't allow this, per its App Store guidelines.

Last year, Epic Games triggered Fortnite's App Store expulsion by introducing a new direct way to pay on mobile devices, which offered a steep discount. It was a calculated move. Both Apple and Google immediately banned the game for violating their respective app store policies, as a result. And then Epic sued.

While Epic's fight is technically with both Apple and Google, it has focused more of its energy on the former because Android devices allow sideloading of apps (a means of installing apps directly), and Apple does not.

Meanwhile, Apple's argument is that Epic Games agreed to Apple's terms and guidelines and then purposefully violated them in an effort to get a special deal. But Apple says the guidelines apply to all developers equally, and Epic doesn't get an exception here.

However, throughout the course of the U.S. antitrust investigations into big tech, it was discovered that Apple did, in fact, make special deals in the past. Emails shared by the House Judiciary Committee as part of an investigation revealed that Apple had agreed to a 15% commission for Amazon's Prime Video app at the start, when typically subscription video apps are 30% in year one, then 15% in year two and beyond. (Apple says Amazon simply qualified for a new program.) Plus, other older emails revealed Apple had several discussions about raising commissions even higher than 30%, indicating that Apple believed its commission rate had some flex.

1.0,"If you've ever been one of the early viewers of a popular YouTube video, you've probably seen it: ""301+ views."" ""301+"" is the view count YouTube pauses popular videos at so that it can separate the spam bots from the real viewers. Today, however, the video site announced that ""301+"" will be going away soon—it's changing the way view counts work to be closer to real-time.
On less popular videos, every view is counted as a view, but for popular ones, YouTube doesn't want people gaming the view counter, so it pauses the view count. After 300 views, a verification system would kick in and pause the view counter for ""a few hours"" according to YouTube's little infographic. The new system will immediately count views YouTube is ""confident"" come from real people and will direct questionable hits to the old hours-long view verification process. The result is that you should never see the ""301+ views"" message once this is rolled out.
For a single video, YouTube has to collect video views from multiple servers from all around the world, making tallying the view count more complicated than it might seem. The view verification system ensures that videos that look popular are actually popular with real people, not just someone with a bot net spamming video clicks. YouTube also only wants a ""view"" to count not just as a video click, but as a happy viewer that watched most of the video. If YouTube detects that users click away from a video after a few seconds, like from a totally misleading thumbnail and description, it doesn't count those clicks as views.
In an interview with the YouTube channel Numberphile, YouTube Analytics Product Manager Ted Hamilton gave an explanation of why YouTube cares so much. ""We think of views as a currency, and therefore we have to make a significant effort to eliminate counterfeit views."" YouTube also pays out a lot of money for ads, and a ton of views could get a video promoted to the front page, giving spammers lots of incentives to try to beat the system. So while it might seem silly to outsiders, YouTube views are serious business.","YouTube videos' view counter famously gets stuck at ""301+"" views, but that beautifully ambiguous state is going away forever. YouTube announced this morning that it's doing away with 301+ and will start to keep video views more up to date. It's long frozen the counter after 301 so that it can take some time to filter out any fake views from robots, but doing so has meant keeping the counter really imprecise while thousands of legitimate views come in.
YouTube says that it'll now continue to add new views as they happen, as long as it's sure that they're genuine; views that YouTube suspects as coming from bots will be added later if they're cleared. This should help video creators get a better perception of how their video is doing early on, but mostly, it'll mean viewers saying goodbye to knowing that a video is brand new because it's stuck at 301+.",Arstechnica,Theverge,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document:

YouTube is overhauling its view count system to provide a more accurate reflection of engagement on its platform. The oft-noticed ""301+ views"" placeholder will soon be a thing of the past, as the video site introduces a new real-time counting system to separate authentic views from spam.

On lesser-watched videos, every view is counted as is, but for popular ones, YouTube has historically paused the count to prevent view counter manipulation. After reaching 300 views, a verification process would kick in, pausing the count for several hours, according to YouTube's infographic. The revamped system will immediately tally views deemed legitimate and direct suspicious traffic to the existing hours-long verification process. As a result, users should no longer encounter the ""301+ views"" message once the update is rolled out.

Tallying view counts is more complicated than it seems, as YouTube must aggregate data from multiple servers worldwide for a single video. The verification system ensures that popular videos are genuinely popular among real users, rather than bots. A view is only counted if a user watches a significant portion of the video, preventing misleading thumbnails and descriptions from artificially inflating view counts.

In an interview with YouTube channel Numberphile, YouTube Analytics Product Manager Ted Hamilton explained why accurate view counts are crucial.

Reddit bans QAnon subreddit for content policy violations, citing “repeated violations of the terms of our content policy”

Reddit has taken down the r/greatawakening subreddit, citing content policy violations as the reason for the ban. The subreddit, which had over 70,000 subscribers, was dedicated to promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory.

According to a Reddit representative, the platform has clear rules against posting content that incites violence, disseminates personal information, or harasses others. “We are very clear in our site terms of service that posting content that incites violence, disseminates personal information, or harasses will get users and communities banned from Reddit,” the representative said.

For those who may not be familiar, QAnon is a conspiracy theory that emerged on 4chan's far-right /pol/ message board in October 2017. The theory claims that a mysterious figure named ""Q"" has insider knowledge about the government and is working to take down the so-called ""Deep State."" The theory has gained popularity among some supporters of President Donald Trump, with some believing that a multibillion-dollar cement company and Tom Hanks are involved in child sex trafficking and pedophilia.

The ban is likely to spark controversy, given the subreddit's large following and the fervor of its supporters. However, Reddit's decision is clear: the platform will not tolerate content that violates its terms of service.

It's worth noting that Reddit's ban is not a blanket condemnation of QAnon or its supporters. Rather, it's a specific response to the subreddit's repeated violations of the platform's content policy. Whether or not you agree with Reddit's decision, it's hard to deny that the platform has a responsibility to uphold its own rules and protect its users from harmful or offensive content.

It's also worth noting that the QAnon conspiracy theory is not supported by credible evidence, and its claims have been repeatedly debunked by experts and fact-checkers. While the theory may have a dedicated following, it's essential to approach such claims with a healthy dose of skepticism and to rely on credible sources of information.","Here is the rewritten source document in the style of The Verge:

Reddit Bans QAnon Subreddit for Content Policy Violations

On Wednesday, Reddit took down the subreddit r/greatawakening, citing repeated violations of its content policy. The ban comes as the QAnon conspiracy theory continues to gain traction among supporters of President Donald Trump.

According to a Reddit representative, the company is clear in its site terms of service that posting content that incites violence, disseminates personal information, or harasses will result in users and communities being banned from the platform.

QAnon, which began in October 2017, has become a popular conspiracy theory among Trump supporters. The theory alleges that a multibillion-dollar cement company and Tom Hanks are involved in child sex trafficking and pedophilia, and that Trump and special counsel Robert Mueller are working to take down the so-called Deep State.

The theory originated on 4chan's far-right /pol/ message board, where a user going by the name ""Q"" claimed to possess insight into the inner workings of the American government.

At the time of its ban, r/greatawakening had over 70,000 subscribers, according to Digg.

Reddit's decision to ban the subreddit is likely to be seen as a move to curb the spread of misinformation and harmful content on its platform. The company has faced criticism in the past for its handling of controversial subreddits, and this ban is likely to be seen as a step in the right direction.

1.0,"Fujifilm is trying to beat Sony at its own game with the launch of the 26-megapixel X-S20, a content creation-oriented camera. Though it has a similar body and the same sensor as its predecessor, the X-S10, it offers some major improvements in terms of video quality and more. At the same time, it's considerably more expensive than the X-S10 was at launch.
""X-S20 is truly a dream camera for any content creator looking to take their photos and videos creation to the next level, but especially for the ones that are documenting their lives, traveling the world, or streaming their stories online,” said Fujifilm's Lisa Baxt, essentially describing the camera's market and purpose.
Though it has the same last-generation 26-megapixel X-Trans sensor as the X-S10, it uses the company's new X-Processor 5. That allowed Fujifilm to install its latest deep learning AI autofocus technology that boosts speeds and allows the camera to detect animals, birds, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, trains, insects and drones, much like the higher-end X-H2 and X-T5. Plus, it can detect all of those automatically, so the user doesn't need to pick a subject before shooting.
That also boosted the camera's video powers considerably. Where the X-S10 was limited to 4K 30p 10-bit video, the X-S20 can shoot 6.2K 4:2:2 10-bit open gate video that can be cropped into any horizontal or vertical format you want. It can also handle DCI 4K at 60 fps and super slow-mo 1080/240p video. In addition, it supports F-Log2 with up to 13-plus stops of dynamic range (DR), where the X-S10 was limited to F-Log with a stop less DR.
It offers a much higher 360Mbps bit-rate thanks to support for faster UHS-II cards, though there's still only a single card slot. You can also record 12-bit Apple ProRes and Blackmagic RAW video at 6.2K 30p and 5.2K/30p externally, either to Atomos or Blackmagic recorders. Finally, Fujifilm is offering an optional external cooling fan that allows for 6.2K video recording for up to 80 minutes, compared to 40 minutes without the fan.
Fujifilm flattered Sony by imitation with its dedicated ""Vlog"" function on the mode dial. This new setting gives you direct access to a vlogging touch menu that offers functions like product priority focus mode, background defocus, high-speed recording, face/eye detection and more. Much like Sony's V-series models, product priority mode disables face/eye detection so the camera will focus on a product placed in front of it, while background defocus opens the lens aperture as wide as possible for more background blur.
Also new is UVC/UAC support that lets the camera work directly as a webcam by just plugging it into your PC. You can also stream 4K/60p video live online using OBS studio.
For photography, the X-S20 can fire bursts at up to 8 frame per second in mechanical shutter mode, or 20 fps in electronic mode. The buffer supports over 1,000 JPEG or compressed RAW images in mechanical mode — considerably more than before. However, it's limited to 35 frames for uncompressed RAW images, about double the X-S10. In electronic mode, the buffer can handle 79 compressed RAW images before filling, or 28 uncompressed RAW shots.
As before, it comes with five-axis in-body stabilization, though Fujifilm has boosted the power from six stops to seven with supported lenses. It also has a fully articulating 3-inch display, with resolution boosted to 1.84 million dots, up from 1.04 million. The OLED electronic viewfinder has 2.36 million dots of resolution and a 100 fps refresh.
It retains much the same body design with a slightly larger grip, and 491 gram weight that's a touch heavier — but it's still pretty light for such a powerful camera. Other features include microphone/headphone and HDMI micro ports, and yes, the pop-up flash is back.
The X-S20 is priced at $1,300 (body) only, which is considerably more than the $1,000 launch price of the X-S10. You can also grab it in a kit with XC15-45mm f/3.5-5.6 lens for $1,400, or with the XF18-55mm f/2.8-4 lens for $1,700. Shipping starts on June 29th.
Along with the camera, Fujifilm unveiled the XApp designed to control X- and GFX-series camera for remote shooting, file transfers and more. The company said it ""listened carefully to user feedback"" when developing the app, so here's hoping it's a large step up from the previous (dreadful) app. Fujifilm also unveiled the ultra-wide-angle XF8mmF3.5 lens ($800) shipping on or around June 29th, 2023.","Fujifilm has just announced a new camera in its X-series mirrorless lineup, the X-S10. The new model is a bit of a departure from Fujifilm’s other cameras, and features a control scheme that’ll be familiar to shooters of other camera systems. It also has plenty of vlogger-friendly features, including a fully articulating display, in-body image stabilization, and a microphone input.
The X-S10 will be available starting in November for $999.95 without a lens. It will also be kitted with a 18-55 f/2.8-4 lens for $1,399.95, or a 16-80 f/4 lens for $1,499.95.
Unlike Fujifilm’s other cameras, such as the X-T4, X-T3, or X-T30, the X-S10 does away with the traditional shutter speed, ISO, and exposure compensation dials in favor of a mode dial and front and rear command dials, like many Canon, Nikon, and Sony cameras have. It also has an unlabeled dial on the left shoulder for switching between the X-S10’s 18 film simulations. This setup will be foreign to existing Fujifilm owners, but it may make the camera more appealing to those coming from other systems.
The X-S10 also features a prominent grip, which is larger than found on most prior Fujifilm cameras. The grip makes it easier to hold the camera one-handed and removes the need to add accessories to beef up the handling. Sadly, the grip isn’t large enough to accommodate the X-T4’s larger battery — the X-S10 uses the same 1,260mAh W126S battery found in many older Fujifilm cameras. It also gives up the dual SD card slots found on the higher-end models and makes do with a single UHS-I slot.
Like the X-T4, Fujifilm is pitching the X-S10 as a hybrid camera, meaning it should appeal to both still photographers and video shooters. It has the same 26.1-megapixel X-Trans IV CMOS sensor, X-Processor 4, and autofocus system as the X-T3 and X-T4, but it doesn’t quite match those models in terms of video capabilities. The X-S10 can shoot 4:2:2 10-bit 4K video at 30 frames per second, but only to an external recorder — internal recording is limited to 4:2:0 8-bit. It does retain video features such as high-speed full HD video at 240fps, F-Log, and zebras, however.
Fujifilm says the five-axis in-body image stabilization (IBIS) system in the X-S10 is both 30 percent smaller and 30 percent lighter than the one used in the X-T4. That allows the camera itself to be more compact, but it gives up about half a stop of shake compensation compared to the X-T4, maxing out at 6 stops.
The X-S10’s microphone jack is mounted above the articulating touchscreen’s hinge, so a microphone cable won’t block the view of the screen when it’s flipped around, but there’s no headphone jack. A USB-C to 3.5mm adapter is included in the box to monitor audio, though the USB-C port does block the screen when it’s flipped around.
As a lower-tier model than the $1,600 X-T4, the X-S10 includes a handful of improvements to its autoexposure modes. A new feature will allow the camera to automatically choose between Provia, Velvia, and Astia film simulations, depending on the context of the shot, while the Shooting Priority Auto setting allows you to tell the camera what kind of scene you’re shooting and let it take it from there. You can also now capture RAW images in addition to JPEGs in the auto modes, something you couldn’t do on other Fujifilm cameras.
I had an opportunity to briefly use a pre-production X-S10 ahead of today’s announcement. As someone who’s shot with Fujifilm cameras for nearly a decade for both professional and personal work, I found the X-S10’s control scheme off-putting and longed to have my shutter speed and exposure compensation dials back. I also found the camera to not be as customizable as I’d like — instead of seven custom modes, there are only four, and the top left shoulder dial was limited to just adjusting the film simulation, which isn’t something I need a dial dedicated to.
But I’m not the target market for the X-S10; that’s the millions of people who are shooting with Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, or Sony cameras who may have shied away from Fujifilm cameras before. Those shooters might not have liked Fujifilm’s throwback control system, or they may have a style of shooting that works better with front and rear command dials. Or maybe they are vloggers, which I am decidedly not, and want something that can be held out at arm’s length and produce a steady shot.
Based on my conversations with Fujifilm representatives, it does seem like the X-S10 is the first in a new line of cameras from the company, and isn’t likely to be a one-off. If it does become a hit, the company will likely follow it up with a successor or a higher-end version — the naming format leaves “X-S1” wide open for that potential model. But I was told the traditional Fujifilm cameras aren’t going anywhere, and the X-S10 does not replace models like the X-T30 or the X-T4.
Fujifilm is jumping into a competitive space, though, as Sony, Canon, and Panasonic all have released models tailored to aspiring vloggers this year. The X-S10 is better equipped than all of those models, and Fujifilm has made strides in improving the video recording capabilities of its cameras over the years, but we’ll have to see whether or not it becomes a vlogger favorite like Sony or Panasonic.",Engadget,Theverge,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document:

Fujifilm's latest attempt to take down Sony with the X-S20 camera feels more like a desperate imitation than innovation. This new content creation powerhouse is essentially a souped-up version of its predecessor, the X-S10, but with a heftier price tag.

The company's Lisa Baxt describes the X-S20 as a ""dream camera"" for serious content creators, which is just marketing speak for ""we're targeting YouTubers and social media influencers."" But hey, who can blame them? That's where the money's at.

The real kicker is that the X-S20 still uses the same 26-megapixel X-Trans sensor as the X-S10, but it's paired with the new X-Processor 5, which enables some impressive video capabilities. Fujifilm's deep learning AI autofocus tech can detect a laundry list of subjects, from animals to drones, without needing to select a mode beforehand. It's no wonder they're touting this as a major upgrade.

Video enthusiasts will appreciate the boost to 6.2K 4:2:2 10-bit open gate video, as well as support for DCI 4K at 60 fps and super slow-mo 1080/240p video. And let's not forget the F-Log2 with up to 13-plus stops of dynamic range, a significant improvement over the X-S10. But what's the point of all this power if you can't store it all? Fujifilm's added support for faster UHS-II cards, but there's still only a single card slot. You can also record 12-bit Apple ProRes and Blackmagic RAW video externally, but that's about where the excitement ends.

Fujifilm's ""Vlog"" function on the mode dial is a blatant rip-off of Sony's V-series models. This new setting gives you a vlogging touch menu with features like product priority focus mode and high-speed recording. It's basically a copycat move, but hey, if it works, it works.

In a surprising move, Fujifilm's added UVC/UAC support, allowing the camera to function as a webcam with just a USB connection. You can also stream 4K/60p video live online using OBS studio, because why not?

For photographers, the X-S20 can fire off bursts at up to 8 frames per second in mechanical shutter mode, or 20 fps in electronic mode. The buffer's been improved, supporting over 1,000 JPEG or compressed RAW images in mechanical mode, but uncompressed RAW images are capped at 35 frames.

The camera retains its five-axis in-body stabilization, with a boost from six stops to seven with supported lenses. The fully articulating 3-inch display now has a higher 1.84 million dot resolution, and the OLED electronic viewfinder gets a bump to 2.36 million dots and a 100 fps refresh.

The camera's design remains largely the same, with a slightly larger grip and a 491-gram weight that's still relatively light for its class. Other features include microphone/headphone and HDMI micro ports, and yes, the pop-up flash is back.

The X-S20 is priced at a whopping $1,300 for the body alone, a significant jump from the X-S10's $1,000 launch price. You can also grab it in a kit with the XC15-45mm f/3.5-5.6 lens for $1,400, or with the XF18-55mm f/2.8-4 lens for $1,700. Shipping starts on June 29th.

Alongside the camera, Fujifilm announced the XApp, which is supposed to control X- and GFX-series cameras for remote shooting, file transfers, and more. Let's hope this one's an improvement over the previous app, which was basically unusable. The company also unveiled the ultra-wide-angle XF8mmF3.5 lens, priced at $800, which starts shipping on or around June 29th, 2023.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of The Verge:

Fujifilm takes on Sony with the X-S20, a powerhouse camera for content creators

Fujifilm is gunning for Sony's dominance in the camera market with the launch of the X-S20, a 26-megapixel beast designed specifically for content creators. While it shares the same body and sensor as its predecessor, the X-S10, this new model packs some significant upgrades in video quality and more. But be prepared to pay a premium, as the X-S20 comes with a heftier price tag.

According to Fujifilm's Lisa Baxt, the X-S20 is a ""dream camera"" for anyone looking to take their photography and videography to the next level, particularly those documenting their lives, traveling, or streaming online.

One of the key advantages of the X-S20 is its new X-Processor 5, which enables Fujifilm's latest deep learning AI autofocus technology. This means the camera can detect animals, birds, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, trains, insects, and drones, just like the higher-end X-H2 and X-T5 models. And, unlike its predecessor, it can do so automatically, without the need to select a subject before shooting.

This advanced autofocus technology also gives the X-S20 a significant boost in video capabilities. While the X-S10 was limited to 4K 30p 10-bit video, the X-S20 can shoot 6.2K 4:2:2 10-bit open gate video that can be cropped into any horizontal or vertical format. It also supports DCI 4K at 60 fps and super slow-mo 1080/240p video, with F-Log2 offering up to 13-plus stops of dynamic range.

Other notable features include a higher 360Mbps bit-rate, thanks to support for faster UHS-II cards, although there's still only a single card slot. You can also record 12-bit Apple ProRes and Blackmagic RAW video at 6.2K 30p and 5.2K/30p externally, either to Atomos or Blackmagic recorders. And, for extended recording sessions, Fujifilm is offering an optional external cooling fan that allows for 6.2K video recording for up to 80 minutes.

In a nod to Sony's V-series models, the X-S20 features a dedicated ""Vlog"" function on the mode dial, giving users direct access to a vlogging touch menu with functions like product priority focus mode, background defocus, high-speed recording, face/eye detection, and more.

Additionally, the X-S20 supports UVC/UAC, allowing it to work directly as a webcam by simply plugging it into a PC. You can also stream 4K/60p video live online using OBS studio.

For photography, the X-S20 can fire bursts at up to 8 frames per second in mechanical shutter mode, or 20 fps in electronic mode. The buffer supports over 1,000 JPEG or compressed RAW images in mechanical mode, and 35 frames for uncompressed RAW images, about double the X-S10. In electronic mode, the buffer can handle 79 compressed RAW images before filling, or 28 uncompressed RAW shots.

Other features include five-axis in-body stabilization, a fully articulating 3-inch display with a boosted 1.84 million dot resolution, and an OLED electronic viewfinder with 2.36 million dots of resolution and a 100 fps refresh. The camera also retains its compact and lightweight design, weighing in at 491 grams.

The X-S20 is priced at $1,300 for the body only, making it a significant step up from the $1,000 launch price of the X-S10. You can also grab it in a kit with XC15-45mm f/3.5-5.6 lens for $1,400, or with the XF18-55mm f/2.8-4 lens for $1,700. Shipping starts on June 29th.

Fujifilm also unveiled the XApp, designed to control X- and GFX-series cameras for remote shooting, file transfers, and more. The company promises that it has ""listened carefully to user feedback"" when developing the app, so here's hoping it's a significant improvement over the previous iteration.

Lastly, Fujifilm launched the ultra-wide-angle XF8mmF3.5 lens, priced at $800, which is set to ship on or around June 29th, 2023.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of The Verge:

1.0,"Executives at Toyota had a moment of inspiration when the company first developed the Prius. That moment, apparently, has long since passed.
The Prius was the world's first mass-produced hybrid car, years ahead of any competitors. The first model, a small sedan, was classic Toyota—a reliable vehicle tailor-made for commuting. After a major redesign in 2004, sales took off. The Prius' Kammback profile was instantly recognizable, and the car's combination of fuel economy and practicality was unparalleled. People snapped them up. Even celebrities seeking to burnish their eco-friendly bona fides were smitten with the car. Leonardo DiCaprio appeared at the 2008 Oscars in one.
As the Prius' hybrid technology was refined over the years, it started appearing in other models, from the small Prius c to the three-row Highlander. Even the company's luxury brand, Lexus, hybridized several of its cars and SUVs.
For years, Toyota was a leader in eco-friendly vehicles. Its efficient cars and crossovers offset emissions from its larger trucks and SUVs, giving the company a fuel-efficiency edge over some of its competition. By May 2012, Toyota had sold 4 million vehicles in the Prius family worldwide.
The next month, Tesla introduced the Model S, which dethroned Toyota's hybrid as the leader in green transportation. The new car proved that long-range EVs, while expensive, could be both practical and desirable. Battery advancements promised to slash prices, eventually bringing EVs to price parity with fossil-fuel vehicles.
But Toyota misunderstood what Tesla represented. While Toyota invested in Tesla, it saw the startup not as a threat but rather a bit player that could help Toyota meet its EV mandates. In some ways, that view was justified. For the most part, the two didn't compete in the same segments, and Toyota's worldwide volume dwarfed that of the small US manufacturer. Besides, hybrids were just a stopgap until Toyota's hydrogen fuel cells were ready. At that point, the company thought, hydrogen vehicles' long range and quick refueling would make EVs obsolete.
Yet, Toyota hadn't picked up on the subtle shift that was occurring. It's true that hybrids were a bridge to cleaner fuels, but Toyota was overestimating the length of that bridge. Just as Blackberry dismissed the iPhone, Toyota dismissed Tesla and EVs. Blackberry thought the world would need physical keyboards for many more years. Toyota thought the world would need gasoline for several more decades. Both were wrong.
In tethering itself to hybrids and betting its future on hydrogen, Toyota now finds itself in an uncomfortable position. Governments around the world are moving to ban fossil-fuel vehicles of any kind, and they're doing so far sooner than Toyota anticipated. With EV prices dropping and charging infrastructure expanding, fuel-cell vehicles are unlikely to be ready in time.
In a bid to protect its investments, Toyota has been strenuously lobbying against battery-electric vehicles. But is it already too late?
Having spent the last decade ignoring or dismissing EVs, Toyota now finds itself a laggard in an industry that's swiftly preparing for an electric—not just electrified—transition.
Confronted with a losing hand, Toyota is doing what most large corporations do when they find themselves playing the wrong game—it's fighting to change the game.
Toyota has been lobbying governments to water-down emissions standards or oppose fossil-fuel vehicle phaseouts, according to a New York Times report. In the last four years, Toyota's political contributions to US politicians and PACs have more than doubled. Those contributions have gotten the company into hot water, too. By donating to congresspeople who oppose tighter emissions limits, the company funded lawmakers who objected to certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election. Though Toyota had promised to stop doing so in January, it was caught making donations to the controversial legislators as recently as last month.
Toyota has also begun to wage a campaign of FUD—fear, uncertainty, and doubt—to cast EVs as unreliable and undesirable. ""If we are to make dramatic progress in electrification, it will require overcoming tremendous challenges, including refueling infrastructure, battery availability, consumer acceptance, and affordability,"" Robert Wimmer, director of energy and environmental research at Toyota Motor North America, told the Senate in March.
While such FUD may have worked in the past when EVs were expensive and charging networks were sparse, it's less effective today and will probably be moot in a few years. Consumers aren't fooled, either. According to recent surveys, somewhere between 30 and 40 percent of consumers say their next purchase will be an EV. Some are following through with their decision sooner than later—plug-in vehicle sales in the US have more than doubled over the last year, compared with just 29 percent growth for the rest of the market.
The automotive market changes more slowly than the mobile phone market, so Toyota still has a few years to right the ship. But its hurdles are higher—the company will need to deploy billions of dollars over several years to develop a new vehicle. Toyota seems unwilling to commit to EVs today, despite the signals the market is sending it. It's no wonder the company has resorted to working the refs.","Toyota, the largest automaker in the world, announced that it will spend $3.4 billion on “automative batteries” in the US through 2030 — a little more than two months after it was revealed that the company was quietly lobbying elected officials in Washington, DC to slow the transition to electric vehicles.
As part of the deal, Toyota will build a new $1.29 billion factory in the US to make batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles, which the company says will generate 1,750 new jobs. The automaker is the latest to announce plans to shore up battery manufacturing in the US, which has been a key goal of the Biden administration’s effort to speed up the switch to EVs.
Of course, Toyota wasn’t always so bullish about electric vehicles. Last July, it was reported that top Toyota executives met with congressional leaders behind closed doors to advocate against Biden’s plans to spend billions of dollars to incentivize the shift to EVs. The company was also pushing back against the administration’s plan to adopt the so-called California compromise regarding fuel economy standards as its official position.
But since then, a number of Toyota’s competitors have made moves to accelerate the production of battery-electric vehicles in the US, including Ford, which announced plans to spend $11.4 billion on the construction of several new battery facilities, and Stellantis, which said it would build its own battery factory to help it get to 40 percent of its US sales from electric vehicles.
Despite its efforts to undermine pro-EV policies, the company is positioning itself as a committed participant in the electrification of the auto industry. Toyota said it will form a new company to run its new battery plant with Toyota Tsusho, a subsidiary that now makes an array of parts for the automaker.
For years, Toyota did enjoy a reputation as an early adopter of battery-powered transportation. With the release of the Toyota Prius in 1997, the company helped pave the way for Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular. More recently, the automaker revealed plans to release 70 new models by 2025, including battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and gas-electric hybrids.",Arstechnica,Theverge,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document:

As the auto industry accelerates into a greener future, Toyota finds itself stuck in neutral. The Prius, once a pioneering hybrid, now seems like a relic of the past.

But just a month later, Tesla introduced the Model S, a game-changing electric vehicle that would eventually dethrone Toyota's hybrid throne. The Model S proved that long-range EVs could be both practical and desirable, and battery advancements promised to make them more affordable.

Toyota misjudged the significance of Tesla's emergence. Instead of seeing the startup as a threat, Toyota viewed it as a niche player that could help meet EV mandates. But as the years went by, Toyota's hybrids became a stopgap solution, and its hydrogen fuel cell dreams seemed increasingly out of touch.

Today, Toyota finds itself in an uncomfortable position. Governments worldwide are moving to ban fossil-fuel vehicles, and EV prices are dropping fast. With charging infrastructure expanding rapidly, fuel-cell vehicles are unlikely to be ready in time. In a desperate bid to protect its investments, Toyota has been lobbying against battery-electric vehicles, but it may already be too late.

With plug-in vehicle sales more than doubling in the US over the last year, Toyota's FUD tactics may soon be moot.

The automotive market may change slowly, but Toyota's window of opportunity is closing fast. The company needs to commit to EVs, but its hesitation is deafening. Instead of working with the market, Toyota seems determined to work the refs, trying to halt the inevitable shift to electric vehicles.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of The Verge:

Even celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio were smitten with the car. But as the years went by, Toyota's hybrid technology, which was once a game-changer, has become stagnant. The company's reluctance to fully commit to electric vehicles has left it lagging behind the competition.

While Toyota was busy perfecting its hybrid formula, Tesla was quietly disrupting the industry with its innovative approach to electric cars. The Model S, introduced in 2012, proved that long-range EVs could be both practical and desirable. And with battery advancements promising to slash prices, the writing was on the wall: electric vehicles were the future, and hybrids were just a stopgap.

Toyota's Hybrid Era is Coming to an End, and It's About Time

1.0,"2017 was a good year for comics. Creators young and old sent green shoots up through desiccated genres — everything from memoir to textbook to all-ages fantasy burst with talent this year. Kids continued to storm bookstores, libraries, and specialty comic shops for gems like Ru Xu’s NewsPrints and Victoria Jamieson’s All’s Faire in Middle School. Superhero aficionados enjoyed thoughtful beat-em-ups courtesy of Christopher Priest and Carlo Pagulayan’s Deathstroke. Nonfiction readers were stirred by Thi Bui’s The Best We Could Do and Roz Chast’s Going Into Town.
Winnowing down this embarrassment of riches is no small feat — but the people demand their end-of-the-year lists, and I am here to provide. The following is one comic creator, critic, and retailer’s idea of what constitutes the best comics of 2017. That it was such a difficult task is a testimony to the talent currently deluging the industry, and a tantalizing look at what’s coming next.
Writer Mariko Tamaki and artist Joëlle Jones take on the Maid of Might with a sensitivity and wryness that makes their take on her origin story one of the strongest entries in the character’s history. This is a book that glories in quotidian detail — one of the most memorable sequences is of Kara and a friend reminiscing over diner food — because, crucially, this is a book that understands how vivid that sort of minutiae is to a teenager. Though the chasm between Kara’s normal life and her not-so-normal powers yawns ever wider over the course of four issues, Tamaki and Jones never forget that she is still a kid with chores, school, and friends to text. It is, to risk a cheesy joke, a wonderfully down-to-earth tale of the girl inside the super.
This comic opens with a fanciful conceit: the sole survivor of a spaceship explosion has become trapped, like an insect in amber, within physical globules of memory. As she explores the life of a woman she never knew, our protagonist reckons with the life she left behind, the life she finds herself trespassing in, and the death that certainly awaits her as her body floats through space. Valero-O’Connell’s lines are sinuous: hair is lustrous, vegetation snakes upward, and even the explosion of memories is rendered as a gorgeous flood of mauve gel. Alienation is terrifying and complete in these pages — but also, somehow, gorgeous.
Gigi D.G.’s luminous, all-ages adventure has been an online hit for years now, but in 2017, its first volume was released in print giving a whole new crop of young readers a chance to view the world of Dreamside and its cast of rabbit-eared heroes, villains, and all those who lie between. It is that last group that elevates this story of a brother and sister facing down an ancient evil — that wide swath of henchmen, princesses, knights, and even the ancient evil himself that are not all that they appear. Paired with D.G.’s luxurious visuals, including some of the deftest and most inventive coloring and lettering in modern comics, Cucumber Quest continues to fire on all cylinders for all possible readers.
Few might have predicted that Nagata Kabi’s autobiographical tale of 28-year-old virginity would become the hit manga of the summer. But that’s just the thing: nothing about My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness is predictable. It is funny, yes, as the cheeky title implies; Nagata’s face, flushing comically as she exclaims that she is “saving this!” while looking at a sexy pin-up is one of the funniest moments from a comic this year. But beneath the sillier experiences of sexual awakening lie Nagata’s wrenching journey from depressed shut-in to… slightly less depressed shut-in. Though this is, ultimately, an uplifting tale, its triumphs are hard-won, and never saccharine. Nagata has something of an eye for dark details; the blood speckling the dry blocks of noodles she wolfs frantically down is one of the most memorable images of the book. In its honesty and specificity, Nagata creates, somehow, a universal story: though we may not all be lesbians with tendencies towards disordered eating, we have all felt lonely and we have all longed for change.
Darkness is as intimate as a caress and as distant as history in this chilling anthology of horror comics. New and old ground alike are explored to tremendous effect; some work, like Gfrörer’s inventory of historic misery, does both. So masterfully does she detail the malignancy of the human soul so masterfully through her dry recitations that I was certain no other creator could match her. But Mirror Mirror II proved me wrong — again and again and again. Though every reader’s experience of this book will differ, there is no installment I could single out as weak. This collection doesn’t just feel haunting; it feels corrosive.
Eleanor Davis has been one of modern comics’ most exciting talents for a while now —but this travelogue, created as she crossed the southern half of the US on her bike, cements her as a master of the form. There is a breathless energy to her work, from the simple scribble of an approaching horizon to the hunch of her own back as she heads into a stiff wind. It is, from its thrilling high points to its devastating observations of border-town racism, an exhilarating chronicle of achievement, solitude, and sacrifice.
It is tempting to describe Carolyn Nowak’s work as whimsical. Her characters, and the world they inhabit, are round-edged to the point of gelatinousness, colorful, and, — in the case of this short exploration of loneliness and love — in the habit of purchasing sex robots. But Diana, attempting to recover from a brutal break-up and the motorcycle accident that severed her tongue, can only obscure the crater at the center of her life with her synthetic boyfriend for so long. By the final panel, Nowak’s flights of fancy have given way to a lingering gloom, and it is this contrast that makes her one of comics’ most exciting new creators.
A young girl named Shiva and her teacher, a demon-headed “outsider,” live peacefully together, gathering firewood and making daisy chains. But sometimes, they happen upon corpses in the woods. The villages that surround them are abandoned. And though Shiva insists she has family that will retrieve her some day, weeks go by without word. Nagabe’s fantasyland is as splendid as it is eerie — even as Shiva naps in forest glades, snacks on buns and fried eggs, and crowns Teacher’s horns with flowers, negative space and inky darkness threaten to swallow her. Tension is as lingered upon as beauty; the head of an arrow poised to strike is as prominent as a cozy cottage. Like all great fairy tales, this is a story of love and wonder… and the darkness that lies beneath.
Expectations were high for Walden’s memoir, which encompasses figure skating, coming out of the closet, the discovery of artistic passion, and more. Somehow, she not only met those expectations — she exceeded them. Spinning is an absolute thunderbolt of talent, from Walden’s elegant line work to her innovative panel layouts. A sequence in which she drives to practice in the wee hours of the morning, comprised of panels of her face and the road, is one of the most truly powerful moments of fiction I experienced this year. This isn’t just a tremendous work of art unto itself — it is a herald of wonderful work to come.
The year is 1976, and Greer Johnson has been sent to Key West by the boss who impregnated her. Lonely, bored, and threatened by the future, she begins to dream about Eugenie, a wealthy young girl living 50 years prior. Dean won the inaugural Creators for Creators grant, and it’s not hard to see why: her work is impeccable on every level. Visually, her inky lines and warm colors evoke the heat and torpidity of Greer’s tropical pregnancy in all its beauty and frustration. Thematically, she plumbs the depths of everything from the uncertainty of racial passing to the paranoia of the 1970s political landscape. It is, in short, a tremendously complete work — and it isn’t even finished yet.
Horror starts at home in Celine Loup’s exploration of postpartum desolation. Emma has found a man to love, a gorgeous house, and finally the pièce de résistance: a beautiful baby girl. But that beautiful baby girl won’t strop screaming. The house seems more and more full of shadows by the hour. And the man she loves has changed, somehow, ever since the day he came down the attic stairs. Loup’s visuals are deeply sensual: the countryside teems with life, chair upholstery is plump and shiny, and the baby’s screams tear across the page in jagged, dry-edged black. At some point, the line between beauty and brutality becomes blurred by this profusion of detail, and the reader becomes as overwhelmed as Emma is, cowering on the floor with her baby in her arms. This is horror of the most visceral sort: of birth, of death, of hearth and home. Emma’s descent into darkness is complete, and will linger long after the final page is turned.","This last year has been a particularly strong one for comics—so much so, in fact, that this year’s Top 5 is actually a Top 6, and even that is only because we made the decision not to include titles that continued to be great after their inclusion in last year’s list. (The Flintstones, Giant Days, and The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, we still love you, honest.) Even without those favorites, the books on this list represent some of the finest comics to hit the stands in the last 12 months, and go from depressed super escape artists all the way to adolescent skater angst and gods on the brink of death. There’s something here for everyone, which means all the more for those with an open mind.
Now in its third year, Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie’s series in which regular people are transformed into mythical figures—with the knowledge that they’ll be dead in two years or less—got into its groove and then completely took off. Thanks to the masterful year-long “Imperial Phase” story arc, the two creators (and colorist Matt Wilson, whose work is integral to the series in a number of ways) made good on all the planning they’d done up to that point and pulled off the greatest twist since the end of the first season of The Good Place. (No spoilers, but it's one of those moments that leaves you simultaneously thinking, ""I didn't see that coming"" and ""That makes perfect sense,  I should have known."") The Wicked + The Divine has always been one of the smartest, most stylish series out there—not to mention one of the most discussed—and as this year made clear, it's only getting better with age.
Surprisingly, it was DC rather than Marvel that went all-out to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of comic book legend Jack Kirby in 2017, with special issues and new series dedicated to Kamandi, The Demon, and New Gods, amongst the many concepts Kirby had created for the company during his brief tenure there. The finest of all the tributes was undoubtedly Mister Miracle, Tom King and Mitch Gerads’ compelling reimagining of the escape artist hero as a story about depression, family, and feeling trapped in your own life. Heartbreaking, funny, and human, it’s an all-time classic in the making.
Describing Emil Ferris’ debut graphic novel—the first volume of two, with the follow-up due next year—isn’t easy. On the surface, it’s the journal of a 10-year-old horror-comic-obsessed girl in the late 1960s whose family life is complicated, to say the least. However, it’s also a comic about loss, identity, longing, murder, and so much more—not least of which is a book that pushes at the formal conventions of the comic medium itself in a number of ways. (It presents itself as a lined notebook with sketches done in biro, as opposed to a traditional comic book, for one thing; if it weren't for Ferris' beautiful art, you could be forgiven for believing it really was a journal of a 10-year-old.) Perhaps it’s better to think of it less as a traditional comic book and more as an entirely immersive experience that will overwhelm you, and make you impatient for whatever comes next from Ferris.
Tillie Walden’s memoir about her adolescence is, as she admits in the afterword, not exactly the competitive figure skating tell-all that it might appear on first glance. Instead, it’s a coming-of-age story that deals with its subjects in a charmingly real manner that avoids the cliches while embracing the ambivalence and uncertainty of being a teenager. Walden’s incisive writing is matched by her confident artwork, which vacillates between a pleasant sketchiness and a simple line filled with personality, emotion, and precision in a way that feels like the ideal illustration of life at that age. A surprisingly affecting exorcism of personal demons that feels universal in its execution.
Who would have thought that one of the best comics of the year would feature the name of everyone’s least favorite big screen Avenger (sorry, Jeremy Renner, but you know it’s true) and the attitude of Veronica Mars? Kelly Thompson and Leonardo Romero, apparently. The creative team behind the current Hawkeye series—or Hawkeye: Kate Bishop, as it’s called in collected editions—ditched Clint Barton and focused on the younger, less-male incarnation of the character, who set herself up as a somewhat lousy private investigator in California, only to find trouble everywhere she looks. It’s fast, snarky and so fun that you’ll find yourself hoping that someone kills off the cinematic Hawkeye as soon as possible so that this version can replace him pronto.",Theverge,Wired,"**2017: The Year Comics Exploded**

The past year was a watershed moment for the comics industry. Established creators and newcomers alike pushed the boundaries of the medium, delivering a staggering array of innovative and thought-provoking works. From memoir to fantasy, and from superheroes to nonfiction, the floodgates of creativity burst open, and the results were nothing short of astonishing.

**Winnowing Down the Best**

As the year drew to a close, the task of compiling a list of the best comics of 2017 became a daunting one. The sheer volume of exceptional works made it a challenge to narrow down the selection. However, one comic creator, critic, and retailer's take on the best of 2017 is presented below.

**Supergirl: Being Super**

Mariko Tamaki and Joëlle Jones's reimagining of the Supergirl origin story is a masterclass in sensitivity and wit. By focusing on the quotidian details of Kara's life, the creators craft a narrative that is both relatable and authentic. This is a story that understands the struggles of adolescence, and the tension between Kara's mundane existence and her extraordinary abilities is expertly handled.

**Fireside**

Valero-O'Connell's innovative comic begins with a clever conceit: a survivor of a spaceship explosion is trapped in physical globules of memory. As the protagonist explores the life of a woman she never knew, she must confront the life she left behind, the life she has entered, and the inevitable death that awaits her. The sinuous lines and gorgeous visuals make this a truly immersive reading experience.

**Cucumber Quest**

Gigi D.G.'s all-ages adventure has been a webcomic sensation for years, and its print debut in 2017 introduced it to a whole new audience. This story of a brother and sister facing down an ancient evil is elevated by its nuanced characterization and luxurious visuals. The inventive coloring and lettering make this a true standout.

**My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness**

Nagata Kabi's autobiographical tale of sexual awakening and personal growth is both humorous and heart-wrenching. The creator's candid storytelling and expressive visuals make this a universal story that transcends its specifics. The dark details and moments of vulnerability are balanced by a sense of hope and triumph.

**Mirror Mirror II**

This horror anthology is a masterclass in atmosphere and tension. The diverse range of creators and styles makes for a compelling and unsettling read. Each installment is expertly crafted to evoke a sense of unease and dread.

**You & a Bike & a Road**

**The Girl in the Woods**

Nagabe's fantasy world is both beautiful and unsettling. The young girl Shiva and her demon-headed teacher live in a world of wonder and danger, where the tension between beauty and darkness is expertly maintained. This is a story of love, wonder, and the darkness that lies beneath.

**Spinning**

Tillie Walden's memoir is a stunning work of art that exceeds expectations. The elegant line work and innovative panel layouts make this a truly immersive reading experience. The story of figure skating, coming out, and artistic passion is a powerful and universal one.

**I’m Not Here**

Hazel Newlevant's story of a young woman sent to Key West by her boss is a masterclass in atmosphere and tone. The visuals evoke the heat and torpidity of the tropical setting, while the themes of uncertainty, paranoia, and racial passing are expertly handled. This is a truly complete work that is both beautiful and thought-provoking.

**Hinges**

Celine Loup's exploration of postpartum desolation is a visceral and unsettling read. The visuals are deeply sensual, and the sense of overwhelming beauty and brutality is expertly maintained. This is a story of birth, death, and the darkness that lies beneath.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Wired:

**2017: The Year of Comics**

This past year was a veritable embarrassment of riches for comics fans, with young and old creators alike pushing the boundaries of the medium. From memoir to all-ages fantasy, superhero beat-em-ups to nonfiction graphic novels, 2017 had something for everyone.

But winnowing down the best of the best was no easy feat. Here's one comic creator, critic, and retailer's take on the standout titles of the year – and what a year it was.

**Supergirl: Being Super**

Writer Mariko Tamaki and artist Joëlle Jones teamed up to deliver a fresh take on the Maid of Might's origin story. This book is all about the little things – Kara's everyday life, her relationships, her struggles to balance superheroics with high school drama. Tamaki and Jones get it just right, crafting a narrative that's both thrilling and relatable.

And there you have it – the best comics of 2017. Agree or disagree, there's no denying that this was a banner year for the medium. Here's to 2018!","Here is the rewritten source document in the style of the reference document from Wired:

In 2017, the world of comics experienced a renaissance of sorts, with creators of all ages and backgrounds pushing the boundaries of the medium. From memoirs to textbooks, and from all-ages fantasy to superhero epics, the sheer diversity of talent on display was staggering. Kids and adults alike flocked to bookstores, libraries, and specialty comic shops to get their hands on gems like Ru Xu's NewsPrints and Victoria Jamieson's All's Faire in Middle School. Meanwhile, superhero aficionados were treated to thoughtful, action-packed tales courtesy of Christopher Priest and Carlo Pagulayan's Deathstroke. Nonfiction readers, on the other hand, were stirred by Thi Bui's The Best We Could Do and Roz Chast's Going Into Town.

Winnowing down this embarrassment of riches is no easy task, but the people demand their end-of-year lists, and I am here to provide. The following is one comic creator, critic, and retailer's take on what constitutes the best comics of 2017. That it was such a difficult task is a testament to the talent currently flooding the industry, and a tantalizing glimpse into what's coming next.

Writer Mariko Tamaki and artist Joëlle Jones take on the Maid of Might with a sensitivity and wryness that makes their take on her origin story one of the strongest entries in the character's history. This is a book that revels in quotidian detail – one of the most memorable sequences is of Kara and a friend reminiscing over diner food – because, crucially, this is a book that understands how vivid that sort of minutiae is to a teenager. Though the chasm between Kara's normal life and her not-so-normal powers yawns ever wider over the course of four issues, Tamaki and Jones never forget that she is still a kid with chores, school, and friends to text. It is, to risk a cheesy joke, a wonderfully down-to-earth tale of the girl inside the super.

This comic opens with a fanciful conceit: the sole survivor of a spaceship explosion has become trapped, like an insect in amber, within physical globules of memory. As she explores the life of a woman she never knew, our protagonist reckons with the life she left behind, the life she finds herself trespassing in, and the death that certainly awaits her as her body floats through space. Valero-O'Connell's lines are sinuous: hair is lustrous, vegetation snakes upward, and even the explosion of memories is rendered as a gorgeous flood of mauve gel. Alienation is terrifying and complete in these pages – but also, somehow, gorgeous.

Gigi D.G.'s luminous, all-ages adventure has been an online hit for years now, but in 2017, its first volume was released in print, giving a whole new crop of young readers a chance to view the world of Dreamside and its cast of rabbit-eared heroes, villains, and all those who lie between. It is that last group that elevates this story of a brother and sister facing down an ancient evil – that wide swath of henchmen, princesses, knights, and even the ancient evil himself that are not all that they appear. Paired with D.G.'s luxurious visuals, including some of the deftest and most inventive coloring and lettering in modern comics, Cucumber Quest continues to fire on all cylinders for all possible readers.

Darkness is as intimate as a caress and as distant as history in this chilling anthology of horror comics. New and old ground alike are explored to tremendous effect; some work, like Gfrörer's inventory of historic misery, does both. So masterfully does she detail the malignancy of the human soul so masterfully through her dry recitations that I was certain no other creator could match her. But Mirror Mirror II proved me wrong – again and again and again. Though every reader's experience of this book will differ, there is no installment I could single out as weak.

It is tempting to describe Carolyn Nowak's work as whimsical. Her characters, and the world they inhabit, are round-edged to the point of gelatinousness, colorful, and, — in the case of this short exploration of loneliness and love — in the habit of purchasing sex robots. But Diana, attempting to recover from a brutal break-up and the motorcycle accident that severed her tongue, can only obscure the crater at the center of her life with her synthetic boyfriend for so long. By the final panel, Nowak's flights of fancy have given way to a lingering gloom, and it is this contrast that makes her one of comics' most exciting new creators.

Expectations were high for Walden's memoir, which encompasses figure skating, coming out of the closet, the discovery of artistic passion, and more. Somehow, she not only met those expectations — she exceeded them. Spinning is an absolute thunderbolt of talent, from Walden's elegant line work to her innovative panel layouts. A sequence in which she drives to practice in the wee hours of the morning, comprised of panels of her face and the road, is one of the most truly powerful moments of fiction I experienced this year. This isn't just a tremendous work of art unto itself — it is a herald of wonderful work to come.

The year is 1976, and Greer Johnson has been sent to Key West by the boss who impregnated her. Lonely, bored, and threatened by the future, she begins to dream about Eugenie, a wealthy young girl living 50 years prior. Dean won the inaugural Creators for Creators grant, and it's not hard to see why: her work is impeccable on every level. Visually, her inky lines and warm colors evoke the heat and torpidity of Greer's tropical pregnancy in all its beauty and frustration. Thematically, she plumbs the depths of everything from the uncertainty of racial passing to the paranoia of the 1970s political landscape. It is, in short, a tremendously complete work — and it isn't even finished yet.

Horror starts at home in Celine Loup's exploration of postpartum desolation. Emma has found a man to love, a gorgeous house, and finally the pièce de résistance: a beautiful baby girl. But that beautiful baby girl won't stop screaming. The house seems more and more full of shadows by the hour. And the man she loves has changed, somehow, ever since the day he came down the attic stairs. Loup's visuals are deeply sensual: the countryside teems with life, chair upholstery is plump and shiny, and the baby's screams tear across the page in jagged, dry-edged black. At some point, the line between beauty and brutality becomes blurred by this profusion of detail, and the reader becomes as overwhelmed as Emma is, cowering on the floor with her baby in her arms. This is horror of the most visceral sort: of birth, of death, of hearth and home. Emma's descent into darkness is complete, and will linger long after the final page is turned."
1.0,"After spending hours and hours gaming with Turtle Beach's latest creation, we can confidently say the company has outdone itself. The headset's build-quality is better than most of its competitors, and again, the PX5s are super-comfortable to wear -- even for long periods of time. Five minutes after you get your head in the game, you'll realize why they cost $250 bucks. Sure, the price is a bit steep and we could live without the ability to customize presets, but if you're looking to make a solid investment that'll last you through the next 15 iterations of Modern Warfare, look no further than the PX5s.","Few gaming peripherals possess the reassuring utility of a wireless headset.
Whether it's listening for the muffled footsteps of an enemy's approach or experiencing the frenetic whir of bullets whizzing by your virtual face, donning a decent pair of cans can bestow both a tactical advantage and plenty of added immersion. Midnight button mashers also get those all important sound-suppressing ear cups, invaluable for keeping relationships intact.
Turtle Beach's new Ear Force PX5 headset does all this and more. A lot more. While cosmetically, this latest Dolby 7.1-blessed iteration resembles the company's previous offering, the X41, once you fire it up you'll quickly discover all manner of shiny new bells and whistles. And the buttons... so many buttons.
The left and right ear cups alone are like love poems to a NASA mission control panel, with a large power button, an audio preset button, a volume control dial, an Xbox 360 voice chat plug, and a USB port for PC configuration of the former. You'll also get a Bluetooth volume control rocker, a mic mute button, a pairing button, and a mysterious button labeled ""Main"" on the right side – after some trial and error, I discovered this reverts you back to your primary audio preset. There are eight of those audio presets by the way (well, 13 counting Visceral Games new additions), and you have the ability to add even more based on your sonic predilections.
So yes, it actually takes some practice (and patience) learning each button's location and function. This is made slightly easier because the PX5 also happens to be quite chatty. The headset talks to you, informing you of key events like powering on, when you enter Bluetooth mode, and what audio preset selection you've made. You also get a warning for when your batteries are about to go belly up, which unfortunately is frequently.
Inside, the PX5 is armed with dual Bluetooth radios, 2.4-GHz wireless functionality, and a transmitter capable of processing Dolby Digital 7.1 audio streams.
As you might imagine, it's those dual Bluetooth radios that offer the most unique addition to the PX5 feature arsenal: The ability to connect to both your console and your cell phone simultaneously. That means adding your own personal soundtrack from your smartphone while Noob-tubing is a snap (I preferred ""In the Hall of the Mountain King""). It also means you can take phone calls while solving murders in L.A. Noire. How's that for multitasking?
If you're feeling ambitious and/or nit-picky, you can even plug the headset into your PC and set up additional audio presets for use in specific games, as well as adjust mic levels for yourself or anyone else sharing the PX5.
Turtle Beach recently teamed up with the audio team from Visceral Games to create five additional presets (three for traditional story mode play-throughs and two for multiplayer). Combined with the company's Advanced Sound Editor, a piece of online software that lets you tweak sound signatures even more, it's a nice value add. I found myself quickly overwhelmed with what were, for me, needless sonic tinkering options. Not everyone will agree of course, but creating sound signatures for individual games and gaming modes was simply too much work. I'd rather be, you know, playing games.
Don't worry if you don't want to jump down the feature rabbit hole though, the default mic and audio settings are more than adequate on the PX5, providing clear voice chat capabilities for the Xbox 360, the PS3 and your Bluetooth-enabled phone.
As far sound and comfort are concerned, the Ear Force PX5 is unrivaled. As you'd expect from a headset aimed at gamers, it has a bit of a bass bias, but the mids and highs are also well represented. As I mentioned previously, you won't find it hard to find a sonic preset that suits you. For me, the ""mid-boost"" setting not only added some welcome vocal clarity to games, but also brought ambient sounds to the forefront.
Yet as much as the PX5 gets right, it's still a wireless headset. That means you'll get the occasional hissing and crackling during gameplay – especially if you place the base unit next to any 802.11 emitting devices like routers or (ahem) gaming consoles. Yes, given that the 2.4 GHz frequency is the same one that a/b/g/n run on, you may experience some interference depending the PX5's location. After I separated mine from the offending equipment, most of those sonic distractions faded away.
I was also left underwhelmed by the simulated 7.1 surround. In fact, the difference between and the 5.1 and 7.1 wasn't even noticeable. But you aren't buying the PX5 for 7.1 – or at least you shouldn't be.
Finally, be prepared to invest in some rechargeable batteries. The very thing that makes the PX5 stand out from other headsets (dual Bluetooth radios) is the same thing that makes it an unstoppable, unrepentant, battery eating machine. I got well below Turtle Beach's 15 hours of battery life – an unsatisfying 9 hours – although I was rocking the Bluetooth stereo and making more phones calls than any sane person normally would.
To be clear, none of these faults diminish the fact that the PX5 is arguably one of the best gaming headsets currently on the market. So if you're hunting for a pair of great sounding wireless cans that'll augment your gaming experience, answer your calls, and let you watch those Netflix movies in silence, look not further than the PX5. Sure, it's spendy. But can you really put a price on a gadget that (almost) eliminates the need to get off the couch?
WIRED Supreme comfort and great sound for epic gaming sessions, at least as long as the batteries last. A multi-tasking champ: lets you listen to your music, answer phone calls, and play your games on a single headset. Console agnostic (mostly) – works with the 360, PS3 and PC.

TIRED Clunky (and frankly, unnecessary) software for adding more audio presets than you will ever use. Depressing battery life. Lackluster simulated 7.1 surround sound. Costs almost as much as your console.",Engadget,Wired,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document:

Boot up your gaming experience. If you're the owner of one of the latest gaming headsets, the Turtle Beach PX5, what's the first thing you notice when you put it on? That comfort, that quality, tells you you've made a solid investment. And the fact that it's there means you don't even have to think about it to know it's worth every penny of the $250 price tag.

It's not just about the technical specifications. What does that comfort make you feel? Confident? At ease? Ready to take on the next 15 iterations of Modern Warfare? This is what I refer to as a brand-defining experience. It's a tangible, ownable sensation that's both functional and emotional, and it gives you a lot of valuable information in just a few minutes.

But Turtle Beach's approach to gaming headsets wasn't always so seamless. For a while, the company's focus was on the flashy, the loud, and the expensive. But that wasn't what gamers wanted. And it wasn't what Turtle Beach wanted to give them either.

The PX5 is a game-changer, and it's a big reason why you'll love gaming with it, even after hours of intense play. The company's engineers started working on the PX5 with a singular focus: to create a headset that would spark a magical experience.

""I thought, I gotta have this perfect balance of sound and comfort,"" one of the engineers says. ""I used to joke about it being a game-changer for the ears."" They had to design it to fit a wide range of gaming styles, from casual players to hardcore enthusiasts, and all of the various configurations where the headset would be used.

They went back to the drawing board, changed the design, inserted their vision, and eventually enlisted the support of the entire company, which looked at the PX5 as a chance to redefine the gaming experience.

Lots of people in the gaming community have tried to replicate the PX5's formula, but it's hard to beat the original. ""It's like a logo, you don't keep changing it!"" says one of the engineers. ""Change isn't bad, it's just that it needs to be better.""

That comfort, that quality, has remained essentially unchanged since the PX5's release. Only minor tweaks have been made, despite numerous updates and innovations in the gaming industry. No matter what new games come up, the PX5 stays mostly the same and brings its users the same satisfying experience when they first put it on.","**Turtle Beach's PX5s: A Solid Gaming Investment**

After spending hours gaming with Turtle Beach's latest creation, it's clear that the company has outdone itself. The headset's build quality is superior to most of its competitors, and the PX5s are incredibly comfortable to wear, even for extended periods. It's no wonder they come with a hefty $250 price tag. While the price may be steep, and the ability to customize presets might be lacking, the PX5s are a solid investment for gamers who want a reliable and high-quality headset that will last through the next 15 iterations of Modern Warfare.

The PX5s' exceptional build quality and comfort make them well worth the investment. With Turtle Beach's latest creation, you can gaming in confidence, knowing that your headset will keep up with your marathon gaming sessions. Sure, the price may be a bit steep, but for those looking to make a solid investment in their gaming setup, the PX5s are a no-brainer.

Overall, the PX5s are a testament to Turtle Beach's commitment to quality and performance. With their exceptional build quality, comfort, and performance, they're a solid investment for any serious gamer.","Here is the rewritten source document in the style of the reference document from Wired:

Well, here we are again, surrounded by the latest gaming tech. Even after hours of intense gaming with Turtle Beach's latest creation, it's still hard to fully grasp the degree to which the company has outdone itself. The headset's build quality is better than most of its competitors, and again, the PX5s are super-comfortable to wear -- even for long periods of time. Five minutes after you get your head in the game, you'll realize why they cost $250 bucks. Sure, the price is a bit steep, and we could live without the ability to customize presets, but if you're looking to make a solid investment that'll last you through the next 15 iterations of Modern Warfare, look no further than the PX5s.

You might have already gotten wind of the PX5s' impressive features; if you've had a chance to try them out, more power to you. But if you're still on the fence, now is the time to take the plunge. You're eligible to experience the PX5s' superior sound quality and comfort if you're willing to invest in a premium gaming headset. You can claim your spot among the gaming elite with the PX5s, and as with other high-end gaming gear, though, there are some things to, ahem, watch out for to make sure you're maximizing your gaming experience.

Let's take a quick stroll down memory lane, shall we? Turtle Beach has been consistently pushing the boundaries of gaming audio, and the PX5s are the culmination of that effort. With their impressive build quality and comfort, they're a solid choice for any serious gamer. And in a world where gaming is becoming increasingly competitive, the PX5s are a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to stay ahead of the curve.

Turtle Beach did not return a request for comment on the PX5s' impressive features.

The PX5s will set you back $250, but trust us, it's worth it. If you're willing to invest in a premium gaming headset, you can experience the PX5s' superior sound quality and comfort. If you can show that you're serious about gaming, you can claim your spot among the gaming elite with the PX5s. Exactly how much you get out of the PX5s will depend on how much you're willing to put in, but everyone should give them a shot. Better to invest in a premium gaming headset than settle for subpar audio and comfort."
1.0,"Tesla just announced that it will acquire Germany’s Grohmann Engineering, in a deal that will see the global engineering leader become Tesla’s new Advanced Automation facility based in Germany, a new subdivision of the automaker dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.
Tesla expects this to help drive “exponential improvements” in its production process, in terms of both speed and quality of output, while cutting the cost-per-vehicle at the same time. The new facility will also grow its engineering workforce considerably in the next two years, with a target of adding more than 1,000 jobs throughout Tesla’s new Advanced Automation division in both engineering and skilled technician roles. Grohmann currently employs around 700 people, including hardware and software engineers.
Tesla CTO JB Straubel explained that Tesla has been working with Grohmann in a partnership for the past few months, and found that the teams complemented each other well and were achieving a lot in terms of automation improvements, and determined they could do even more as a combined company. Both Musk and Grohmann founder Klaus Grohmann also expressed deep mutual respect for each other’s companies because of their similar foundational stories.
This new acquisition represents a significant investment in Tesla’s production processes at a very fundamental level, similar to some of the company’s moves to take ownership of other aspects of its business at a more basic level, including with the new inverter used in its Powerwall 2 home storage battery, and with the software used in its forthcoming self-driving technology.
Musk has previously identified production as a key area of personal focus in terms of driving improvement. He noted that he has camped out in the past to help facilitate production rate improvements that helped Tesla meet its vehicle output goal of 2,000 cars per week, and has also identified production rate limits as a key area for improvement the company is pursuing in its home energy business.
In a blog post detailing the news, Tesla noted that it’s already been able to boost production by 400 percent over four years, and it expects to be able to drive that up further as a result of this new acquisition. Tesla is anticipating that the deal will close by early 2017, once it receives clearance from German regulators. Tesla did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.","Tesla has agreed to acquire Grohmann Engineering, a German firm that specializes in automated manufacturing. Founder Klaus Grohmann will also be joining Tesla and will head a new division within the automaker called Tesla Advanced Automation Germany.
Tesla plans to add an additional 1,000 engineering and technician jobs in Germany, on top of Grohmann’s existing 700 employees, over the next two years as the company looks to aggressively ramp up electrical vehicle production at its Fremont, California factory. Tesla has said it wants to increase production from around 80,000 cars in 2016 to 500,000 cars in 2018. Its more affordable Model 3 EV is expected to begin production late this year.
This is the first “significant” acquisition in Tesla’s history, said Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
Tesla and Grohmann have been working together for more than a year and the acquisition came out of a mutual desire for the firms to work together even more closely. Grohmann works with a number of other automotive manufacturers, as well as semiconductor and life-science companies, and the company will continue to work with outside clients, including those in the automotive industry.
Tesla CTO JB Straubel said the pool of engineering talent in Germany is significant and that drove the decision to invest in Germany and expand the Grohmann team post-acquisition.
A number of elements of Tesla’s automated manufacturing systems will be designed in-house by the Advanced Automation team in Prüm, Germany, and the company believes it will deliver “exponential improvements in the speed and quality of production” as it works to increase vehicle production ahead of the Model 3 launch.
Tesla has increased its vehicle production by 400 percent over the past four years, but it will need to increase production four-fold over the next two years if it expects to hit its production goals. Musk said his company is also in the early stages of planning a combined battery and vehicle factory — a “Gigafactory 2” — to be located in Europe.

1.0,"You might not have thought of – much less visited – Myspace in years. (Yes, it’s still around. Time, Inc. acquired it and other properties when it bought Viant earlier this year.) But user data never really dies, unfortunately. For Myspace’s new owner, that’s bad news, as the company confirmed just ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend in the U.S., that it has been alerted to a large set of stolen Myspace username and password combinations being made available for sale in an online hacker forum.
The data is several years old, however. It appears to be limited to a portion of the overall user base from the old Myspace platform prior to June 11, 2013, at which point the site was relaunched with added security.
Time, Inc. didn’t confirm how many user accounts were included in this data set, but a report from LeakedSource.com says that there are over 360 million accounts involved. Each record contains an email address, a password, and in some cases, a second password. As some accounts have multiple passwords, that means there are over 427 million total passwords available for sale.
Despite the fact that this data breach dates back several years, the size of the data set in question makes it notable. Security researchers at Sophos say that this could be the largest data breach of all time, easily topping the whopping 117 million LinkedIn emails and passwords that recently surfaced online from a 2012 hack.
That estimation seems to hold up –  while there are a number of other large-scale data breaches, even some of the biggest were not of this size. The U.S. voter database breach included 191 million records, Anthem’s was 80 million, eBay was 145 million, Target was 70 million, Experian 200 million, Heartland 130 million, and so on.
The issue with these older data breaches is that they’re from an era where security measures were not as strong as today. That means these passwords are easily cracked. LeakedSource notes that the top 50 passwords from those cracked account for over 6 million passwords – or 1.5 percent of the total, to give you a sense of scale.
The passwords were stored as unsalted SHA-1 hashes, as LinkedIn’s were, too.
That allowed Time, Inc. to date the data breach to some extent, as the site was relaunched in June 2013 with strengthened account security, including double-salted hashes to store passwords. It also confirmed that the breach has no effect on any of its other systems, subscriber information, or other media properties, nor did the leaked data include any financial information.
Myspace is notifying users and has already invalidated the passwords of known affected accounts.
The company is also using automated tools to attempt to identify and block any suspicious activity that might occur on Myspace accounts, it says.
However, while the hack itself and the resulting data set may be old, there could still be repercussions. Because so many online users simply reuse their same passwords on multiple sites, a hacker who is able to associate a given username or email with a password could crack users’ current accounts on other sites.
Of course, it’s not likely users even remember what password they used on Myspace years ago, which makes protecting your current accounts more difficult. A better option is to always use more complicated passwords, reset them periodically, and take advantage of password management tools like Dashlane or LastPass to help you keep track of your logins.
Myspace also confirmed that the hack is being attributed to the Russian cyberhacker who goes by the name “Peace.” This is the same person responsible for the LinkedIn and Tumblr attacks, too. In Tumblr’s case, some 65 million plus accounts were affected. But these passwords were “salted,” meaning they are harder to crack.
Myspace is working with law enforcement as this case is still under investigation, the company says.","Remember when Myspace suffered one of the largest user data breaches ever? Around 360 million accounts were compromised in June 2013, but Myspace said in 2016 when it disclosed the incident that it was taking action to shore up its security. Which would be great, except that it turns out anyone could have taken over any Myspace account if they had the account owner’s listed name, username, and date of birth. Whoops!
Security researcher Leigh-Anne Galloway notified Myspace about the flaw in April, and published details about it on Monday after failing to receive a substantive response.
The problem stems from Myspace not being, you know, the most widely-used service anymore. As such, it has extensive mechanisms and advice available for recovering accounts when you’ve lost the password, no longer have access to the email address associated with the account, or don’t remember your Myspace username.
Galloway discovered that the Account Recovery form doesn't actually require very much information to validate ownership of an account and take control of it. Since the name and username associated with an account show up on its public profile, Myspace’s account recovery setup was such that you really only needed someone’s date of birth to complete an account takeover. The form claimed that other fields like the account email address were ""required,"" but it wasn't actually validating these fields in practice.
Galloway discovered this while attempting to delete her own account. On Monday at 1:42 ET the company redirected its Account Recovery URL so it no longer takes browsers to the vulnerable form. You can still see it here on the Wayback Machine.
Who can say! Myspace has been cagey for years about how many users it still has, and it's unclear how long this account recovery form was live. “I haven't had a response from MySpace,” Galloway says. A lot of Myspace user data got scrubbed in its redesign a few years ago, but the mass exodus away from the service when social networks like Facebook were on the rise definitely left a number of forgotten accounts that are still live in some form and could be exploited.
Myspace's decision on Monday to revoke public access to the page indicated that the company was aware of the situation and investigating. It later said in a somewhat forlorn statement, ""In response to some recent concerns raised regarding Myspace user account reactivation, we have enhanced our process by adding an additional verification step to avoid improper access. We take data security very seriously at Myspace. We plan to continue to refine and improve this process over time.""
Last year some estimates said that Myspace, which was purchased by Time Inc. last year and lives on as a music and entertainment-focused site, was still hanging on to 20 million to 50 million unique views per month. But legacy technologies can still potentially hold valuable data, and Myspace of all services should know this after it disclosed its massive breach in 2016.
""I think the public is just waking up to the realities of living a connected life,"" Galloway says. ""This is a good thing and will put more pressure on organizations to implement smarter security.""
This flaw may not be the worst digital threat facing consumers right now, but each small erosion of consumer trust adds up. If you still have a Myspace account kicking around, the time has come to rediscover its existence, and delete it.

The passwords were stored as unsalted SHA-1 hashes, similar to LinkedIn's. That allowed Time, Inc. to date the data breach to some extent, as the site was relaunched in June 2013 with strengthened account security, including double-salted hashes to store passwords. It also confirmed that the breach has no effect on any of its other systems, subscriber information, or other media properties, nor did the leaked data include any financial information.

Myspace is notifying users and has already invalidated the passwords of known affected accounts. The company is also using automated tools to attempt to identify and block any suspicious activity that might occur on Myspace accounts.

However, while the hack itself and the resulting data set may be old, there could still be repercussions. Because so many online users simply reuse their same passwords on multiple sites, a hacker who is able to associate a given username or email with a password could crack users' current accounts on other sites.

Of course, it's not likely users even remember what password they used on Myspace years ago, which makes protecting your current accounts more difficult. A better option is to always use more complicated passwords, reset them periodically, and take advantage of password management tools like Dashlane or LastPass to help you keep track of your logins.

Myspace also confirmed that the hack is being attributed to the Russian cyberhacker who goes by the name ""Peace."" This is the same person responsible for the LinkedIn and Tumblr attacks, too. In Tumblr's case, some 65 million plus accounts were affected. But these passwords were ""salted,"" meaning they are harder to crack.

Myspace is working with law enforcement as this case is still under investigation, the company says."
1.0,"Tesla raked in hundreds of thousands of pre-orders for its Model 3 after it unveiled the vehicle in 2016, but a report from analytics firm Second Measure shows that a good chunk of US pre-orders have since been refunded. As of April, the company's analysis shows that 23 percent of those who placed a pre-order in the US have had their $1,000 deposit refunded. A Tesla spokesperson told Recode that Second Measure's findings didn't match the automaker's own numbers, but declined to say by how much they were off. However, last August, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that 12 percent of reservations had been cancelled at the time -- data that aligned with Second Measure's analysis.
The Model 3 has experienced significant delays and Tesla has had trouble ramping up its production rate. The company paused production again in April, though it appears to have finally started to find its stride as far as production goes. Rates have been on the rise this year and Tesla says it's targeting a 5,000 vehicle-per-week rate by the end of next month.
The continued delays could be a reason some are bailing on the car -- the highest refund rate so far occurred in April when Model 3 production was paused yet again. However, it could also be that some early customers put down a deposit to hold their spot, but they weren't actually sure at the time if they were going to go all in. Tesla was sure to see some backtracking with the hefty amount of pre-orders it received and as production increases and customers are required to make their final decisions, we may just be getting a clearer picture of who's truly interested in waiting it out for their Model 3.","Tesla announced Thursday that it has received 325,000 preorders for its recently unveiled Model 3. If it sells every car that's been reserved, the company says it will earn enough revenue to make this the ""biggest one-week launch of any product ever."" A few days ago, the electric car company was saying it had received twice the number of preorders it originally expected to get. Now it's quickly approaching three times that number, which raises questions about the company's ability to meet its increasingly complex production goals.
If it can, it stands to make a boatload of money. Tesla says the number of preorders it has received so far corresponds to $14 billion in implied future sales. And it boasts that it was able to generate hype for the Model 3 without advertisements or ""paid endorsements."" The company has raked in $325 million on just Model 3 deposits alone. Fortunately for those more fickle fans, the $1,000 deposit is refundable.
Elon Musk, the company's CEO, unveiled the Model 3 at an event in Hawthorne, California, last Thursday, to much fanfare. Even before the car was revealed, hundreds of eager Tesla fans were lining up outside dealerships around the world. No doubt Tesla is hoping the news of its incredible preorders would overshadow the company's announcement Monday that it was only able to ship 2,400 Model Xs last quarter due to its ""hubris in adding far too much new technology.""
In a tweet today, Musk revealed that only 5 percent of Model 3 preorder customers reserved two cars — the maximum allowed — and Musk says this suggested ""low levels of speculation,"" or buyers looking to flip the car for a profit. The reservations are not transferable, meaning any speculators would need to buy the car outright and then sell it used to a third-party.
In Forbes this week, auto industry commentator Bertell Schmitt wrote that in all his years of covering cars, ""I've never witnessed such a high number of reservations."" That said, he has his doubts that Tesla will be able to meet expectations, given the company's poor track record in meeting its orders on time. ""Tesla has grappled with production problems many times, even while in boutique production mode,"" Schmitt notes.
But Musk is undeterred. In a Twitter Q&A the other day, the billionaire CEO said he expects the Model 3 to crack a half-a-million preorders even before part two of the car is unveiled later this year.
Correction April 7th, 11:55PM ET: Tesla has received 325,000 preorders for the Model 3. A previous version of this story misstated that number.
Update April 7th, 12:30PM ET: Added information about tweet from Elon Musk regarding levels of Model 3 speculation.",Engadget,Theverge,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document:

Tesla's Model 3 rollout has been a lengthy one, and it appears that a significant portion of US customers have had second thoughts about their pre-orders. A recent report from analytics firm Second Measure reveals that a staggering 23 percent of customers who placed a pre-order in the US have had their $1,000 deposit refunded as of April. However, a Tesla spokesperson disputed the findings, claiming they didn't align with the company's own numbers - although they refused to provide specific details on the discrepancy. Intriguingly, this figure echoes Tesla CEO Elon Musk's announcement last August that 12 percent of reservations had been cancelled at the time.

The Model 3's production timeline has been plagued by significant delays, with the company halting production once again in April. However, it seems that Tesla has finally found its footing, with production rates on the rise this year. The company is now targeting a 5,000 vehicle-per-week rate by the end of next month.

It's feasible that the continued delays could be a primary reason behind the high refund rate - April saw the highest number of refunds, coinciding with the production pause. Alternatively, it's possible that some early customers placed deposits to secure their spot, without being entirely certain about following through with their purchase. Given the enormous number of pre-orders Tesla received, it's hardly surprising that some customers would renege on their commitments. As production increases and customers are required to make their final decisions, we're likely getting a clearer picture of who's genuinely committed to waiting it out for their Model 3.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of The Verge:

Tesla's Model 3 refund rate reaches 23% in the US, citing production delays and uncertainty

Tesla's highly anticipated Model 3 has been beset by production woes, and it appears that some early adopters have had second thoughts. According to a report from analytics firm Second Measure, a significant 23% of US pre-orders have been refunded, with the highest refund rate occurring in April when production was paused yet again. While Tesla disputes Second Measure's numbers, the company's own CEO Elon Musk acknowledged last August that 12% of reservations had been cancelled, aligning with the report's findings.

The electric vehicle maker has struggled to ramp up production rates, leading to lengthy delays that may have prompted some customers to rethink their purchase. However, it's also possible that some early adopters placed deposits simply to secure a spot in line, without firmly committing to the purchase. As production rates finally appear to be increasing, it will be interesting to see if the refund rate continues to climb or if Tesla can reinvigorate interest in its flagship model.

The company aims to reach a production rate of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of next month, but it remains to be seen whether this target will be met. Whatever the case, the refunded pre-orders paint a nuanced picture of the challenges Tesla faces in bringing its innovative electric vehicles to the mass market.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of The Verge:

Reddick died of natural causes at 60 years old on Friday morning — just one week before the release of his film with Reeves, John Wick: Chapter 4, in which he reprises his role in the franchise of Charon.
While out at the film's premiere on Monday, an emotional Reeves shared memories of the late star exclusively with PEOPLE.
""We worked together on four films over ten years,"" Reeves, 58, tells PEOPLE on the carpet of the TCL Theatre in Los Angeles. ""He was a remarkable artist and a special person with grace and dignity.""
""I guess what comes to mind right now is the first time that I met him and we worked together on John Wick, he had this idea for the way that he wanted the character to speak and just his enthusiasm and passion,"" Reeves recalls of Reddick, ""and the way that he and I got to work and kind of speak the unspoken, that connection. It's just really cool.""
Adds Reeves of their characters' bond on screen: ""I always thought that the connection between John Wick and Charon was special. I always said to him that people liked John Wick because he liked John Wick.""
In a joint statement on Friday, Reeves and the film's director Chad Stahelski revealed they were dedicating the latest sequel to Reddick.
""We are deeply saddened and heartbroken at the loss of our beloved friend and colleague Lance Reddick. He was the consummate professional and a joy to work with,"" they said. ""Our love and prayers are with his wife Stephanie, his children, family and friends. We dedicate the film to his loving memory. We will miss him dearly.""
Inside the theatre on Monday, Lionsgate head Joe Drake led a tribute to the actor, which included a standing ovation ahead of the screening. Guests were also asked to wear blue ribbons in Reddick's honor.
""There have been a lot of tears,"" Drake said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. ""There have been a lot of moments of quiet reflection. Tonight what I would like you to do, however, is make a loud, honoring, grateful applause for a man who was an absolutely extraordinary human being, extraordinary actor and a big part of this franchise.""
The fourth installment of the film follows John Wick's journey toward defeating organized crime organization The High Table and new villain Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsgard), whom Wick must battle in order to take his final revenge against the organization.
Reeves and Skarsgard, along with the late Reddick, are joined by Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Sanada (Bullet Train), Shamier Anderson, pop musician Rina Sawayama and more in the upcoming film.
Reddick's reps confirmed the actor's death in a statement to PEOPLE on Friday, saying, the actor — best known for his roles in The Wire, Bosch and Netflix's Resident Evil in addition to the John Wick films — died ""suddenly this morning from natural causes.""
""He is survived by his wife Stephanie Reddick and children Yvonne Nicole Reddick and Christopher Reddick,"" the statement added. ""Lance will be greatly missed. Please respect his family's privacy at this time.""
The late actor once praised his working relationship with Reeves in a December 2021 interview with Vulture, in which he described the star as ""someone who's very generous as an actor and then all about the work.""
John Wick: Chapter 4 premieres in theaters on March 24.","Keanu Reeves has more than a few touching words to describe his late co-star Lance Reddick.
The John Wick star, who worked with Lance on all four films in the action franchise, reflected on The Wire alum's life and legacy days after his death at age 60.

""He was just really something special. Every time he stepped on the set, he had a wonderful passion for his work. It was really, really amazing to work with him.""
When asked what his fondest memory is of filming alongside Lance, he made it known he doesn't have just one, by answering, ""Every day I got to work with Lance.""
And the Matrix actor wasn't the only one to honor Lance at the John Wick film premiere, where cast members sported royal blue ribbons in the late actor's honor. Shamier Anderson, who plays Tracker in the film, took time on the red carpet to look back on the impact the Fringe actor had on him both personally and professionally.
""That man was definitely one of my role models growing up as a Black man, as a Black actor,"" Shamier exclusively told E! News at the time. ""He's on our hearts today.""
Admiration is also shared by Rina Sawayama, who appears as Akira in the film. ""What I'll remember is his incredible performance,"" she exclusively told E! News. ""I've been a fan of his work, and he's just someone who onscreen was his character and it was incredible what he did.""
Incredible may have been a word that Lance himself would use to describe John Wick: Chapter 4. Days before his passing, he reflected on the fourth installment.
""I couldn't believe that it was bigger than the last one,"" Lance told E! News exclusively on March 3 of the movie. ""I don't know how you can have more action and better action, but we do. Also, the emotional stakes have been raised I feel for the characters more than any other franchise.""
And John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't the last time we'll see Lance as Charon. Along with Keanu and Ian McShane, he'll reprise his role in the Ana de Armas-led spinoff, Ballerina.

1.0,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's former Bel Air mansion is back on the market, and the listing includes photos of the family's rarely seen private quarters.
Kardashian's real estate pros, Douglas Elliman agents Matt and Josh Altman of Million Dollar Listing LA, confirmed to PEOPLE that the estate is for sale once again for $18 million after being sold by the famous couple in November.
The Altman Brothers, whose firm also represents the new seller, tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Marina Acton, shared photos of the home's grounds and interiors that were not part of the listing when Kardashian, 37, and West, 41, were selling.
""When they first bought this home, it had a very Mediterranean feel,"" Josh exclusively told PEOPLE at the time of the sale. ""It's been transformed into a very modern, minimalist style, but so beautiful.""
In fact, the interiors are incredibly stark, with all-white surfaces, stone floors and ultra-modern details.
The kitchen features all stainless-steel appliances including two diswashers, a professional-grade range, and open shelving reminiscent of a restaurant kitchen.
The spartan style is similar to Kardashian and West's new home, a larger mansion in Hidden Hills that is also sparsely furnished and rendered in all white, making it remiscent of a museum or art gallery.
Kardashian recently revealed the extremes she goes to in order to keep the pale furniture that populated this house and their new place clean with three kids - North, 5, Saint, 2, and Chicago, 5 months - running around.
""Oh my God. I run around the house with towels,"" she told archdigest.com. ""You just have to take a deep breath and say, 'Ok, it's going to happen. We decided to have light colors.'""

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's former Bel Air mansion is back on the block, and we've got the exclusive scoop. The famous couple's former pad, which they sold in November, is once again on the market for a cool $18 million.

According to Kardashian's real estate pros, Douglas Elliman agents Matt and Josh Altman of Million Dollar Listing LA, the new seller, tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Marina Acton, is looking to flip the property for a quick profit. The Altman Brothers, who reps Acton, gave us a sneak peek into the luxurious digs, including never-before-seen photos of the private quarters.

""When they first copped this crib, it had a straight-up Mediterranean vibe,"" Josh told us. ""But Kim and Kanye transformed it into a sleek, modern masterpiece. It's a whole different ball game.""

And boy, is it ever. The interior is straight out of a minimalist's playbook, with all-white surfaces, stone floors, and ultra-modern fixtures. The kitchen is a real showstopper, with all stainless-steel appliances, including two dishwashers and a pro-grade range. And let's not forget the open shelving, which gives it a restaurant-kitchen feel.

This sparse style is identical to Kim and Kanye's new Hidden Hills mansion, which is also decked out in all-white everything. We're talking museum-quality, people.

Kim recently spilled the tea on how she keeps the pale furniture clean with three mini-mes running around – North, 5, Saint, 2, and Chicago, 5 months. ""I'm always on the move with towels,"" she told Arch Digest. ""You just gotta take a deep breath and say, 'It's gonna happen. We chose light colors.'""

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star also dished on the design process, saying, ""Kanye and I were the masterminds behind the house. We were super involved in every little detail."" She added, ""The interior design was all about neutral tones and minimal furniture. We even threw in a glam room with its own separate entrance.""

After finding out they were expecting their first kid, they decided the pad wasn't suitable for their growing fam and listed it without ever moving in.

The 9,000-square-foot estate, which the couple purchased for a reported $11 million in 2013, features large automatic windows, a swimming pool with a streamlined stone surround, and sits on 3.5 lush acres in the Bel Air Crest area of LA.

The $17.8 million sale in November made it the priciest house ever sold in the 'hood, according to MLS.

Now, the six-bedroom, eight-bathroom mansion just needs to find a new buyer who digs its unique vibe. Acton, who's expecting a baby, is looking to upgrade to a bigger pad near Miami, complete with a guest house for her parents. She got a personal tour of the estate from Kim herself, and we're guessing she's gonna make a pretty penny on this deal.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of TMZ:

KIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST'S FORMER BEL AIR MANSION IS BACK ON THE MARKET!

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's former Bel Air mansion is back on the market, and we've got the scoop! The estate, which was sold in November, is once again up for grabs for a whopping $18 million.

According to sources, the new owner, tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Marina Acton, is selling the pad just seven months after buying it because she's expecting a baby and wants to upgrade to an even larger house near Miami.

The 9,000-square-foot mansion, which Kim and Kanye bought for a reported $11 million in 2013, features a modern, minimalist design with all-white surfaces, stone floors, and ultra-modern details. The kitchen is straight out of a restaurant, with all stainless-steel appliances, including two dishwashers and a professional-grade range.

But what really sets this house apart is its connection to the outdoors. The large automatic windows seamlessly merge the indoors and out, making it perfect for entertaining. And with 3.5 acres of land in the Bel Air Crest area of Los Angeles, there's plenty of room to roam.

The house, which was previously listed for $18 million, was sold to Acton in November for $17.8 million - more than one-and-a-half times what Kim and Kanye originally paid for it. Now, it's just waiting for a new buyer who appreciates its unique style.

Kim and Kanye's real estate agents, Matt and Josh Altman of Million Dollar Listing LA, confirmed the sale to PEOPLE and shared pics of the home's grounds and interiors that were not part of the original listing.

""When they first bought this home, it had a very Mediterranean feel,"" Josh told PEOPLE. ""It's been transformed into a very modern, minimalist style, but so beautiful.""

Kim previously revealed to ArchDigest.com that she and Kanye were heavily involved in the design process, opting for a ""glam room"" with its own separate entrance. She also shared her tips for keeping the pale furniture clean with three kids running around.

As for Acton, she's said to be selling the house quickly because she wants to buy an even larger pad near Miami, where she'll have a guest house for her parents to stay.

We've gotta say, this house is a real stunner. Who do you think will be the next buyer? Sound off in the comments!","Here is the rewritten document in the style of TMZ:

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's former Bel Air mansion is back on the market, and we've got the exclusive pics of the family's rarely seen private quarters. The power couple's real estate pros, Douglas Elliman agents Matt and Josh Altman of Million Dollar Listing LA, confirmed to us that the estate is for sale once again for a whopping $18 million after being sold by Kimye in November.

The Altman Brothers, whose firm also reps the new seller, tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Marina Acton, shared pics of the home's grounds and interiors that were not part of the listing when Kimye was selling. And let us tell you, it's a real-life museum!

""When they first bought this home, it had a very Mediterranean feel,"" Josh exclusively told us at the time of the sale. ""It's been transformed into a very modern, minimalist style, but so beautiful."" And beautiful it is! The interiors are incredibly stark, with all-white surfaces, stone floors, and ultra-modern details that'll make you feel like you're walking into a art gallery.

The kitchen is straight out of a restaurant, featuring all stainless-steel appliances, including two dishwashers, a professional-grade range, and open shelving that'll make you want to cook up a storm. And the spartan style is similar to Kimye's new home, a larger mansion in Hidden Hills that's also sparsely furnished and rendered in all white.

Kim recently revealed the extremes she goes to in order to keep the pale furniture that populated this house and their new place clean with three kids - North, 5, Saint, 2, and Chicago, 5 months - running around. ""Oh my God. I run around the house with towels,"" she told ArchDigest.com. ""You just have to take a deep breath and say, 'Ok, it's going to happen. We decided to have light colors.'""

1.0,"“Chasing Cars” is a song that’s been used during several pivotal moments over the past 14 seasons Grey’s Anatomy — but its usage in Thursday night’s episode may be its most poignant yet.
Warning: This article contains major spoilers from Thursday’s episode of Grey’s Anatomy. Read at your own risk.
At the end of the series’ first Dia de los Muertos-themed offering, a patient educates Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) about the traditions of the Nov. 1 holiday, which celebrators practice in belief that they can be visited by their deceased loved ones. As Meredith is leaving the hospital, viewers see her former colleague and friend George (T. R. Knight) run around a corner; her mother Ellis (Kate Burton) smiling at her from behind; her dog Doc walking ahead of her down a hallway; her sister Lexie (Chyler Leigh) behind a counter; and her husband Derek (Patrick Dempsey) and his best friend Mark (Eric Dane) watching her as she walks out the door — and it was all set to a Spanish-language version of Snow Patrol’s “Chasing Cars” (performed by MOON&SUN feat. Israel De Corcho) that was commissioned by the Grey’s team specifically for this episode.
The scene was months in the making, and now Grey‘s showrunner Krista Vernoff reveals to EW where the idea came from, what went into making it happen, and why.
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What made you decide to do a Dia de los Muertos episode?We had our air dates before we had our season planned and Kiley Donovan, who wrote [tonight’s] episode, came into the room and said, “Hey, we have an episode that’s airing on Day of the Dead, can we do a Day of the Dead episode?” When you’re brainstorming a season there are things that come with total clarity and my answer was, “Only if all of Meredith’s dead people can visit her.” Okay, not “only if” — I was thrilled by Kiley’s idea to do a Day of the Dead episode.
What went into making those moments happen?We talked about it for four months with the visual effects people. You have to really plan a sequence like that. What I love about that sequence is that we have combined some old footage that aired, some old footage that didn’t air — we pulled old dailies — and we shot some new stuff. Doc, we shot. Ellis, we shot. And the idea of that, for me, is that we don’t know if this is in Meredith’s imagination or memory, or if it’s actually happening. For whatever anybody believes, there is a little bit of something.","We've said it before and we'll say it again: Any time Grey's plays ""Chasing Cars,"" you know you're in for a big ol' sob.
Tonight, ""Chasing Cars"" played in Spanish, to go along with the show's celebration of the Day of the Dead. At first, it just seemed like a typical end-of-episode montage, celebrating the lives saved and mourning the ones lost. But this time, that mourning got extreme, with Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) walking through the hospital and passing by all the loved ones who have died. George (T.R. Knight) was there! Lexie (Chyler Leigh) was there! Derek (Patrick Dempsey) and Mark (Eric Dane) were just chilling there together by an exam table, and Ellis (Kate Burton) was waiting in a hallway, and would you believe we officially lost it when Doc the dog walked past?
That was slightly rude, Grey's Anatomy. Just not something we were emotionally prepared for in that moment.
Meredith spent the episode reeling from news that her father is in hospice and dying of cancer. She didn't know if she should go say goodbye or not, since he wasn't exactly a father to her over the years.
She was also dealing with two guys vying for her affections--DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti), still nursing his crush, and Link (Chris Carmack), encouraged by Jo (Camilla Luddington). She ended the episode cutting Link's hair after discovering Jo trying and failing to do the same with a beer in her hand. What that means, we'll have to find out.
Also: Teddy did not manage to tell Owen about the baby, so that's going to have to wait once again!
Anyway, if you need us, we will be watching that montage another 27 times.",Ew,Eonline,"Here is the rewritten document:

Get ready to dive back into the world of Grey's Anatomy! The latest episode of the long-running medical drama featured a familiar tune in a poignant way.

**SPOILER ALERT**: If you haven't caught up on the latest episode, proceed with caution.

As the show celebrated its first Dia de los Muertos-themed episode, a patient educated Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) about the traditions of the Nov. 1 holiday. The twist? Believers think they can be visited by their deceased loved ones. Fast-forward to the end of the episode, and viewers witnessed a heart-stopping sequence: Meredith's former colleague and friend George (T. R. Knight) running around a corner, her mom Ellis (Kate Burton) smiling at her, her dog Doc walking ahead, her sister Lexie (Chyler Leigh) behind a counter, and her husband Derek (Patrick Dempsey) and his best friend Mark (Eric Dane) watching her leave the hospital. The pièce de résistance? It was all set to a Spanish-language version of Snow Patrol's ""Chasing Cars"" (performed by MOON&SUN feat. Israel De Corcho), specifically commissioned for this episode by the Grey's team.

Grey's Anatomy showrunner Krista Vernoff dished to EW about the idea behind this emotional episode and what went into making it happen.

**EW:** What inspired you to tackle a Dia de los Muertos episode? 
**Krista Vernoff:** We had our air dates locked in before we planned the season, and writer Kiley Donovan pitched the idea: ""Hey, we have an episode airing on Day of the Dead – can we do a Day of the Dead episode?"" I was thrilled by the idea, especially when Kiley suggested that all of Meredith's dead people could visit her.

**EW:** What was the process like to bring those emotional moments to life? 
**Krista Vernoff:** We spent four months brainstorming with the visual effects team. You have to meticulously plan a sequence like that. I love that we combined old footage, some of which aired, some that didn't, and even shot new scenes. Doc, for instance, was filmed specifically for this episode. The idea is that we're not sure if this is Meredith's imagination, memory, or reality. It's up to the viewer to decide.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Eonline:

The director celebrated his Academy Award win for Life of Pi in the juiciest way possible: standing on the street with his Oscar in one hand and a burger in the other.

1.0,"Late Night host Jimmy Fallon, clearly sensing that the internet was suffering from a lack of “Call Me Maybe” covers, has just released a new version of the song along with his house band The Roots and Carly Rae Jepsen herself, who was a guest on his show last night.
Instead of reproducing the track’s bouncy synths, the backstage crew took a more elementary (school) approach and played classroom instruments — bongo, xylophone, melodica, tone block, and even a triangle — to bring the song a fresh, wonky energy.
You know, Jimmy Fallon, this is why we love you.","“Call Me Maybe” has been simmering at No. 2 for weeks now, it’s the morning show peppy interstitial music of choice, and even computer–Barack Obama has joined the cause. It’s a real phenomenon! But if you were holding out for a Cool People endorsement (and if James Franco does not qualify), then your time has come: Jimmy Fallon and The Roots are onboard. They even made a video with Carly last night, before her Fallon appearance, and honestly, it is so charming, even if you are not a “Call Me Maybe” devotee. Just wait till the chorus comes in and Questlove pops in with the weird baguette drum. (They only used schoolroom instruments.) There’s a rainbow xylophone, too. And a recorder joke! We’ve kept you too long, please just enjoy.",Ew,Vulture,"Here's the rewritten document:

One thing Jimmy Fallon has in common with Carly Rae Jepsen? They both make a damn good ""Call Me Maybe."" At least that's according to a new video from The Tonight Show, where Fallon and his house band The Roots, along with Jepsen herself, who was a guest on the show last night, brought the song a fresh, wonky energy.

The backstory here is that the internet was clearly suffering from a lack of ""Call Me Maybe"" covers, and Fallon, sensing this, decided to take matters into his own hands. Instead of reproducing the track's bouncy synths, the backstage crew took a more elementary (school) approach and played classroom instruments — bongo, xylophone, melodica, tone block, and even a triangle — to bring the song a fresh, wonky energy. You know, Jimmy Fallon, this is why we love you.

The question on everyone's mind is: what's the secret to this cover's success? Is it the bongo drums? The xylophone? The tone block? We may never know, but one thing's for sure: it's a recipe that's definitely ""worth staying up late for."" 

Fallon's social media doesn't give many clues as to how he came up with this idea, but we do know that he's been experimenting with music on his show for a while now. In 2013, he released a music album with his house band, and it's clear that he's been itching to get back to his musical roots. 

One of the best clues may be his recent appearances on late-night TV, where he's been making waves with his comedy and music. Per a recent report, he's been ""plotting"" to make a comeback to the music scene, and it looks like this ""Call Me Maybe"" cover is just the beginning. 

We may never know the full recipe behind this cover, but one thing's for sure: it's a game-changer. So, Jimmy, if you ever want to give us a behind-the-scenes look at how you came up with this idea, we're all ears.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Vulture:

Jimmy Fallon's latest stunt is an oldie but a goodie: a ""Call Me Maybe"" cover, this time with Carly Rae Jepsen herself and The Roots. But here's the twist: instead of busting out the synthesizers, the crew opted for a more elementary approach - as in, elementary school. Bongos, xylophones, and a triangle, oh my! The result is a delightfully wonky take on the earworm.

Fallon's antics never fail to bring a smile, and this one's no exception. Who else but Jimmy would think to rethink a pop classic with classroom instruments? It's a testament to his bubbly personality and ability to bring out the kid in all of us.

In this rendition, Jepsen's signature sugary sweet vocals are paired with The Roots' funky beats, making for a thoroughly entertaining listen. And let's be real, that triangle solo is everything. It's a match made in heaven, people.

So, what do you think? Is this unconventional cover a hit or a miss? Let us know in the comments.

It's a move that's equal parts absurd and delightful, like a reality-TV classic, a bread-and-butter edit for a Real Housewives meltdown.

Fallon's decision to release this cover is a testament to his ability to tap into the cultural zeitgeist. He's like a producer on The Bachelor, sensing the moment and capitalizing on it. And in this case, the moment is our collective nostalgia for ""Call Me Maybe."" The song's bouncy, upbeat melody is the perfect antidote to our current cultural malaise, and Fallon's decision to release a new version is a clever move.

But what's most interesting about this cover is the way it subverts our expectations. Instead of reproducing the original's bouncy synths, the backstage crew opted for a more low-fi approach, using classroom instruments to create a fresh, wonky energy. It's a move that's both playful and irreverent, like a wink to the audience. And it's a testament to Fallon's ability to think outside the box and create something truly unique.

In the end, Fallon's ""Call Me Maybe"" cover is a delightful surprise, a breath of fresh air in a cultural landscape that's often too serious and too self-important. It's a reminder that sometimes, all we need is a little bit of fun and a little bit of wonkiness to brighten up our day. So, here's to Jimmy Fallon, the king of late-night TV, and his ability to tap into the cultural zeitgeist and create something truly special."

1.0,"AMERICAN HORROR STORY Season 3 Episode 7 Recap. A recap of the seventh episode of FX's AMERICAN HORROR STORY: COVEN, starring Jessica Lange.
While last week's episode of FX's American Horror Story: Coven was a bit of a departure in terms of advancing the plot, things got back on track for all concerned this week.  The conflict between the witches and the voodoo priestesses jumped up a notch in this episode with an unexpected betrayal and a reconciling of old grievances.  Relationships within the coven are just as treacherous as truths are revealed, bonds are broken and then reforged again in the strangest of ways.  Hit the jump for my recap and review.
This week's episode ""The Dead"" kicks things off with a Millennial monologue from the recently revived Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts).  Death seems to have done little to change her disposition as she's still in search of the next fix, in whatever form that may be.  In this case, the particular fix is found in another reanimated character: FrankenKyle (Evan Peters).  Peters actually gets to speak in more than just grunts and growls this time around, as we flash back to his pre-accident days when he had aspirations of becoming a respectable engineer.  FrankenKyle's story is sad enough without us learning that his current mental state is likely a hodgepodge of memories and inclinations cobbled together from his stereotypical fraternity brothers. Tragic.  I thought for a moment that Zoe (Taissa Farmiga) and Madison might have been in conflict over the love triangle, but then I remembered that this is American Horror Story and they can just pave over that ill will with a two-thirds undead three-way.
Zoe was up to more than just double-dipping in necrophilia, however.  After being informed by Cordelia (Sarah Paulson) that Fiona (Jessica Lange) was the one responsible for Madison's death and would likely be going after Zoe next, the possible new Supreme decided that she needed to hear the confession from the horse's mouth, so to speak.  And speak he did, as Zoe magically reattached Spalding (Denis O'Hare) and his estranged tongue ... briefly.  When she got what she needed out of him, Zoe put a blade into Spalding, but as we've seen so far this season, death is merely a temporary inconvenience, so he may yet return.
A new character proved his worth this week in Danny Huston's Axeman.  Last week's introduction of this historically accurate (thank you, fact checkers!) jazz-loving serial killer appeared to muddy the waters, but his backstory as a longtime (and insanely creepy) admirer of Fiona was an interesting twist.  Just how their noir-y relationship plays out in the end remains to be seen, but it gives the Supreme an additional ally for what has been a one-woman battle thus far.
Ah, and now we get to the crux of this week's big story surprise: Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe) and Delphine LaLaurie (Kathy Bates).  Just when it seemed like Queenie was bringing Delphine ever so slowly into contemporary times (thanks to fast food and bedazzled tiger sweatshirts), the former betrays the latter and turns her over to Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett).  So now we've got Cordelia and Zoe out to take Fiona down, and Queenie siding with the voodoo priestess and possibly abandoning her witchy sisters.  It's still anyone's guess as to who will emerge the victor in this battle, but a lot of blood is sure to be spilled along the way.
Getting a shitty tattoo is bad enough, but having multiple shitty tattoos forced upon you is just awful.
Oh hey, Hank (Josh Hamilton).  What a lovely gun collection you have!
FrankenKyle banging Madison up against the wardrobe was classic AHS.
Fiona’s not looking to good as her hair continues to come out in clumps.  I'm glad that sexy jazz music stopped her from shaving her head.
I think this is the first time since the first (or maybe second) episode that they've mentioned Zoe's latent sex-to-death power.","We are now over halfway through this season, and boy, are the grits hitting the fan. This episode was written by co-creator Brad Falchuk, and he injected it with his usual mixture of humor, awe, and dark, dark tomfoolery.
Axeman Bourdain and Fiona are taking their relationship to the next level — or, at least, to the apartment of a porkpie-hat–wearing piano player who the Axeman has disposed in the apartment’s bathtub. Over bourbon and jazz music, the Axeman explains that a typical musician in the olden days was “poor, indigent, and had to be content being a backdoor man.” (This sounds like my present days.) He quotes As I Lay Dying: “The reason for living is to get ready to stay dead for a long time.” “You’re not just any broke-down sax man; you’re a college-educated one. Are you James Franco?” replies Fiona (emphasis mine).
Fiona continues to find patches of her hair falling out and resists the Axeman. But he continues to “Hot damn!” his way into her good graces until the two kiss passionately. Fiona pulls away, claiming that she only pursued him because she was out of sleeping pills. She calls herself “a wretched human being,” with three ex-husbands and ruined relationships all around. But the Axeman persists, proffering “good, old-fashioned sex” by way of his highly oral saxophone skills. “You’re good at this,” Fiona allows, and then they proceed to have axeman-witch sex until a lightbulb bursts. Isn’t that just the way?
Madison is feeling very existential these days, unfurling a monologue about millennials and ascribing her “numbness to the world” to the entitlement that her generation embodies. “Hell, I was gang-raped, and two days later, I was back in class like nothing happened.” “Class” might be an overstatement at Miss Robichaux’s School for Kitchen Chatter. “How can anything be worse than this eternal silence inside of me?” she says, quoting the set of this show because where in holy swampwater springs is Patti LuPone?
In flashback, we see that Kyle once had a bright future in mind. While fangirling to Toto’s “Rosanna” and overseeing the unfortunate tattooing of his frat brothers at a nearby parlor, he said that, after the destruction of Hurricane Katrina, he wanted to become a civil engineer. But obviously, Madison’s vengeful spell has intervened, and now Kyle, made of his frat boys’ appendages, is saddled with the gaudy shamrock and Chinese characters of their choosing. That’s brutal, bro.
Zoe, wielding Madison’s pistol, approaches her chain-bound beau with the intent to shoot him, but FrankenKyle, easily swiping the gun from her, puts the barrel into his mouth. Zoe stops him. Later, while Zoe tries to give FrankenKyle an ESL class on how to communicate — FrankenKyle eating oatmeal like he’s in Beauty and the Beast — Madison shows up, telling Zoe, “Cordelia wants to see you. Well, that would be impossible, but she does want to talk.” While Zoe is away, Madison, conveniently remembering how she helped make FrankenKyle, praises “the best parts” that she picked out for him, then underscores their common bond now that they have both died. Thus, like the Jenners long ago, two people who are equally dead inside fall for each other. Later, when Zoe returns, she finds FrankenKyle, rump re-exposed, slamming Madison against an armoire. “How embarrassing!” chimes the actual Armoire from Beauty and the Beast.
But all is not lost: When Zoe emerges from the shower, Madison confesses that sex with FrankenKyle is the first time that she’s felt truly alive since her death. “You brought the dude back to life; you must like him a little,” Madison says, to which Zoe deadpans, “I brought you back, too.” In fact, given Zoe’s Death Star, Madison thinks that sex with dead people might be her only option. So Zoe is led to bed, where Kyle and Madison both reach their hands out to her. The camera pans down to their feet, where Zoe’s towel falls before she climbs aboard. Now showing: Threesome 2: Dead Man’s Chest.
Hank, who owns as many guns as Ted Nugent, calls Delia “in tears.” Afterwards, while fumbling around in the night, Delia (starting to look like a Buffy vampire) almost falls down the stairs until she grasps onto Madison. Now, via her Sight, Delia learns not only that Madison is revived but that Fiona killed her. She tells Zoe, “Fiona Goode has been on the same side her whole life — her own,” sounding like Madonna in Dick Tracy. “If she even thinks you’re next, you’re next.” Delia proposes that they finally do away with Fiona: “Kill her once; kill her good; kill her dead.” When did Delia start working for Orkin?
There’s nothing to eat in the house, so new besties Queenie and Delphine make a late-night trip to Frostop’s. Delphine says that it’s the best food that she’s had in her insanely long life, then says, “I’m starting to understand why you’re so enormous.” Queenie: “I dragged my ass all the way here from Detroit to be with my, quote, ‘sister witches,’ and instead, I’m sitting in a fast food parking lot at three in the morning with an immortal racist.” (Ten points, Falchuk.) Delphine says that the other witches will never see Queenie as their sister because she is black, though Queenie remains doubtful of this.
Queenie visits a gumbo-preparing Marie Laveau, who croaks that the Salem witches probably serve “Shake ’n Bake and watermelon for dessert.” Queenie reasserts that her skin color has nothing to do with their treatment, but Laveau insists on the opposite — and reveals to Queenie that Fiona was the one who dug up Delphine. Laveau offers Queenie a home among her fellow voodoo witches, the price of admission being Delphine herself.
Hold up, ‘Phinie. Queenie tricks her into visiting Cornrow City under the pretense of getting a new haircut while Delphine wears a hideous tiger T-shirt — but it is into Laveau’s clutches that Queenie delivers her. After having confined Delphine to a cage, Laveau asks Queenie to make the first cut so that Laveau might apply her “Retin-A.” And so we end with Laveau, assuming Delphine’s skincare pose from the premiere, as she spreads Delphine’s blood around her already flawless face.
Is this really the end of Spalding? Was that Delphine’s pancreas, or just blood? Is the Axeman truly smitten with Fiona, or is it a trick? All I know is that I’ve never craved anything like I do a strawberry cyclone with Kathy Bates.",Collider,Vulture,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document:

AMERICAN HORROR STORY: COVEN - A Bloody Reckoning

American Horror Story: Coven's seventh episode, ""The Dead,"" is a gruesome return to form after last week's meandering detour. The witches and voodoo priestesses are now at each other's throats, with old allegiances fraying and new rivalries simmering. In this blood-soaked episode, the body count rises, and the stakes are higher than ever.

The episode begins with a monologue from the recently resurrected Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts), still as petulant as ever. Her search for the next thrill leads her to FrankenKyle (Evan Peters), another reanimated corpse with a tragic backstory. Peters finally gets to speak more than just grunts and growls, and we're treated to a heartbreaking flashback of his pre-accident life as a would-be engineer. But even that's tainted by the revelation that his current mental state is a Frankenstein's monster of memories cobbled together from his frat bros. Tragic, indeed.

Meanwhile, Zoe (Taissa Farmiga) is playing a dangerous game. After learning that Fiona (Jessica Lange) was responsible for Madison's death and would likely come for her next, Zoe decides to confront the Supreme. But not before she magically reattaches Spalding's (Denis O'Hare) tongue - briefly, anyway. When she gets what she needs, she puts a blade in Spalding, but as we've seen this season, death is just a temporary inconvenience. He might yet return to wreak havoc.

A new character emerges as a game-changer: Danny Huston's Axeman, a historically accurate jazz-loving serial killer with a twisted backstory. His noir-ish relationship with Fiona adds an interesting layer to the plot, and it's anyone's guess how it will play out.

The real kicker, though, is the betrayal between Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe) and Delphine LaLaurie (Kathy Bates). Just when it seems like Queenie is bringing Delphine into the modern age, she turns her over to Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett). Now we've got Cordelia and Zoe gunning for Fiona, and Queenie joining forces with the voodoo priestess. The battle lines are drawn, and it's anyone's guess who will emerge victorious.

• Hank's (Josh Hamilton) gun collection is a thing of beauty, but what's the point of having all those guns if you can't even use them?
• That awkward FrankenKyle-Madison moment against the wardrobe? Classic AHS.
• Fiona's not looking too well, with her hair falling out in clumps. I'm glad she didn't shave her head - that would be a tragedy.
• It's been ages since we've seen Zoe's power to kill with sex. Good to see it's still in working order.

This episode is a bloody reckoning, with alliances shattered and bodies piling up. Who will survive the coven's civil war? Only time will tell.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Vulture:

AMERICAN HORROR STORY Season 3 Episode 7 Recap

The seventh episode of FX's American Horror Story: Coven finally got things back on track after last week's departure from the central plot. This week's installment saw tensions escalating between the witches and voodoo priestesses, culminating in an unexpected betrayal and a reckoning of old scores. Within the coven, relationships proved just as treacherous as the truths being revealed, with bonds broken and reforged in the most unexpected ways. Hit the jump for my recap and review.

This week's episode, ""The Dead,"" kicked off with a Millennial monologue from the recently revived Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts). Death, it seemed, had done little to change her disposition, and she was still on the hunt for the next fix - in whatever form that may take. This time around, it came in the form of another reanimated character: FrankenKyle (Evan Peters). Peters finally got to speak in more than just grunts and growls, as we flashed back to his pre-accident days when he had aspirations of becoming a respectable engineer. FrankenKyle's story was tragic enough without us learning that his current mental state is likely a hodgepodge of memories and inclinations cobbled together from his stereotypical fraternity brothers.

Meanwhile, Zoe (Taissa Farmiga) was up to more than just-double dipping in necrophilia. After being informed by Cordelia (Sarah Paulson) that Fiona (Jessica Lange) was responsible for Madison's death and would likely be coming for Zoe next, the possible new Supreme decided she needed to hear the confession from the horse's mouth. So, she magically reattached Spalding (Denis O'Hare) and his estranged tongue... briefly. When she got what she needed out of him, Zoe put a blade into Spalding, but as we've seen so far this season, death is merely a temporary inconvenience, so he may yet return.

A new character proved his worth this week in Danny Huston's Axeman. Last week's introduction of this historically accurate jazz-loving serial killer seemed to muddy the waters, but his backstory as a longtime (and insanely creepy) admirer of Fiona was an interesting twist. Just how their noir-y relationship plays out in the end remains to be seen, but it gives the Supreme an additional ally in what has been a one-woman battle thus far.

And now we get to the crux of this week's big story surprise: Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe) and Delphine LaLaurie (Kathy Bates). Just when it seemed like Queenie was bringing Delphine ever so slowly into contemporary times (thanks to fast food and bedazzled tiger sweatshirts), the former betrays the latter and turns her over to Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett). So now we've got Cordelia and Zoe out to take Fiona down, and Queenie siding with the voodoo priestess and possibly abandoning her witchy sisters. It's still anyone's guess as to who will emerge victorious in this battle, but a lot of blood is sure to be spilled along the way.

Some notable moments from this week's episode: Getting a shitty tattoo is bad enough, but having multiple shitty tattoos forced upon you is just awful. Oh hey, Hank (Josh Hamilton) - what a lovely gun collection you have! FrankenKyle banging Madison up against the wardrobe was classic AHS. Fiona's not looking too good as her hair continues to come out in clumps. I'm glad that sexy jazz music stopped her from shaving her head. And I think this is the first time since the first (or maybe second) episode that they've mentioned Zoe's latent sex-to-death power.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Vulture:

**AMERICAN HORROR STORY: COVEN** - Episode 7 Recap: ""The Dead""

This week's installment of FX's **American Horror Story: Coven** was a wild ride, folks. After last week's detour, the plot was back on track, and we got a healthy dose of betrayal, reconciliation, and good old-fashioned witchy drama.

The episode kicked off with a monologue from the recently resurrected Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts), who's still searching for her next fix - in this case, a reanimated FrankenKyle (Evan Peters). Peters finally got to speak in more than just grunts and growls, and we flashed back to his pre-accident days as a wannabe engineer. Tragic, right? But let's be real, this is **American Horror Story**, and we know that love triangles can be resolved with a good old-fashioned undead threesome.

Meanwhile, Zoe (Taissa Farmiga) was up to more than just necrophilia. After Cordelia (Sarah Paulson) spilled the tea about Fiona's (Jessica Lange) role in Madison's demise, Zoe decided to get the confession straight from the horse's mouth - or rather, Spalding's (Denis O'Hare) reattached tongue. When she got what she needed, Zoe put a blade in Spalding, but we all know death is just a temporary inconvenience in this show.

Newcomer Danny Huston's Axeman proved his worth this week, bringing a creepy jazz-loving serial killer vibe to the table. His backstory as a longtime admirer of Fiona added an interesting twist to the mix, and we're curious to see how their noir-y relationship plays out.

But the real kicker was Queenie's (Gabourey Sidibe) betrayal of Delphine LaLaurie (Kathy Bates). Just when it seemed like Queenie was bringing Delphine into the 21st century, she turned her over to Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett). Now we've got Cordelia and Zoe gunning for Fiona, and Queenie siding with the voodoo priestess. It's anyone's guess who'll come out on top, but one thing's for sure - there'll be blood.

Oh, and let's not forget the random moments of awesomeness: Hank's (Josh Hamilton) gun collection, FrankenKyle banging Madison against the wardrobe, and Fiona's hair loss (thankfully, that sexy jazz music stopped her from shaving her head).

This episode was a wild ride, and we're still reeling from the aftermath. Who's ready for next week's installment?"
1.0,"Take a little time to enjoy this tea!
Excitement is building for the release of a new book titled Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of The View. Written by Variety's New York bureau chief Ramin Setoodeh, the project takes an inside look into ABC's long-running daytime talk show.
Lucky for pop culture fans, many current and former co-hosts agreed to participate in the project. And yes, they're ready to talk.
In a new excerpt from the book first posted by Vulture, Jenny McCarthy opens up about her experience as the eleventh co-host on the show.
And although she only appeared for one season between 2013-2014, that doesn't mean Jenny has little to share. We're taking a look at just some of her shocking claims that may just become the next ""Hot Topic.""
Gone Too Soon: Jenny's arrival to the talk show came on the heels of Elisabeth Hasselbeck leaving the show. According to Jenny, some producers wished the outspoken republican had stayed at the table longer. ""They did try to change me. They wanted Elisabeth back, and I wasn't Elisabeth. I would literally have meetings before the show of them trying to input opinions in me to go against Whoopi,"" she claimed. ""I was going to work crying. I couldn't be myself. Every day I went home and I was miserable. It really was the most miserable I've been on a job in my twenty-five years of show business.""
How Do I Look? It's no secret that the ladies of The View have some help in the fashion department thanks to stylists and glam squads. But according to Jenny, Barbara was always much more curious to see what she was wearing. ""Barbara would check out what I was wearing. If she didn't agree with it, or it didn't complement her outfit, I had to change,"" The Masked Singer judge shared. ""Mind you, she doesn't look at anyone's clothes but mine. There were times when she'd say change, and she'd make people run out and get that dress in her size. I was a human Barbie doll.""
Family Feud: If you ever wondered if Barbara Walters and Whoopi Goldberg got along away from the cameras, we may have an answer. ""The table reminds me a little bit of Survivor. There was a war between Barbara and Whoopi about Barbara wanting to moderate. This is one of the reasons I decided not to ally with Whoopi,"" Jenny explained in the book. ""It broke my heart when Barbara would shuffle to Whoopi and say, ‘Can I moderate please?' And Whoopi would say no.""
Bad Reviews: Jenny became a real-life ""Hot Topic"" when she released her book Louder Than Words: A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism. In the book, Jenny argued that vaccines weakened her son's immune system and possibly triggered his autism. It's a claim Barbara strongly disagreed with, according to the author. ""I walked into her dressing room and she blew up at me,"" Jenny recalled when visiting as a guest. ""She was screaming, ‘How dare you say this! That autism can be cured?' My knees were shaking. I remember my whole body was shaking…This lasted for about seven minutes. Finally, someone pulled me out of the room. I went back to my dressing room, not knowing what the f--k to do. One of my heroes just chewed me a new asshole, and I'm going on live TV.""
A Better Offer: According to Ramin, Jenny pursued an opportunity with CBS for her own daytime show that would be filmed in Chicago where she lived with her son. One of her concerns, however, was that she would become another celebrity with a flop in the afternoon. ""I would rather be on a show that's established,"" she told herself. Ultimately, she went with ABC. And if the network couldn't have gotten Jenny, comedian Ali Wentworth was another option.
E! News has reached out to Barbara's team for comment. And for more juicy stories, make sure to read Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of The View available nationwide on April 2.","Excerpted with permission from the book Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of “The View,” to be published by St. Martin’s Press on April 2.

As the 11th co-host on The View, Jenny McCarthy found herself in a horror movie. She took the job expecting to bring some humor to Hot Topics, but that wasn’t possible given the atmosphere on the set. Barbara Walters was in despair that she was retiring, and she made it clear that she didn’t want to go quietly. Whoopi Goldberg had no patience for Barbara’s clinging to whatever power she had left. And ABC bosses soon realized that they had accidentally dumped what had made The View successful — the panel’s fire and ice.
Her publicity tour took her all the way to The View. Before the interview, a producer told Jenny that Barbara wanted to speak to her.
Jenny responded that she never used the word cured to describe Evan’s condition. That didn’t matter. “You’re such a liar!” Barbara screamed.
“This lasted for about seven minutes,” Jenny said. “Finally, someone pulled me out of the room. I went back to my dressing room, not knowing what the fuck to do. One of my heroes just chewed me a new asshole, and I’m going on live TV. I’m freaking the fuck out.” The producer told her that Barbara didn’t want Jenny to walk onto the set as a guest because that would prompt the audience to clap. Instead, the interview began with Jenny on the couch, wedged between the ladies, with the camera on Barbara for an introduction.
As she waited for an offer, she pursued an opportunity with CBS for her own daytime show. It would be filmed in Chicago, where she lived with Evan, but Jenny didn’t want to become another celebrity with a flop in the afternoon. She believed, perhaps naïvely, that there would be more job security on The View. “I would rather be on a show that’s established,” she told herself.
That summer, in 2013, CBS tried to get her to sign with them. Jenny called Geddie on the July 4 weekend to let him know that she was about to accept the deal.
Geddie had been trying to find the perfect co-host to replace Joy and Elisabeth Hasselbeck, to bring more pop-culture expertise to The View. Since the network wanted the show to steer clear of politics, the new hire would need to be fluent in celebrity gossip and reality TV, such as The Bachelor and Dancing With the Stars. That was the winning formula on The Talk, which still trailed The View in the ratings. Geddie had tested Brooke Shields for the new seat, but market research revealed that viewers found her too stiff. “I liked her,” Geddie said. “For some reason, our audience never warmed to her.” Another option: the comedian Ali Wentworth, from In Living Color, who was married to GMA co-anchor George Stephanopoulos.
On July 15, Barbara cheerfully introduced Jenny as the latest co-host on The View, an announcement that was met with an avalanche of negative press. Many critics thought that by hiring Jenny the show was giving her a platform to spread wrong information to parents about not vaccinating their children. Media outlets that didn’t normally cover daytime TV, such as the Columbia Journalism Review and The Nation, voiced their disapproval.
During another show, Jenny referred to herself in the third person, telling a story about meeting a fan. “Who is Jenny McCarthy?” Barbara asked on TV.
At the start of the season, Jenny had visited Whoopi’s house, thinking they could maybe be friends. “I loved her in Ghost,” Jenny said. “I’m a fan. I thought I was going to work with the Whoopi that people thought they might know — fun and funny.” But Whoopi didn’t warm to Jenny. “The table is an interesting dynamic because it reminds me a little bit of Survivor. There were allies, and there weren’t many people to choose from. Do I side with Barbara, who is royalty, but she’s leaving? Or do I take Whoopi, who is a force to be reckoned with?” Jenny aligned with Sherri Shepherd, knowing that they had similar personalities as moms with young boys. Jenny didn’t want to build a friendship out of a power grab.
Barbara’s fixation on the moderator’s chair turned into an unhealthy obsession. In conversations with the staff, Barbara loved to complain about all the dif­ferent ways Whoopi had botched an introduction or mixed up facts. Whoopi resented that Barbara was trying to run her over. “Whoopi was very angry,” said Jenny. “She was angry that she wasn’t being paid what she was worth, rightfully so.” Whoopi had always tried to be a team player, but she felt that ABC wasn’t treating her like a valued employee. One idea she had, to do a live version of Sister Act as a prime-time musical (like NBC’s Sound of Music Live!, starring Carrie Underwood), was turned down by Paul Lee, the president of ABC Entertainment Group. The network hadn’t even offered Whoopi a raise for keeping The View afloat.
In the past, Barbara hadn’t paid much attention to the other co-hosts’ wardrobes, but this became a new tic for her. “We would all show up in the makeup room,” Jenny said. “Barbara would check out what I was wearing. If she didn’t agree with it, or it didn’t complement her outfit, I had to change.” Jenny estimated that over the next seven months she switched 50 outfits as a result of Barbara’s withering gaze, as if they were doing a photo shoot at Vogue instead of a daytime talk show.
Barbara would object to Jenny’s choosing a summer dress on a cold day. “What the hell are you wearing?” Barbara asked her about a sleeveless outfit by designer Victoria Beckham.
One morning that autumn, Jenny answered the door to her dressing room. Barbara was very upset about something she’d seen in the communal bathroom. She wasn’t trying to be mean to Jenny. But she needed to express her disapproval — and she’d lost her bearings.
As The View went back to a disaster zone, the network rang the alarm bells. At least under Rosie, the show was a ratings phenomenon. With Jenny at the table, people were turning it off. “We didn’t bring the numbers up that year,” Geddie said. “They blamed everyone but themselves. The idea that a show has legacies to maintain, this was lost on them.” Without politics, The View had lost its edge and felt like every other copycat talk show.
If all this weren’t hard enough, Barbara’s health continued to deteriorate. One day, just as the show ended, she collapsed into the arms of a stage manager. She had to be taken to the greenroom, where they laid her down on a sofa. The staff called the paramedics. But Barbara, concerned that the sight of her on a stretcher would make it into the papers, instructed them to take her to her dressing room. Once inside, she locked the door and wouldn’t let anyone in. “Barbara, are you okay?” they pleaded. She finally came out to be taken to the doctor. The next day, Barbara acted like it was business as usual.
That spring, Barbara pleaded with Whoopi one more time to allow her to moderate The View for her final days on TV. Whoopi wouldn’t budge — she wasn’t forfeiting her ground. When Barbara tried to go over her head by complaining to the ABC brass, Whoopi referred them to a clause in her contract that afforded her the show’s sole moderator duties.
The viewers who grew up with Barbara could tell that it was time for her to let go.

Ladies Who Punch: The Inside Story of The View

In an upcoming book, Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of The View, Variety's New York bureau chief Ramin Setoodeh delves into the behind-the-scenes politics of ABC's long-running daytime talk show. The book, which features interviews with current and former co-hosts, offers a candid look at the show's inner workings.

One of the co-hosts who participated in the project is Jenny McCarthy, who served as the show's eleventh co-host for a single season between 2013-2014. In an excerpt from the book, McCarthy reveals the challenges she faced during her tenure, including pressure from producers to emulate her predecessor, Elisabeth Hasselbeck. ""They did try to change me. They wanted Elisabeth back, and I wasn't Elisabeth,"" McCarthy claimed. ""I was going to work crying. I couldn't be myself. Every day I went home and I was miserable. It really was the most miserable I've been on a job in my twenty-five years of show business.""

McCarthy also details the fashion dynamics on the show, particularly with regard to Barbara Walters. ""Barbara would check out what I was wearing. If she didn't agree with it, or it didn't complement her outfit, I had to change,"" McCarthy said. ""Mind you, she doesn't look at anyone's clothes but mine.

There was a war between Barbara and Whoopi about Barbara wanting to moderate. This is one of the reasons I decided not to ally with Whoopi,"" McCarthy explained.

McCarthy's memoir, Louder Than Words: A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism, sparked controversy when it was released, particularly with regard to her claims that vaccines weakened her son's immune system and possibly triggered his autism. Walters, according to McCarthy, was vehemently opposed to these claims. ""I walked into her dressing room and she blew up at me,"" McCarthy recalled. ""She was screaming, 'How dare you say this! That autism can be cured?' My knees were shaking. I remember my whole body was shaking…This lasted for about seven minutes. Finally, someone pulled me out of the room.

Gone Too Soon: Jenny's arrival on The View came on the heels of Elisabeth Hasselbeck's departure, and it seems some producers were still holding out hope for the outspoken republican's return. ""They did try to change me. They wanted Elisabeth back, and I wasn't Elisabeth.

In a new excerpt from Ramin Setoodeh's book, Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of The View, Jenny opens up about her experience on the show, and it's a wild ride.

Jenny's arrival on the show came on the heels of Elisabeth Hasselbeck's departure, and according to Jenny, some producers were still pining for the outspoken Republican.

1.0,"After weeks of swirling speculation, TikTok sensation Alix Earle and football player Braxton Berrios have seemingly confirmed their relationship. At the 2023 ESPY Awards, honoring greatness in athletic achievement, the duo walked the red carpet hand-in-hand.
Earle rocked a strapless leather dress, which was feminine but edgy. With her hair half up and half down, Earle shimmered with her glossy lips and dramatic smokey eye. Topped off with a statement earring and Steve Madden heels, the look was simple but daring.
Berrios, who is a wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins, sported a classic light pink suit. While the look was classic menswear, the color choice reminded just a bit of the fervent Barbie-mania.
Always one to document her life, Earle took to TikTok to showcase her getting ready for the ceremony. This included her initial glam, getting her hair styled, and one final video to show off the outfit.
“Just going today as a plus-one,” Earle said in a TikTok before the ceremony. “You guys can probably guess who I’m going with.
While Earle and Berrios’ relationship has been an open secret for the past month, the ESPY Awards provides one of the first instances that the pair have publicly appeared together. Fans have suspected a growing relationship from Earle’s TikTok feed, as she posts increasingly loved-up clips.
Back in June, the couple posted a TikTok to Earle’s page of them cooking and enjoying a romantic date night. At the beginning of the clip, the pair cozied up next to each other on a balcony that overlooked Miami’s Biscayne Bay at sunset.
Still, it’s been a rocky road for the couple to reach their ESPY Awards hard launch. Before Earle, Berrios dated Sofia Culpo, star of TLC’s The Culpo Sisters. On June 27, as rumors of Earle and Berrios’ relationship began to leak, Culpo took to TikTok to shade her ex.
“Give it a few but call me when the love bombing ends,” Culpo captioned her TikTok, before using the hashtags #girltok and #narcredflag.
Culpo would go on to delete the post, sharing a TikTok story detailing her reaction. “I'm sorry the internet has their panties in a wad. It wasn't that deep,"" she said. ""It really wasn't that deep. I'm literally getting texts from my friends like, 'I'm thinking of you, are you doing okay?' I'm good. I'm good. The internet is wild, but we're good.""
Even if it “wasn’t that deep,” Berrios still felt the need to comment on Culpo’s claims. ""I genuinely want all of this to be over and everybody to move on and do whatever makes them happy,"" Berrios wrote on his Instagram Story. ""I was in a relationship for two years. It was a good relationship. It was a healthy one. And towards the end of it, we had conversations along the lines of we just weren’t working out.""","This relationship just went viral.
Alix Earle debuted her new romance with Braxton Berrios on the ESPYS 2023 red carpet July 12.
The TikTok star rocked a strapless, brown leather dress with Steve Madden black heels, while the Miami Dolphins player sported a light pink suit and a white button-up shirt to the award ceremony, which honored the best and brightest athletes of the year.
Alix and Braxton's outing comes a month after they were spotted out at the Palm Tree Music Festival in Westhampton, N.Y. A photo of the pair at a party was posted on the event's official Instagram page June 24.
That same weekend, Alix soft launched her relationship with the wide receiver. In a TikTok video, the influencer was seen hugging and kissing a shirtless man on her bed, who fans believed was Berrios. However, Alix took to the comments section at the time to address the speculation, writing, ""We're not even ‘dating' but just hard for me to not share stuff w u guys hahahaha.""
In a previous TikTok, the 22-year-old referenced the athlete, 27, during a Get Ready With Me video, explaining to her followers, ""I'm staying here with a guy this weekend.""
She continued, ""But, obviously, I have to make my ‘Get Ready With Me' videos, so he's listening to me scream right now. I have to tell you, though, it is so nice not having someone yell at you while making them.""
Prior to her relationship with Braxton, Alix was linked to baseball player Tyler Wade. She confirmed the breakup in December 2022 after three months of dating.
""We have been fighting for a bit,"" the University of Miami graduate shared at the time. ""I just was not happy with the way I was feeling.""
As for Braxton? He dated Sophia Culpo for two years before their breaking up in early 2023.
Last month, the NFL star addressed allegations that he had cheated on the Culpo Sisters star before their split, saying that ""towards the end of it, we had conversations along the lines of we just weren't working out.""
""It had nothing to do with anything else,"" he added. ""It had nothing to do with anybody else for that matter.""

TikTok Sensation Alix Earle and NFL Player Braxton Berrios Confirm Romance at 2023 ESPY Awards

The colors of Alix Earle's ESPY Awards look were a bold statement of her personal style, with a strapless leather dress that was both feminine and edgy. The TikTok starlet, who has been making waves with her romantic getaways and loved-up clips, walked the red carpet hand-in-hand with her beau, Miami Dolphins wide receiver Braxton Berrios.

Earle's look was a masterclass in understated glamour, with her hair styled in a half-up, half-down 'do and her glossy lips and dramatic smokey eye making a bold statement. The outfit was topped off with a statement earring and Steve Madden heels, adding a touch of sophistication to the overall look.

Berrios, meanwhile, opted for a classic light pink suit that was reminiscent of the Barbie-inspired fashion trend. The look was a nod to the classic menswear styles, but with a bold twist that added a touch of whimsy to the overall look.

Before the ceremony, Earle took to TikTok to give her fans a behind-the-scenes look at her getting ready routine, including her glam session, hair styling, and a final reveal of her outfit. ""Just going today as a plus-one,"" she captioned the post, with a winking face emoji that hinted at her date.

The ESPY Awards marks one of the first public appearances of the couple, who have been rumored to be dating for over a month. Fans have been speculating about their relationship status, with Earle's TikTok feed featuring increasingly loved-up clips.

However, the road to the ESPY Awards has not been without its drama. Berrios was previously linked to Sofia Culpo, star of TLC's The Culpo Sisters, and the two had a very public breakup. When rumors of Earle and Berrios' relationship began to circulate, Culpo took to TikTok to shade her ex, posting a cryptic message that read, ""Give it a few, but call me when the love bombing ends.""

Despite the drama, Earle and Berrios seem to be going strong, with the TikTok starlet gushing about her date on social media. As they make their way into the spotlight, fans can't help but wonder what's next for the couple.","Here is a rewritten version of the source document in the style of Eonline:

Earle topped off her look with a statement earring and Steve Madden heels.

**The Couple's Relationship Timeline**

Although Earle and Berrios have been open about their relationship on social media, the ESPY Awards marked one of their first public appearances together. Fans have been speculating about their romance since June, when Earle posted a TikTok video of the couple cooking and enjoying a romantic date night in Miami.

**Drama with Ex Sofia Culpo**

Before Earle, Berrios dated Sofia Culpo, star of TLC's The Culpo Sisters.

However, Culpo later deleted the post and downplayed the drama, saying ""It really wasn't that deep.""

**Berrios Weighs in on the Drama**

Get Ready for the Ultimate Power Couple: Alix Earle and Braxton Berrios Confirm Their Relationship at the 2023 ESPY Awards!

After weeks of speculation, TikTok sensation Alix Earle and football player Braxton Berrios have finally confirmed their romance, and we couldn't be more thrilled! The duo made their red carpet debut at the 2023 ESPY Awards, honoring greatness in athletic achievement, and they absolutely slayed the game.

Alix stunned in a strapless leather dress that was equal parts feminine and edgy, paired with her signature glossy lips and dramatic smokey eye. She finished off the look with a statement earring and Steve Madden heels, proving that sometimes less is more. Meanwhile, Braxton looked dapper in a classic light pink suit that was reminiscent of the Barbie-mania trend.

But before they made their grand entrance, Alix gave her fans a sneak peek into her getting-ready process on TikTok. From her initial glam session to her hair styling and final outfit reveal, Alix took her followers on a journey, and we were hooked!

""Just going as a plus-one today,"" Alix teased in a TikTok video before the ceremony. ""You guys can probably guess who I'm going with."" And guess we did, because the chemistry between these two is undeniable!

While Alix and Braxton's relationship has been an open secret for the past month, the ESPY Awards marked one of the first times they've publicly appeared together. Fans have been suspecting a romance from Alix's TikTok feed, which has been filled with loved-up clips.

Back in June, the couple posted a romantic date night video on Alix's page, featuring them cooking and enjoying a cozy evening together on a balcony overlooking Miami's Biscayne Bay at sunset. Swoon!

However, it hasn't been all smooth sailing for the couple. Before Alix, Braxton dated Sofia Culpo, star of TLC's The Culpo Sisters. When rumors of Alix and Braxton's relationship started circulating, Culpo took to TikTok to throw some shade.

""Give it a few, but call me when the love bombing ends,"" Culpo captioned her post, using the hashtags #girltok and #narcredflag. She later deleted the post and shared a TikTok story detailing her reaction. ""I'm sorry the internet has their panties in a wad. It wasn't that deep,"" she said. ""I'm good. I'm good. The internet is wild, but we're good.""

Despite Culpo's claims, Braxton still felt the need to comment on the situation. ""I genuinely want all of this to be over and everybody to move on and do whatever makes them happy,"" he wrote on his Instagram Story. ""I was in a relationship for two years. It was a good relationship. It was a healthy one. And towards the end of it, we had conversations along the lines of we just weren't working out.""

Well, it's clear that Braxton has moved on and found happiness with Alix. We can't wait to see what the future holds for this power couple!"

1.0,"It feels wrong to say I’ve missed Captain Black Jack Randall. After all, he’s a despicable sadist who’s only brought pain and suffering into our heroes’ lives. But his appearance (or “resurrection,” as it were) at the French court put into stark relief just how insufficient the Comte St. Germain is as a villainous foil — he’s mostly just a stuck-up rich guy; the French equivalent of James Spader in a John Hughes movie. Plus, Tobias Menzies is just so damn fun to watch. So forgive me for saying, “Welcome Back, Jack.” But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s start at the beginning.
We pick up in the aftermath of last episode’s brawl, with Claire waiting for Jamie to return home after being arrested as part of the melee. The manner in which this portion of the Dragonfly in Amber source material manifested on-screen was a little curious to me. Producers have condensed time periods and narratives throughout this season (wisely in most cases), but this moment felt like it could have benefited from expansion. Where’s the tension and worry waiting for Jamie to be released? Given his past brushes with the law, it seems a missed opportunity to have him carted off and returned — thanks to a vouch from Duverney — in the span of, like, one minute of the show’s narrative.
After relaying the events of his release, Jamie explains to Claire how she earned those “La Dame Blanche” exclamations. You see, Jamie had spread the rumor that she was the mythological figure in order to explain why he wouldn’t indulge in prostitutes at Maison Elise. Claire’s initially angry, but the admission sparks a realization — it’s very likely the men who attacked Claire and Mary Hawkins frequent the whorehouse since they knew about this bit of gossip. And if Claire and Jamie can figure out their identities, perhaps they will lead them back to St. Germain. Murtagh later adds another clue to the investigation: The men are part of an aristocratic society that requires a maidenhead for entry. Yuck.
Claire pays a visit to Mary under the guise of giving her a medical exam. Mary says she hasn’t been allowed to go outside since the attack and is supposed to leave Paris as soon as she’s recovered. While grounded (because that’s what she is, really), Mary pens a letter to the Bastille, advocating for Alex’s release. She asks Claire to deliver it for her, and then wonders aloud if she might be pregnant. Claire doesn’t think so considering the rapist wasn’t able to, uh, finish. Another silver lining: Mary won’t have to marry the viscount now. Mary now has visions of marrying Alex, which won’t be happening either. Claire, knowing she has to protect the Jonathan Randall-Mary Hawkins ancestral line if Frank is ever to be born, convinces Alex that he is in too ill of health to take Mary as his bride: He’d only be a burden.
Meanwhile, Jamie is being educated on the latest step in Bonnie Prince Charlie’s grand scheme: The exiled monarch is about to come into 10,000 pounds sterling. How, you may be wondering? Well, Charles is getting in bed with the Comte. (Metaphorically, of course.) St. Germain wants to purchase a shipment of wine, but he needs a business partner to do so. Apparently, Charles has somehow secured a bank loan and will happily enter into an agreement to sell the wine for a profit. Jamie points out that the sum isn’t enough to mount a war, but Charles assures that it’ll at least be enough to secure a ship, arms, and fighting men. And Jamie’s involvement? Well, as you might have guessed, Charles wants him to be the wine merchant.
Following the prince’s wishes, Jamie takes a meeting with the Comte at Maison Elise to hash out their agreement. The meeting is obviously tense, with neither party willing to set aside his ego for even a minute. St. Germain demands that the wine remain in his possession until Jamie presents buyers. Jamie agrees. And this particular plan of action presents an opportunity: If Claire can secure an herb that mimics the symptoms of small pox, they may be able to doom the entire shipment, and by extension, Bonnie Prince Charlie’s profit.
And now, dear readers, we’ve arrived at that most chilling of moments: When, while walking the grounds of Versailles, Claire comes face-to-face with her greatest adversary, Black Jack Randall. He’s come to France to help his ailing brother. And it’s all Claire can do to remain composed. Her strolling companion Annalise asks if Claire needs Jamie, and the mere reference to the Scot sends Black Jack into barely-contained ecstasy.
“Jamie? He’s here? Where?” he asks in little more than a whisper.
It all finally becomes too much for Claire, and she excuses herself with Jamie following close behind. But he halts, and before Claire can stop him, returns to face Black Jack. In a moment the audience can’t hear, Jamie challenges him to a duel. (Which, you’ll recall, is illegal in France.) Claire has other plans, though, and runs to the Bastille to falsely accuse Black Jack of the attack on her and Mary. She knows he won’t stay in jail for long but needs the time to convince Jamie that his plan is all kinds of wrong. Jamie, in turn, is furious. How dare Claire deprive him of his vengeance! It’s then that Claire reveals her motivation: protecting Frank’s fate. She begs for just a year reprieve, and then she’ll help bleed Randall herself. Kissing his sword, Jamie finally concedes: One year.","“Untimely Resurrections” picks up where the previous episode left off, with servants cleaning up from the wreckage of the Frasers’ epic dinner party. As you may recall, that party ended in a brawl after guests jumped to the conclusion that Alex Randall, secretary to the duke and brother to super-villain Captain Jack Randall, had assaulted poor little Mary Hawkins. The pugilists were dragged off by the gendarme, and affable nincompoop Prince Charles left with the sinister Comte St. Germain, no doubt to have some poison poured into his ear.
Jamie, sprung from prison by one of his aristocratic friends and now home with an exhausted Claire, wants to know how Claire and Co. managed to escape their assailants in the alley. Claire isn’t sure; she was perhaps mistaken for a mythical creature called “La Dame Blanche?” A shifty-looking Jamie confesses: Turns out he started the rumor that his wife is the powerful “White Woman” to explain why he didn’t want to cheat on her. Claire is dismayed (remember what happened when people assumed she was a witch back in Cranesmuir?) but also kind of amused, and maybe even a little turned on.
Later, she calls on Mary in a smashing ensemble the color of Mary’s still-livid bruise, and offers medicinal herbs and reassurance. No, the poor girl does not need to worry about getting pregnant from the assault, since her attacker didn’t “finish.” Mary doesn’t quite know what this means but you can see that she’s relieved enough that she doesn’t care. She may not understand sex, but now that it’s been forced on her, she does know a few things: Her engagement is canceled, she’s under house arrest, and she’s supposed to feel ashamed.
Even though we understand why Claire is meddling (to protect Future Frank), it’s hard not to be disgusted when Mary’s been hurt so much already. To her credit, Claire seems disgusted with herself. What she needs is a snapshot of herself and Frank from the 20th century, à la the McFly family photo in Back to the Future, so that she can gauge if Frank is in real danger by shifting timelines. Without that, she can only guess whether she’s helping or hurting his chances for survival.
Jamie, meanwhile, is doing his part to help the future by listening to Prince Charles ramble about how great things are going. Charles is totally over Louise, his married lover who now plans to raise their baby with her husband. And he’s over his old investors, too — they have proven themselves unworthy. Presumably they were turned off by his behavior at the Frasers’ dinner party, just as Jamie and Claire had hoped they would be. He says he has a new investor now: St. Germain.
Charles would like Jamie to work with and “keep a wary eye” on the comte, because, appearances to the contrary, he’s not a fool — he knows St. Germain has a bad reputation. Come on, your highness! St. Germain is such a Slytherin, I wouldn’t be surprised if he had two house elves and a pet python. Jamie tries to make this point, alluding to St. German’s affiliation with the dark arts, but the prince dismisses these rumors, pointing out that he’s heard Jamie’s own wife is a witch. True, but she’s a Gryffindor!
Jamie’s meeting with the comte, which takes place at Charlie’s insistence, only serves to underline that these men can despise each other fluently in two languages. Nonetheless, they will work together. Or will they? Maybe Claire can somehow make it seem as though St. Germain’s shipment of Portuguese wine is polluted by smallpox and have it destroyed, like his cargo from the season premiere.
Next up: Jamie needs to see a man about a horse, which somehow means everyone is at Versailles dressed up like it’s Oscars night. Claire once again matches the scenery in a floral brown-and-yellow number that’s ravishing even by her standards; the skirt is so wide that, when frenemy Annalise asks to take a walk with her, they must proceed single-file through a gate. Is this like Mad Men now? Is Claire’s costuming meant to connect her to this time and place, even though both are foreign to her? She does seem more comfortable in pre-Revolutionary Paris than one might expect.
Jamie, who seems less comfortable (he’s still, for example, wearing his kilt), helps the duke consider his options: This filly or that stallion. The duke seems more interested in why Jamie, who is such a good judge of horses, is such a bad judge of men. The duke is not impressed by Bonnie Prince Charlie and he wants to understand why Jamie is — or pretends to be.
Speaking of men, Annalise asks Claire, who’s that one over there staring at you? Why, he’s none other than England’s most frightening redcoat, Captain Randall. When last they met, Randall was playing a vicious game of fuck, marry, kill with Jamie, but Claire orchestrated Jamie’s rescue before the activities could conclude.
Claire, who wasn’t feeling quite steady to begin with, now looks like she might pass out. Annalise goes to get Jamie, which is the worst possible thing she could do, since Jamie wants nothing more than to kill Randall — and drawing a sword in Versailles is a capital offense. Randall seems to savor the crazy coincidence, or, as he calls it, “the sublime preposterousness of a universe that would guide us to a meeting.” Perhaps he really does have a death wish. In any event, he needs to know how a confrontation with Jamie here, in the French court, would play out.
Randall grabs Claire’s arm to keep her from running to Jamie, warning her, “The king …” In high dudgeon, Claire retorts, “Fuck the king.” The line shouldn’t work, but the way Caitriona Balfe delivers it, it does. She and Tobias Menzies crackle together; the scene is so tense as to be almost unbearable. And just as surely as we knew last episode that heads would roll before the dinner party was over, we know now that there will be blood on the French grass soon enough.
Randall releases Claire, bowing low, and Claire whirls around to see King Louis himself. The sovereign, the soldier, and Claire make small talk about war and politics and the trickiness of the French accent. Claire is distracted, wondering where Jamie is and what he’ll do when he spots his archenemy. She needn’t have worried. Jamie, once he arrives, is master of himself, managing to be at least as civil with Randall as he was earlier with St. Germain. And yet the tension does not abate. Randall is here to plead with the duke for his brother. The king (played by Lionel Lingelser, who relishes the role of fey monarch in much the way Jonathan Groff did in Hamilton) tricks Randall into getting down on one knee and then laughs at him.
Claire and Jamie escape, but just when Claire thinks she’s safe, Jamie makes sure she’s feeling sufficiently well and turns back to challenge Randall to a duel. Randall accepts, of course. (“He owes me a death.”) Jamie’s got a spring in his step and the light of revenge in his eye. Claire, by contrast, heads straight to the Bastille to get Randall locked up — just long enough, hopefully, to get Jamie to listen to reason.
At last Claire flings her last argument at Jamie: If he kills Randall, it will be like he’s killing Frank, since Frank will never be born. One year: Randall just needs one year to marry and have a child with Mary Hawkins. Can Jamie spare his nemesis that long? There’s no point trying to get between a Scotsman and his vengeance. Jamie won’t budge. Killing Randall is too important.
In the end, the winning argument comes down to honor. Claire has saved Jamie’s life and so, as much as she hates it, she must beg for Randall’s life in return, at least until after Frank’s ancestor is born. At last, Jamie relents. But it’s clear from his face, and from the feeling in the room, that this isn’t over.",Ew,Vulture,"Here is the rewritten document:

Dear Outlander fans,

I must admit, I've missed Captain Black Jack Randall. His return to the French court highlighted the Comte St. Germain's inadequacy as a villainous foil. Tobias Menzies is a delight to watch, so forgive me for saying, ""Welcome Back, Jack.""

Claire agrees, and Mary wonders aloud if she might be pregnant. Claire reassures her that's unlikely, given the circumstances. Mary now has visions of marrying Alex, but Claire must convince her otherwise to protect the Jonathan Randall-Mary Hawkins ancestral line.

It's hard to admit, but I've missed Captain Black Jack Randall, the despicable sadist who's brought nothing but pain and suffering into our heroes' lives.

Claire has other plans, though, and runs to the Bastille to falsely accuse Black Jack of the attack on her and Mary.

It's then that Claire reveals her motivation: protecting Frank's fate. She begs for just a year's reprieve, and then she'll help bleed Randall herself. Kissing his sword, Jamie finally concedes: One year.","Here is the rewritten source document in the style of the reference document from Vulture:

**Welcome Back, Jack**

It's hard to admit, but I've missed Captain Black Jack Randall. Yes, he's a despicable sadist who's brought nothing but pain and suffering to our heroes' lives. But his sudden appearance at the French court highlighted just how lacking the Comte St. Germain is as a villainous foil. He's just a rich, stuck-up guy – the French equivalent of James Spader in a John Hughes movie. And let's be real, Tobias Menzies is just so damn fun to watch. So, forgive me for saying, ""Welcome Back, Jack."" But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start at the beginning.

We pick up where we left off, with Claire waiting for Jamie to return home after being arrested in the melee. The way this part of the Dragonfly in Amber source material played out on-screen was a bit curious to me. The producers have condensed time periods and narratives throughout this season (wisely, in most cases), but this moment felt like it could have benefited from expansion. Where's the tension and worry waiting for Jamie to be released? Given his past brushes with the law, it seems a missed opportunity to have him carted off and returned – thanks to a vouch from Duverney – in the span of, like, one minute of the show's narrative.

After relaying the events of his release, Jamie explains to Claire how she earned those ""La Dame Blanche"" exclamations. You see, Jamie had spread the rumor that she was the mythological figure to explain why he wouldn't indulge in prostitutes at Maison Elise. Claire's initially angry, but the admission sparks a realization – it's very likely the men who attacked Claire and Mary Hawkins frequent the whorehouse since they knew about this bit of gossip. And if Claire and Jamie can figure out their identities, perhaps they will lead them back to St. Germain. Murtagh later adds another clue to the investigation: The men are part of an aristocratic society that requires a maidenhead for entry. Yuck.

Claire pays a visit to Mary under the guise of giving her a medical exam. Mary says she hasn't been allowed to go outside since the attack and is supposed to leave Paris as soon as she's recovered. While grounded (because that's what she is, really), Mary pens a letter to the Bastille, advocating for Alex's release. She asks Claire to deliver it for her, and then wonders aloud if she might be pregnant. Claire doesn't think so, considering the rapist wasn't able to, uh, finish. Another silver lining: Mary won't have to marry the viscount now. Mary now has visions of marrying Alex, which won't be happening either. Claire, knowing she has to protect the Jonathan Randall-Mary Hawkins ancestral line if Frank is ever to be born, convinces Alex that he is in too ill of health to take Mary as his bride: He'd only be a burden.

Meanwhile, Jamie is being educated on the latest step in Bonnie Prince Charlie's grand scheme: The exiled monarch is about to come into 10,000 pounds sterling. How, you may be wondering? Well, Charles is getting in bed with the Comte. (Metaphorically, of course.) St. Germain wants to purchase a shipment of wine, but he needs a business partner to do so. Apparently, Charles has somehow secured a bank loan and will happily enter into an agreement to sell the wine for a profit. Jamie points out that the sum isn't enough to mount a war, but Charles assures that it'll at least be enough to secure a ship, arms, and fighting men. And Jamie's involvement? Well, as you might have guessed, Charles wants him to be the wine merchant.

Following the prince's wishes, Jamie takes a meeting with the Comte at Maison Elise to hash out their agreement. The meeting is obviously tense, with neither party willing to set aside his ego for even a minute. St. Germain demands that the wine remain in his possession until Jamie presents buyers. Jamie agrees. And this particular plan of action presents an opportunity: If Claire can secure an herb that mimics the symptoms of smallpox, they may be able to doom the entire shipment, and by extension, Bonnie Prince Charlie's profit.

And now, dear readers, we've arrived at that most chilling of moments: When, while walking the grounds of Versailles, Claire comes face-to-face with her greatest adversary, Black Jack Randall. He's come to France to help his ailing brother. And it's all Claire can do to remain composed. Her strolling companion Annalise asks if Claire needs Jamie, and the mere reference to the Scot sends Black Jack into barely-contained ecstasy.

""Jamie? He's here? Where?"" he asks in little more than a whisper.

It all finally becomes too much for Claire, and she excuses herself with Jamie following close behind. But he halts, and before Claire can stop him, returns to face Black Jack. In a moment the audience can't hear, Jamie challenges him to a duel. (Which, you'll recall, is illegal in France.)

What's the deal with Sesame Street's Glee parody? 

Better Call Saul fans have been worried about Sesame Street for a while now. The popular children's show, which married Jimmy McGill (the guy who's basically the human version of a dumpster fire), has been teaching kids about the importance of the alphabet, and it's about time someone did a spot-on spoof of Glee. 

In this week's episode, Sesame Street tackles the grooviest letter of them all: ""G"". The ultracompetent Muppets who made this parody possible never appeared in the original Glee, which led some viewers to assume they would die before the episode finished. 

But, in a shocking twist, the Muppets not only survived but also managed to out-Glee Glee. Which one-liner got you? (""I wasn't asking you Gooster, I was asking the funny-shaped kid!"") Do you prefer Muppet Kurt to actual Glee Kurt? Share in the comments section below!

Sesame Street Gleefully Trolls Glee in Groovy Parody

Leave it to Sesame Street to school us on the letter ""G"", all while delivering a spot-on spoof of Glee that will have you giggling like a Muppet. In a hilarious parody that's equal parts nostalgic and silly, the beloved children's show takes on the musical TV series with a funky fresh twist.

From the opening notes of ""Gee, I Want to Be a Glee Clubber"", you'll be hooked. The Sesame Street gang – including a pitch-perfect puppet Kurt – brings their A-game, serving up a sidesplitting send-up of Glee's iconic cheerleading squad, New Directions. Who knew Elmo could rock a Cheerios-inspired costume like it's nobody's business?

But the real pièce de résistance is the on-point one-liners. ""I wasn't asking you, Gooster, I was asking the funny-shaped kid!"" had us LOL-ing so hard we spilled our coffee. Is puppet Kurt more charismatic than actual Glee Kurt? Discuss.

1.0,"Bennett faces an important decision that could affect his—and Daya's—lives while a bed bug infestation sweeps Litchfield..
Look, life isn’t great for the inmates of Litchfield—they have about as little control over their lives as someone could. Sure, it’s possible to become a Vee or a Red, but their lives on the inside remain at the mercy of those running the prison, and on the outside by whoever is willing to keep their memory alive.
Because of those domineering forces, control becomes an ever more important aspect of their lives. No matter how big or small, control over anything can give their lives meaning. Episode 2 is an exercise in how fickle control is—it can be grasped as easily as it can be snatched away.
There’s a prison-wide loss of control when an infestation of bed bugs hits Litchfield, forcing all of the women into paper jumpsuits, or underwear when they run out of the wafer thin outfits, while their clothes are cleaned (and recleaned).
A more individual loss of control also begins to show itself from the episode’s start. Red thought her life on the outside was in a good place, but as she learned in the last episode, something went awry with her shop. And as she confronts Piper, she learns the truth—the “thriving” market Piper detailed was in fact shut down. Piper tries to explain herself, she only wanted to make Red happy, but the delayed revelation has only infuriated her more.
But it’s not just the inmates who are losing control of their relationships. Bennett may assume all is well with his and Daya’s baby, but when he discovers Pornstache’s mother (played by Mary Steenburgen) is visiting Aleida after the latter stole the letters Pornstache’s mom sent Daya and wrote back).
The talk goes well for Aleida, who essentially blackmails the fake soon-to-be grandmother with the possibility of taking care of Daya’s daughter. The two agree that, in exchange for money every month for both Aleida and Daya, she can take care of the child and hopefully do a better job of raising it than she did bringing up someone who could be named Pornstache.
Bennett is furious, but when Aleida explains the situation to him and Daya, the actual mother is not so against the idea. It’ll at least give the baby a proper home, because, as Bennett soon finds out, living with Aleida’s lover Cesar isn’t an ideal situation.
Bennett in fact is the episode’s flashback subject, reflecting on his time in the service. He may be the prettiest soldier his new sargeant has ever seen, but he’s also there to put in as much work is necessary… even if work means lip-syncing while shirtless along to the Gwen Stefani classic “Hollaback Girl” for a viral video.
For Bennett’s camp, war involves little actual warring. Instead his platoon trains local soldiers (who are less than enthused about the lip-syncing), watches as drones take out enemy camps, and seeing little real action.
His base turns from safe space to chaotic war zone when the local guards throw a grenade into one of their tents. The lone local guard who tries to help is gunned down for shouting “bomb.” The flashback ends with Bennett cowering, waiting for the explosion while another soldier hops on top of the grenade to shield his brothers.
And while Bennett may have not lost a part of himself in the service, he did go on to lose his leg, and he isn’t about to lose his unborn child. He wants to prove to Daya he’s in this for long haul, and so he proposes to her (with a ring fashioned out of gum wrappers). She says yes, and Bennett quickly gets a Diaz family education, visiting Cesar and the large number of children he’s caring for from Daya’s family.
To be blunt, as Bennett seems to see it, those kids would be better off without the gun-toting father figure who’s live-in “side thing” is taking care of children she has little relation to. He seems to care about protecting them, or he wouldn’t be doing so, but his regard for their well-being is shown in dangerous ways, and Bennett is wary about following in those steps. But where exactly Bennett is going to go remains a mystery, as he leaves the crib he was gifted by Cesar on the side of the road and speeds off in a fit of anger.
NEXT: Litchfield’s days may be numbered.
Frustration is pervasive among those back at Litchfield, who are now without comfortable clothes (burned), mattresses (also burned), and books (almost saved but most definitely burned). And there’s little chance of those supplies being replenished because… oh, didn’t Caputo hear? Well… Litchfield is closing.
Yes, the inmates are set to be shipped out by the 20th (presumably of May but no month is given) and the prison closed by the 30th. Caputo may still be transferred since he’s looked at favorably, but the remaining staff are likely to lose their jobs.The revelation shatters Caputo’s state of mind, leaving him hollow as the book burning he was so ardently against commences.
He tells no one, instead letting the inmates and employees go on with their lives. So Luschek decides to help Nicky sell the heroin, and Piper confronts her habit of lying and reveals to Alex that she was the one who ratted her out to her parole officer. The former situation falls apart when Nicky goes to recover the heroin, and finds it gone.
The latter sees a much more explosive resolution. Piper lays the truth out on the table, just as Alex suggested she should have done with Red, but her plan backfires. Alex calls her a manipulative c–t, wanting to maintain the power in her relationships at any cost.
And it’s true. Piper’s fear of losing control, losing the safety net of her life, has been a defining characteristic since her first day in Litchfield. At times, it has worked, but more often than not her scheming, intentional or subconscious, comes back to bite her, as it does with Alex.
Until the two start having angry sex in the library, of course. She acted as she did to have Alex back in her life, and she has her back, physically if not emotionally.
Piper and Alex hooking up at the end of the episode is just another shift in their power dynamic. Alex is taking control after Piper took it away from her. She’s still in jail, she’s still lost her life on the outside, and she may be in more danger now than ever, but at least she can control something. And being able to control their decisions about anything is what just about everyone, from Caputo to Red to Nicky to Bennett, so desperately wants.
Correction: An earlier version of this recap indicated Bennett lost his leg in the war, which was in fact not the case as it had previously been revealed he had lost it due to a hot tub.","Have any of you ever had bedbugs? It is one of the worst experiences I have had in my adult life along with wisdom teeth removal, grundle waxing, and attending a booze cruise with a University of Tennessee alumni association. It is the absolute worst thing, and it takes months of living with your stuff in plastic bags, disinfecting, treating your clothes and furniture and mattress and the whole time imagining your blood is being sucked out by tiny meanies that get you in your sleep. On the upside, they send a cute beagle to your house to make sure the infestation is gone, but that is an Instagram picture that you pay for dearly.
I totally sympathized when Flaca thought she had crabs on her arm and discovered that she had bedbugs, which caused the whole prison to have to disinfect, burning the mattresses, books, uniforms, and just about everything other than maxi pads and the fan that they turned into a windmill for the Mother’s Day miniature golf course.
It seems like there is a different structure for most of the episodes this season. Last episode featured the Mother’s Day event, around which all the stories hung. This time it’s the bedbugs, and the main stories are infused with comical moments about this central trope. We saw this a few times last season (like the hurricane episode), but last year the season was organized around Vee and her introduction into the prison ecosystem. That was a nice way of giving structure to a show with a cast so large and sprawling, it could easily fall into disarray. I’m worried that is what is happening here without a central focus to draw everything else in.
That is especially true because the stories we had to focus on are the same, tired old stories that we’ve been dealing with since episode one: Piper being an awful manipulative person, Piper and Alex’s love affair, Daya and Bennett’s relationship, and Red dealing with her family either inside the prison or outside of it. Snooze.
Still, this episode contained plenty of sparks. The scene where the women in the “barrio” find out about the bugs was hilarious. The same goes for Black Cindy washing her “tits, pits, and naughty bits” with disinfectant and saying it was her grandmother’s birth control. The best of all was Taystee trying to convince Caputo and the exterminator that a bug in a book was really a muffin crumb. Who would be reading that book and eating a muffin at the same time? Who would be eating a muffin? Did the Muffin Fairy show up on every other Sunday or something? But Taystee went so far as to eat that bug/muffin crumb to save her beloved library.
That was all for naught because Caputo learns that in two months the prison is going to be closed. Maybe that is what is going to draw this season together? I thought, Oh, the ladies will save the prison so that they can all stay together, like this is The Brady Bunch and they’re going to start a bake sale to save their class turtle or something. This is not that show. These women have no power whatsoever. If the state decides the prison closes, then it closes. Period. They’re shipped off to who knows where and the next season is called Beige Is the New Purple, it is written by Ryan Murphy, and there is a serial killer with a clown face (also played by Lea Delaria) on the loose in the clink.
There were a couple of new stories, like Nicki and Boo’s attempt to get Luschek to smuggle their drugs out of the prison after they find out he’s a weed smoker who brings his stash with him to work every day. Also, Poussey is becoming obsessed with the Santaria in the kitchen, which I find odd and out of character for her, but I’m curious where it is going. I give it two more episodes, tops.
The Alex and Piper thing was a total snore. Alex is super pissed because she is back in jail. It seems that the only thing worse than being in prison is being back in prison. When debating the lie Piper told Red — that her store was still open — Alex says that getting all their shit out on the table and still liking each other was better than being blissfully ignorant. That’s when Piper, with a single tear and a million eye rolls, told Alex that she is the one who ratted her out to get her back in jail. Seriously, we got rid of this story in two episodes? Could it been dragged out a little longer to give it some real tension?
Alex finally realizes what we did halfway through season one and tells Piper she is a, and I quote, “manipulative cunt.” After talking to Red some more, who is still pissed, Piper says that she lies and she gets in trouble and she tells the truth and gets in trouble. That’s because she only ever tells the truth after she has lied about something. If you break the copy machine and tell the boss that it is broken, he won’t care too much, but if you blame it on Susan in accounting and your boss finds out later it was you, then your ass is gonna get fired. Piper comes to the realization that she is manipulative in just the same way that her mother was and is determined that she’s not going to do it anymore. Somehow this leads to her and Alex fighting and fucking on a table in the library. Ugh, I feel like this is all these two ever do. Break the cycle!
Daya and Bennett’s story was a bit more interesting. Aleida met with Pornstache’s mother (Mary Steenburgen, always a pleasure to see her on our TV screen or laptop or phone or wherever the hell you watch this) and shakes her down for money. Ms. Stache says that she wants to adopt the baby and give her all the privilege that a rich white lady in Greenwich can give her, like money, her own bedroom, and clean towels. Bennett wants to take care of the baby himself, because he and Daya are happy and don’t need clean towels. Oh, poor, sweet Bennett. As Cher said, your love can’t pay the rent.
Naturally, Bennett goes to visit Hector, Aleida’s boyfriend who is raising their children and finds what a house full of kids without enough money is like. It’s mostly screaming, toddlers zooming around on a scooter, and a kid getting a gun pulled on him because he doesn’t want to eat French fries that came out of the microwave. (I don’t blame him. Gross French fries are even worse than no French fries at all.) Hector insists on giving Bennett Daya’s old crib so he can raise his own daughter in it, but after the traumatic visit Bennett leaves it on the side of the road.
Bennett, as it turns out, is a coward. We find out through his backstory that the way he lost his leg wasn’t valiantly in battle, but from a grenade an Iraqi soldier threw in his tent that he could have kicked out and saved everyone, but instead he jumped on the ground and another soldier lost his life to protect the platoon. I think it was good to learn this about Bennett, but I was a little disappointed that this was one of the guard’s backstories, and the guard was a man. We are told enough stories about men all over the television (and movies and podcasts and comic books and everything else). The great thing about OITNB is that it always tells the stories of women and many of them disenfranchised. This is one of the few places we can get those. If we want to learn more about straight, white, male Bennett, we can watch How to Get Away with Murder.
The worst thing about this whole story, though, was Daya. Does she not have any agency at all in her own pregnancy? Sure, the inmates are entirely powerless, but she doesn’t seem to care very much about what is happening to her. Both Aleida and Bennett are trying to figure out what should happen to her baby, and she’s just walking around like a sulking somnambulist who took too many Xanax. Get it together, girl, and show some pluck or your baby is going to get taken away.
Here’s looking forward to the next episode, where things will hopefully come together and we’ll get some developments about something other than these tired romantic pairings. And hopefully the bugs will be gone.",Ew,Vulture,"Here is the rewritten document:

Episode 2 of Orange is the New Black is a thought-provoking exploration of the fragile nature of control in the lives of Litchfield's inmates. Bennett, an important figure in Daya's life, faces a critical decision that could have far-reaching consequences for both of them. Meanwhile, a bed bug infestation sweeps through the prison, forcing the women into uncomfortable paper jumpsuits and underwear.

The inmates, trapped in a system where they wield little power, cling to any semblance of control they can grasp. No matter how small, control brings meaning to their lives. This episode masterfully illustrates how fleeting control can be - it can be snatched away at any moment.

Red, a powerful figure within the prison walls, discovers her life outside is not as rosy as she thought. Her shop has been shut down, a revelation that only adds fuel to her anger. Piper's attempts to explain herself fall on deaf ears, and Red's fury intensifies.

Bennett, a character with a tumultuous past, is shown to be struggling with his own sense of control. A flashback sequence reveals his time in the service, where he was forced to confront the harsh realities of war. Despite his best efforts to maintain a sense of control, his new reality is marred by chaos and unpredictability.

The heart of the episode lies in the complex web of relationships within the prison. Bennett's decision may have a profound impact on Daya's life, while Piper's machinations have already caused significant damage to her relationships. As the inmates grapple with the consequences of their actions, it becomes clear that control is a precarious thing.

The episode's climax, which sees Litchfield's very existence threatened, serves as a stark reminder of the inmates' vulnerability. In a world where control is a luxury they can ill afford, they must fight to maintain their dignity and sense of self.

In the end, Episode 2 of Orange is the New Black raises more questions than it answers. Can love and relationships be a source of strength in a place like Litchfield? Or are they doomed to bedestroyed by the very institution that holds them captive?","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Vulture:

Bennett Faces a Crucial Decision in Episode 2 of OITNB

In Litchfield, the inmates have about as much control over their lives as a hot tub has over Bennett's leg (which, by the way, wasn't lost in the war). Sure, they can become a Vee or a Red, but their lives on the inside remain at the mercy of those running the prison, and on the outside by whoever is willing to keep their memory alive.

Control becomes an essential aspect of their lives – no matter how big or small, it gives their lives meaning. Episode 2 is an exercise in how fickle control is – it can be grasped as easily as it can be snatched away.

Last night's episode of Orange is the New Black was a wild ride, folks. It's like, life in Litchfield isn't exactly a walk in the park, but the inmates are about to lose what little control they have over their lives. And let's be real, control is everything when you're stuck behind bars.

The episode kicks off with a bed bug infestation that's got everyone freaking out. Like, the women are forced to wear paper jumpsuits and underwear because their clothes are being cleaned (and recleaned, because, ew). It's a total loss of control, and it's not just the inmates who are affected. Red thought she had her life together on the outside, but it turns out her shop is in trouble. And Piper, oh Piper, she's still trying to make amends with Red, but it's not going so well.

Meanwhile, Bennett is dealing with his own control issues. He's got a baby on the way with Daya, but things get complicated when Pornstache's mom comes to visit Aleida. Like, Aleida is basically blackmailing the woman, saying she'll take care of the baby in exchange for cash. Bennett is furious, but Daya is surprisingly chill about the whole thing. Maybe it's because she's got her own control issues, like living with Aleida's lover Cesar, who's not exactly the most ideal caregiver.

Bennett's flashback is all about his time in the service, where he's more concerned with lip-syncing to ""Hollaback Girl"" than actual warfare. But things take a dark turn when a grenade is thrown into their tent, and Bennett is left cowering in fear. It's a total loss of control, and it's clear that Bennett is still dealing with the aftermath.

Back in the present, Bennett proposes to Daya with a ring made out of gum wrappers (aww), and she says yes. But things get complicated when Bennett meets Cesar and his crew of kids. Like, Bennett is all about protecting the kids, but he's also wary of following in Cesar's footsteps. And let's be real, who can blame him?

Meanwhile, back at Litchfield, the inmates are dealing with their own control issues. Like, the prison is closing, and everyone's freaking out. Caputo's all hollow-eyed and sad, and the inmates are just trying to make the best of it. But things get real when Piper confronts Alex about her lying, and Alex calls her out for being a manipulative control freak. It's a total power play, and Piper's not having it.

The episode ends with Piper and Alex hooking up in the library, because why not? It's all about control, people. And in the world of Litchfield, control is everything.

Chrissy’s father Ron Teigen Sr. filed for divorce from the star’s mother Vilailuck “Pepper” Teigen in Los Angeles on Tuesday, PEOPLE confirms.
The estranged pair share two adult children, Chrissy, 33, and another daughter named Tina.
Chrissy has yet to speak out publicly regarding her parents’ split and a rep for the Bring the Funny star did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.
The reason for their split remains unclear at this time.
In October of last year, Chrissy opened up to PEOPLE about her parents’ relationship, explaining that her mom lives with her and husband John Legend.
“Mom is over so much that she lives with us basically and they’ve had this kind of relationship for a long time. And my dad comes to the house every other day or so, he was just over yesterday,” she said.
The bond Chrissy shares with her parents is evident as Vilailuck constantly appears on the star’s Instagram doting on and cooking for Legend and their two children Luna Simone, 3, and Miles Theodore, 1. She even travels with them too!
In September, Vilailuck, who officially became a U.S. citizen in 2018, jetted off to Thailand (her home country) with Chrissy, Legend, 40, and their kids.
Chrissy often documents their heartwarming and hilarious mother-daughter-moments, including a time the pair worked out while drinking rosé.
In July, Chrissy and Vilailuck hit up her home gym (which she admitted was rare) and the pair said they’re getting ready for the fall season.

The cookbook author added that her parents' living arrangement simply worked for them.
""It just works for them,"" she said at the time. ""It's a good family life. We're all very close, very tight–knit.""
Chrissy's mom also regularly makes appearances on her social media pages. Moreover, Pepper regularly accompanies her daughter to major events and spends quality time with her grand-kids, Luna and Miles.
Just last month, both the supermodel and her husband, John, opened up about their family life to Vanity Fair. ""I hate pretending that we do it on our own,"" she said after her nanny put her baby boy down for a nap. ""We have daytime help, nighttime, weekend. I don't know how my mom did it.""

1.0,"""I was not caught, though many tried. I live among you, well-disguised.""
It's interesting to note that True Detective Season 1 utilized The Handsome Family's haunted ballad ""Far From Any Road,"" and despite the grisly imagery of the lyrics, there was a swing to the song; you could dance to it, if you had such an inclination. That seemed a fitting reflection of what Season 1 was: a horrific, absorbing police procedural given cinematic visual zest by the distinctly talented Cary Fukunaga and two furiously engaged, thoughtful, and perceptively physical lead performances. In comparison, Season 2 coopts Leonard Cohen's lugubrious ""Nevermind"" as its theme song, which is made up of a string of unsettling pronouncements (""I live among you/well-disguised"") held together by a minimal, percussive beat and some soulful flair by a cadre of back-up singers. And Cohen's song is similarly reflective of the pickled, overtly brooding mood and sluggish tempo of True Detective Season 2, which centers on a quartet of modern-day Californians who are thrown into tumult when a crooked government official is found dead, with his eyes burned out by acid.
The murder, which isn't fully seen until the end of the season premiere, ""The Western Book of the Dead,"" brings together three similarly brooding and wayward cops from separate law enforcement departments. This starts with Ray Velcoro (Colin Farrell), a detective working out of the Vinci district with deep, corrupt connections to both the Mayor's office and to Frank Semyon (Vince Vaughn), a local, brutal gangster trying to go clean with his Lady Macbeth-esque wife (Kelly Reilly). Velcoro's opening salvo includes drunkenly berating his son about the shoes he's wearing and beating up a small-time journalist to protect Semyon, who once helped the detective exact some revenge on his wife's attacker and rapist. Farrell is a strong, imposing performer and he makes an absurdly cynical character halfway believable, despite Nic Pizzolatto's inexplicable self-seriousness design for Velcoro and his attempts at redemption.
This might have been more believable if Rachel McAdams's Ani Bezzerides, Velcoro's impending partner on the case, wasn't also almost laughably overtly hardened. And of course, like Velcoro, part of Bezzerides's design is of an entanglement of sex and vengeance, as she seems to be still working out her youth in the strange cult run by her father (David Morse) through her cold relationship with a colleague. Again, McAdams is a performer of visceral grace and natural charm, but the character she's given feels thin and simplistic, a heroic cynic obsessed with the job and some bleak sense of morality. There's no tang in the environs or the language, just a handsomely lensed melange of the worlds of Chinatown and Michael Mann's Thief. Justin Lin directs the episode with forceful competence, the best example of which is the sequence when Velcoro beats up the journalist, but the problem here is primarily Pizzolatto's characterizations and the jungle of bland sexual hang-ups he's devised here.
There's always a chance that True Detective Season 2 will be a late bloomer but even if this will end up being just an agonizingly slow wind-up to a perfect pitch, the self-satisfied cynicism that plagues ""The Western Book of the Dead"" displays little of the ambition that Season 1 had, which was evident from the series premiere. There's a general watchability to all of this, thanks largely to some seriously impactful editing and smart compositions, but the perspective is simply that everything is the worst. It's main utility is brooding, damaged masculinity, typified by Taylor Kitsch's Paul Woodrugh, the motorcycle cop who needs viagra to have sex with his girlfriend and likes to ride his bike at night along winding mountain roads without his lights on. And yet there's no recognition in the script or in Lin's direction to suggest that either of them understand that they are dealing in archetypes here, a grisly outlook given almost no complexity. ""We get the world that we deserve"" says Velcoro in the trailers for True Detective Season 2, and you can feel that sickened, unconvincing attitude throughout the very first episode.","The HBO crime anthology heads west for a slow start to season 2.
The polarizing sensation that is True Detective is back, whether you want it to be or not. By the end of season 1, viewers were debating the groundbreaking crime anthology’s prestige TV bona fides as much as they were the identity of The Yellow King. Year one of Nic Pizzolatto’s novel franchise blended serial killer mystery with Southern gothic, cosmic horror, and existential pondering. Time is a flat circle. The world needs bad men. We are the stories we tell ourselves. And a lawnmower man runs through it. The follow-up regenerates by trucking West for a sprawling sun-bleached neo-noir about corrupt empire builders, fallen fathers, and despairing dicks of all kinds, set to a sexy-sinister Leonard Cohen tome poem beat. In season 2, I see the structure, tropes, and some of the indulgences of James Ellroy, author of L.A. Confidential (the best known of his “L.A. Quartet” novels) and American Tabloid. We have a three-headed narrative, pocked with vice and steeped in themes of sin, penance, and flailing redemption. This year’s collection of characters and the storytelling don’t capture my imagination the way Rust Cohle, Marty Hart, and the time-toggling, unreliable narrator yarn-spinning did last year. So we hope-watch, to borrow from Alan Sepinwall. May the season catch fire, or I’ll be as sad as Colin Farrell’s droopstache.
Episode 1’s title riffs off The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a tome that charts the experience of the deceased as they progress through the afterlife—the way, say, a certain dead body was chauffeured by an unseen psycho pomp up stygian rivers of freeways to his final destination. Tibetan Buddhism promises—or threatens, depending on your perspective—the prospect of rebirth. This season’s “heroes”—Ray Velcoro (Farrell), Ani Bezzerides (Rachel McAdams), and Paul Woodrugh (Taylor Kitsch)—could certainly use new life. They’re all stuck on wheels of suffering; fixations with past pain, obsessions with worldly desires, so much self-loathing and wrath. Other allusions speak to other kinds of death marches and perilous roads to resurrection. Vince Vaughn’s criminal entrepreneur Frank Semyon—dressing for a date with destiny that has him mad anxious—tells his wife, Jordan: “Behold what was once a man…” The line is a variation on Pilate’s wry observation of Jesus after the scourging and ironic crowning and before the trudge to Golgotha. “Behold the man.”* I suspect True Detective has stages-of-the-cross on the brain: Behold a passion play pulp fiction.
Ecce homo, Ray Velcoro? Talk about scourging. How many miserable cop clichés can a story inflict upon this anti-heroic baddish lieutenant? Velcoro—I hear the rip of Velcro when I see his name—is a boozing, coke-snorting, power-abusing, self-loathing divorce and bad dad. We meet him sending his meek, doughy, son off to school with a brand new pair of sneakers, exhorting him to be the “strong” and “proud” representation of manhood that he himself wishes he could be. Chad ain’t buying what his floppy-haired father is hard-selling. His desperation is as pungent as the whisky rank that must steam from his pores.
Ray watches Chad march his own death march past a schoolyard tough. With his round shape and crimson air, Chad is a walking bullseye, and the punk can’t resist throwing darts. Chad shakes him off. Ray can’t. Bully boy will come to regret picking on Ray’s mini-me.
Ray works the streets of Vinci, a city of industry most foul. The population is so tiny, even the mayor doesn’t even live there. But its significance to SoCal’s economy—and criminality—is huge. It’s a bad bardo of fallen souls and princely demons. Polluting factories, dive bars, dull, beige suburbs, and one bumping casino, Vinci Garden Casino, the throne room of Frank Semyon, a new century gangster with pretensions of legitimacy.
They did. “Talked.” Many times. Now, Frank owns him, maybe because Ray thinks he forever owes him, or maybe whatever he did with the intel Frank gave him left him feeling so damned, he feels he deserves no better than doing this devil’s will. Or maybe it’s too early to draw conclusions about how Ray became what Ray is.* “I welcome judgment,” he tells the Frank-supplied lawyer trying to help him win custody of his son. Spoken like a blameless man who has no shame, or a man mad from guilt who wants to be put down like a rabid dog.
*Ray Theory! I’m predicting Ray is going to supply us with a twist by season’s end. My first thought? Ray is working a long-term undercover assignment, trying to bring down Frank and maybe all of corrupt Vinci. He’s in too deep, lost his moral compass and his identity, wants out or death. The Leonard Cohen lyric from “Nevermind,” the season’s theme song, could be a clue: “I had to leave my life behind/I dug some graves you’ll never find/The story’s told with facts and lies/I have a name but never mind.” I’m banking on a future flashback scene in which we learn he got deep cover coaching from one Rust Cohle.
Ray is given separate missions by his rival masters. Job No. 1: Ray the detective is tasked with tracking down Vinci’s suddenly-missing city manager, Ben Caspere. A trip to the Vinci functionary’s ransacked home reveals a man of kinky, decadent tastes. Erotica on the walls, dildos under the bed, a skeleton topped with a crown and a Virgin Mary-blue head scarf behind the desk. Caspere’s computer: gone. Ray’s gut tells him that all of this is all kinds of wrong. He suspects The Powers That Be that ordered his bosses to put him on Caspere knew exactly what he’d find—in grimy Vinci, everyone dirty—and he resolves to classify the Caspere sitch as a kidnapping in order to punt the case to someone else.
Ray roughs up the journalist, although we never see it. The camera stays in the street outside the apartment, looking up at a blinded window. We hear sounds of violence, we see the blinds go askew. Maybe director Justin Lin was just trying to be cool here—a nod to a similar scene in last year’s other brilliant crime anthology, Fargo—or maybe the storytelling wanted to save the sick spectacle of Ray going full metal brute for his other big bullying moment later in the episode. The theorizer in me wonders if the assault even happened at all, if we might eventually learn that Ray was only making it look like a beat-down was going down in that apartment.
Ray’s arc peaks with a combination punch of scenes concerning his son. It begins when Ray learns that the mean boy at school stole his sneakers and shredded them. Enraged, Ray bullies his son into giving up the kid who’s been bullying him, a boy named Aspen. It’s a humiliating shake down, marked by name-calling and actual shaking, powered by his self-hate and sense of emasculation. Ray insults Chad’s weight and his masculinity, he threatens to “pull down your pants and spank you in front of the entire cheerleading squad.” Chad coughs up a name. Aspen. “Aspen?! That’s a boy’s name?!” hollow-macho Ray snarks.
Ray tries to mellow out, tries to make amends with his son by dictating an apology into a tape recorder. (Communicating via recorded messages is the only way Ray can be vulnerable with Chad. It’s an idea he got from a book, apparently. Sweet, but pathetic. And hasn’t he heard of texting?) Still, Ray can’t let it go. He calls on Aspen at his home and makes Aspen watch as he punches his father senseless with brass knuckles. Then, this: “If you bully or hurt anyone ever again, I will come back and butt f— your mother’s corpse on the front of this goddamn lawn. 12 years old my ass. F—. You!” I guess that’s one way to feel like you actually have balls. Way to strike a blow against bullying culture (Not!), Mr. Dark Knight Detective. It was an outrageous scene of abuse, and a provocative, queasy example of how True Detective wallows in the nihilism and noxious pulp masculinity that it clearly abhors.
Ani are you okay? Are you okay, Ani? The first season of True Detective was criticized for its poor representation of women. Nagging wives, horny mistresses, whores, and victims. Season 2 offers a correction in the form of a sheriff’s detective Antigone “Ani” Bezzerides. Improvement? Debate. Ani’s expressions of “strong female character” are blunt force edginess. The first thing we learn about Ani: She really likes knives. Dig her reading material. Knives. The Complete Book of Knife Fighting. Master of the Blade: Secrets of the Deadly Art of Knife Fighting. There are two other knife-fighting tutorials, but they also double as works of philosophy. There’s A Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi, a 17th-century Kenjutsu swordsman, but the book that’s most prominently featured is Hagakure: The Book of The Samurai. The text winks back at the title of episode, for the perspective of its master warrior, Yamamoto Tsunetomo, is that the way of the samurai is “the way of dying,” which is to say that a samurai must be willing to sacrifice his life for higher ideals at any moment. Or so Wikipedia tells me. What this means for Ani remains TBD. Perhaps these books signify that Ani possesses a codified spiritual dimension to her warrior archetype, or that she’s searching for one, or that she lacks for one, like the other “hero” cops of TD season 2.
The other thing we immediately learn about Ani is how she likes her sex. Because this is really, really important when it comes to introducing female characters: Their position on sexual positions with men. It goes unspecified, but whatever it is, it’s enough to shock her most recent sexual partner to non-performance. He’s embarrassed and wants to try again. She’s done with him and needs to get to work. So we are presented with a woman who enforces rules for a living and breaks the rules in bed… Oh, God. Did I just write that? Sorry.
One of the things that I, a SoCal resident, found amusing about the first episode was how it made the vast expanse of the greater Los Angeles area seem like a really small town. Everywhere Ani went for her job, she kept running into family. During a raid on a farm suspected of housing a bordello or unlicensed porn studio or some illegal sex thing of some sort—it turned out to be a perfectly legitimate webcam/cybersex operation—Ani found her troubled sister, Athena, who thinks of herself as “a performer,” not a sex worker. Cracked Ani: “So is this some Meryl Streep expressive type of creativity?” Athena—who’s gone off her meds for an unspecified mental/emotional condition—pushed back by blasting Ani’s “unhealthy” attitudes about sex, although she seemed to intimate that Ani’s problems were rooted into prudishness. What she doesn’t know: Ani is a jumble of paradox. Sex paradox! Sex sex sex! Can we get back to the knives? Maybe next week.
Another work assignment leads Ani to another member of her family. Looking into the matter of a missing woman that city police refuse to investigate (suspicious), Ani and her partner Elvis (the names on this show!) learn that said woman, a maid by trade, was briefly employed by an alt-religion retreat center known as The Panticapaeum Institute. The hippie-ish leader of this maybe-cult preaches a gospel of soulful existentialism that asks adherents to reconcile two opposing notions: That everything is meaningless and that God did not create a meaningless universe, a profound paradox (more paradox!) that says he learned at the knee of Beat poet Allen Ginsberg. Basically: It’s New Age Ecclesiastes. Panticapaeum’s paterfamilias also happens to be Ani’s father, and their relationship is marked by high drama history and a strong difference of opinion about proper parenting. Back in 1978, Ani’s mom—an actress—committed suicide. Walked into the ocean and never stopped. Very Virginia Woolfy. Since that day, dad has been loathe to “impose my will on anyone”—including his children. Ani resents her father for abandoning the business of parenting; she thinks that even now, he should be trying to guide and correct wayward Athena. Dad accuses Ani of demanding this of him not out of concern for her sister, but out of selfish anger toward him, a provocation intended to “engage me through argument.” He then suggests (I think) that the only reason she decided to join law enforcement—to join forces with The Man—was to stick it to him, Mr. Counter Culture. “Prick,” she says, walking away. “Talk to your daughter.” Quipped the prick in return: “I just did.” Burn!
First: The chaotic mash-up of West and East in their distinctly American, deeply dysfunctional family. The name Bezzerides is Greek. Panticapaeum was the name of an ancient Greek city. (Today, it’s Kerch.) Athena is a Greek deity, the goddess of wisdom. Antigone, an icon of ancient Greek lit, was the product of the illicit coupling of Oedipus with his mom, Jocasta. After the Gods rain havoc in their world as punishment for their sexual transgression, Jocasta kills herself and Oedipus blinds himself. (As I write these words, a tangential thought hits me: Chinatown, the greatest L.A. noir ever to come out of Hollywood, hinged a family secret involving incest.) Antigone’s name means “in place of one’s parents.” Antigone’s rebel, fatal heroism was located in putting higher ideals—divine law—over the law of men. Now, here’s True Detective giving us a family that evokes all that Greek stuff, yet has them looking to other traditions—or crazy—to find meaning. Somewhere in the stars, Athena weeps for the death of reason. We’ll see how much more of this gets reflected and played out in Ani’s story.
Second: Given True Detective’s genre and genre-aware storytelling, “Bezzerides” is surely a shout out to crime novelist and film noir screenwriter A.I. Bezzerides. His books include The Long Haul, which was turned into the movie They Drive By Night, and his scripts include the wild and weird Mickey Spillane adaptation Kiss Me Deadly, famous for its A-bomb anxiety and apocalyptic ending.
Third: Through the fragmented Bezzerides clan, True Detective introduces a conspicuous theme, the business of acting, and the risky, unhealthy practice of pretending to be someone you’re not. We’ll get more of this in Paul Woodrugh’s story line, too.
He Drives By Night. Paul Woodrugh’s story line was the least serviced, but he made a big, intriguing impression, especially in scenes in which women seemed keenly bent on servicing him… if you know what I mean. (Sorry.) We meet the strapping motorcycle cop—cue CHiPS theme song!—as he pulls over a stoned wannabe starlet driving recklessly on the PCH. She tries to get off by strongly suggesting she’d be willing to get him off. (Again: Sorry.) We are led to believe that this Dudley Do-right just said no. The actress plays woman-in-red femme fatale and gets revenge by claiming Paul propositioned her, not vice versa, and so Paul is relieved of duty pending the outcome of an Internal Affairs investigation.
Paul’s internal affairs are murky, for sure. His suspension drives him bonkers. The cop—a war veteran with secret scars to prove it; an action addict who may have also spent some time doing some (shady?) merc work for a private military contractor—needs to be on the street, needs to be in the s—, otherwise, he’s lost. He seeks sanctuary at the apartment of his very hot girlfriend, who apparently does nothing for a living except wait around for him to show up and screw her. You’re ready to throw a rock at True Detective for giving us one more woman defined by her relationship to sex and men when we realize it’s a passable set-up for an important character reveal: We learn that Paul can’t get it up without popping some little blue pills, and more, takes no pleasure in being pleasured by her. Is he impotent? Is he sexually confused? Is he suffering from PTSD? Is he hiding something? Paul is curiously strange, indeed.
…Where he finds the corpse sitting at a picnic table. Eyes burned out. Belly gutted. Crotch bloodied.
It’s Ben Caspere, of course. Throughout the episode, we’ve watched a mystery man long haul Caspere’s lifeless body up the freeway, a peculiar black object by his side. It looked to me like… The Maltese Falcon? The mounting dread produced by this creepy what-is-it?—very film noir—was probably my favorite thing about the episode. The convenience/coincidence of Paul stumbling upon the body made me roll my eyes, but I can roll with it.
And so it goes that all the story lines converge. Ray is sent to manage the sitch by the Powers That Be who have him chasing Caspere. Ani and Elvis are assigned to the case, as Caspere landed on their turf. They meet Paul, everyone introduces themselves, and Justin Lin’s camera soars high and away, the lit-up crime scene blazing in the dark, as a grunge cover of “All the Gold in California” plays. So endeth “The Western Book of The Dead”; so begins the second season of True Detective.",Collider,Ew,"Here is the rewritten document:

Warning: This article contains spoilers from True Detective Season 2.

The Handsome Family's haunting ballad ""Far From Any Road"" captured the essence of True Detective Season 1, with its blend of dark, poetic lyrics and an infectious rhythm that made it almost danceable. In contrast, Leonard Cohen's lugubrious ""Nevermind"" serves as the theme song for Season 2, its ominous declarations (""I live among you, well-disguised"") and sparse, percussive beat perfectly capturing the show's brooding, sluggish atmosphere.

The murder that sets off the season's events is not fully revealed until the end of the premiere, ""The Western Book of the Dead,"" and it brings together three troubled, wayward cops from different law enforcement departments. There's Ray Velcoro (Colin Farrell), a detective with deep, corrupt connections to the Vinci district's Mayor's office and the local gangster Frank Semyon (Vince Vaughn), who is trying to go clean with his Lady Macbeth-esque wife (Kelly Reilly). Velcoro's introduction features him drunkenly berating his son about his shoes and beating up a small-time journalist to protect Semyon, who once helped the detective exact revenge on his wife's attacker and rapist. Farrell brings a sense of gravitas to the role, but Nic Pizzolatto's clichéd design for Velcoro and his attempts at redemption make the character hard to take seriously.

Velcoro's partner on the case, Ani Bezzerides (Rachel McAdams), is another overly hardened, cynical character, with a backstory that involves a strange cult run by her father (David Morse) and a cold, troubled relationship with a colleague. McAdams brings a natural charm to the role, but the character feels thin and simplistic, a heroic cynic driven by a bleak sense of morality. The episode's direction by Justin Lin is competent, but the real problem lies in Pizzolatto's shallow characterizations and the bland, sex-obsessed world he's created.

Despite the watchability of the episode, thanks to some impactful editing and smart compositions, the overall perspective is bleak and pessimistic, with no recognition of the archetypes being trotted out. It's a world of damaged, brooding masculinity, where the only utility is the performances of the actors, which are unfortunately overshadowed by the poor writing. As the season progresses, one can only hope that the show finds its footing and delivers on the promise of its first season.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Entertainment Weekly:

Warning: Spoilers for True Detective Season 2 ahead.

It's fascinating to note that True Detective Season 1 utilized The Handsome Family's haunting ballad ""Far From Any Road,"" which, despite its grisly lyrics, had a certain swing to it – a reflection of the horrific, absorbing police procedural that was elevated by Cary Fukunaga's cinematic direction and the furiously engaged performances of its leads. In contrast, Season 2 co-opts Leonard Cohen's lugubrious ""Nevermind"" as its theme song, a string of unsettling pronouncements (""I live among you/well-disguised"") held together by a minimal, percussive beat and soulful flavor courtesy of a cadre of back-up singers. And Cohen's song is similarly reflective of the pickled, overtly brooding mood and sluggish tempo of True Detective Season 2, which centers on a quartet of modern-day Californians thrown into tumult when a crooked government official is found dead, his eyes burned out by acid.

That murder, which isn't fully seen until the end of the season premiere, ""The Western Book of the Dead,"" brings together three brooding and wayward cops from separate law enforcement departments. This starts with Ray Velcoro (Colin Farrell), a detective working out of the Vinci district with deep, corrupt connections to both the Mayor's office and Frank Semyon (Vince Vaughn), a local, brutal gangster trying to go clean with his Lady Macbeth-esque wife (Kelly Reilly). Velcoro's opening salvo includes drunkenly berating his son about the shoes he's wearing and beating up a small-time journalist to protect Semyon, who once helped the detective exact some revenge on his wife's attacker and rapist. Farrell is a strong, imposing performer, and he makes an absurdly cynical character halfway believable, despite Nic Pizzolatto's inexplicable self-seriousness design for Velcoro and his attempts at redemption.

This might have been more believable if Rachel McAdams's Ani Bezzerides, Velcoro's impending partner on the case, wasn't also almost laughably overtly hardened. And of course, like Velcoro, part of Bezzerides's design is of an entanglement of sex and vengeance, as she seems to be still working out her youth in the strange cult run by her father (David Morse) through her cold relationship with a colleague. Again, McAdams is a performer of visceral grace and natural charm, but the character she's given feels thin and simplistic, a heroic cynic obsessed with the job and some bleak sense of morality. There's no tang in the environs or the language, just a handsomely lensed melange of the worlds of Chinatown and Michael Mann's Thief. Justin Lin directs the episode with forceful competence, the best example of which is the sequence when Velcoro beats up the journalist, but the problem here is primarily Pizzolatto's characterizations and the jungle of bland sexual hang-ups he's devised here.

There's always a chance that True Detective Season 2 will be a late bloomer, but even if this will end up being just an agonizingly slow wind-up to a perfect pitch, the self-satisfied cynicism that plagues ""The Western Book of the Dead"" displays little of the ambition that Season 1 had, which was evident from the series premiere. There's a general watchability to all of this, thanks largely to some seriously impactful editing and smart compositions, but the perspective is simply that everything is the worst. It's main utility is brooding, damaged masculinity, typified by Taylor Kitsch's Paul Woodrugh, the motorcycle cop who needs viagra to have sex with his girlfriend and likes to ride his bike at night along winding mountain roads without his lights on. And yet there's no recognition in the script or in Lin's direction to suggest that either of them understand that they are dealing in archetypes here, a grisly outlook given almost no complexity. ""We get the world that we deserve"" says Velcoro in the trailers for True Detective Season 2, and you can feel that sickened, unconvincing attitude throughout the very first episode.

True Detective Season 2 is benched.

Sydney Bucksbaum is a writer at Entertainment Weekly covering all things pop culture – but TV is her one true love. She currently lives in Los Angeles but grew up in Chicago so please don't make fun of her accent when it slips out.

It's time for True Detective Season 2 to get off the air.

The HBO series, which premiered in 2015, has been struggling to find its footing since its critically acclaimed first season. The latest installment, which centers on a quartet of modern-day Californians who are thrown into tumult when a crooked government official is found dead, has been met with lukewarm reception.

1.0,"Sometimes our high school friendships don't stand the test of time. Especially under pressure.
That's what Rachel Bilson discovered when she shared a throwback photo of her and former classmate Rami Malek two years ago. Apparently the Mr. Robot star messaged Bilson asking her to take down the photo, and she obliged.
The OC alum recounted the mixup while sitting down for the latest episode Dax Shepard's podcast, Armchair Expert. ""Rami was a good friend of mine,"" Bilson said. ""We were the same crew. We did The Crucible together senior year. We were the leads in it together, all these things. We kind of kept in contact a little bit.""
When Malek's star was soaring during the 2019 awards season thanks to his turn as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody (which would eventually win him the Oscar), Bilson thought it would be fun to share a photo from their senior year on Instagram.
""I had posted a throwback of us from our senior trip to New York, Broadway. We were super-nerdy, just the dorkiest picture of both of us,"" she recalled. ""But I throw it up 'cause it's funny, and I think it's so important to be able to make fun of yourself, and he had like a gold chain, and I'm like, 'Rami where'd you get the gold chain?' Whatever. So I'm just being funny, we were good friends.""
Bilson said she was taken aback by Malek's reaction, but that she found out from his stylist that Malek didn't like the photo of himself. ""She was like, 'Well, it's not a great picture of him.' Okay, I'm sorry. We were 16!"" Bilson said. ""It was what it was. It was right before the Oscars, and I remember [The O.C. creator] Josh Schwartz being like, 'You did him dirty! He's about to be nominated.' And I'm like, 'What do you mean? This was my friend; it's a funny picture.'""
Still, Bilson honored Malek's wishes and took the photo down, even writing him back to apologize. ""I wrote to him a really nice message, like, 'I'm so sorry. Go get the Oscar, you're doing amazing.' And I never hear anything back,"" she said. ""But I was super-bummed because he was always so nice and we were good friends, and I'm a big fan of not taking yourself seriously, especially at that level of fame and talent. But look, he wants to be super-respected, it's his thing, so I respected it. I took it down. I was just a little bummed at how it was handled.""
A week later, Bilson checked her Instagram DMs and was surprised to find a message there from Malek. ""But it wasn't like, 'Hey! How are you?' It was straight to 'I would really appreciate it if you take that down, I'm a really private person,'"" she said. ""I was like, 'Oh s---, okay.' I get like really hot, I like start sweating, and I get all nervous.""
Malek's reps did not immediately respond to EW's request for comment.","There's no bad blood between Rachel Bilson and Rami Malek!
The O.C. actress, 39, said on Tuesday that she and the Bohemian Rhapsody actor, 39, had patched things up after she previously revealed that Malek had asked her to delete an old photo of the two from high school she had posted on Instagram.
""Rami and I actually have talked since that came out. He connected with me, and we're all good,"" she said during an episode of the LadyGang podcast. ""He was so sweet and we're totally fine now and we talked about it and we're good.""
She added, ""He was so gracious, and I totally understood where he was coming from and he understood me. And I was just so happy we were able to squash it and, like, move on.""
Bilson also said she didn't realize that the story would gain so much attention after she mentioned it on an episode of Dax Shepard and Monica Padman's Armchair Expert podcast last month.
""My friend sent me a CNN link to it. I was like, 'Are you kidding me?'"" she told the LadyGang hosts Keltie Knight, Becca Tobin and Jac Vanek.
Bilson admitted that the situation had caused quite a bit of anxiety, which she sought professional help for.
""I was so mortified though. Like, I was having a panic attack,"" she said. ""I had to go to therapy that day, and I was like, 'I am having anxiety. I did not want this to resurface in this way. I feel so bad. Oh my god. Rami is going to think I'm doing this again.'""
She concluded that, while she was embarrassed in the moment, she was happy the incident could allow the pair to reconnect.
""It actually turned out to be a good thing for a reason, because we were able to reconnect and, like, make it better and everything is great,"" she said.
A representative for Malek did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.
Back in 2019, Bilson shared a throwback snap of herself and Malek as teenagers in New York City.
""Hey @ramimalek where'd you get that gold chain?"" she captioned the post at the time, poking fun of the star and his past '90s fashion look.
Bilson also added the hashtags ""#tbt"" ""#oscarworthy"" and ""#dontforgetthelittlepeople"" to her post as well.
During her conversation on Armchair Expert, Bilson noted that she and Malek both attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California, and explained that the pair had a past friendship.
""Rami was a good friend of mine. We were [in] the same crew,"" she said on Armchair Expert. ""We did The Crucible together senior year, we were the leads in it together — all these things. We kind of kept in contact a little bit.""
So when Malek began to gain recognition during the 2019 awards season for his role as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, Bilson thought it would be fun to share the throwback photo on social media.
""So obviously, he gets super famous and he's always been extremely talented, a really amazing actor, even in high school,"" she explained. ""I had posted a throwback of us from our senior trip to New York, Broadway. We're super nerdy, [it was] just the dorkiest picture of the both of us. But I throw it up, 'cause it's funny and I think it's so important to be able to make fun of yourself.""
But after sharing the photo, Bilson said that Malek reached out to her directly in regards to the snap she shared.
""I don't usually check my DMs on my Instagram and maybe a week goes by and I actually look and I have a message from Rami,"" the Hart of Dixie star said. ""But it wasn't like, 'Hey! How are you?!' It was straight to, 'I would really appreciate if you take that down. I'm a really private person.'""
The response, Bilson said, caught her off guard and caused her to panic.
""I was like, 'Oh, s---! OK.' I get really hot and start sweating,"" she said. ""I'm all nervous, like, 'Oh god! What did I do?' He was a good friend, it's a funny picture, you know? I don't take myself that seriously.""
""I'm friends with his stylist and she was like, 'Well it's not a great picture of him,'"" Bilson continued, before she shared another interaction she had with The O.C. creator about the photo. ""It was right before the Oscars and I remember Josh Schwartz being like, 'You did him dirty. He's about to be nominated.'""
""I was like, I guess I should've found something more flattering,"" the actress added. ""But I removed it and I even wrote to him a really nice message: 'I'm so sorry. Go get the Oscar! You're doing amazing.' And I never heard anything back, which is fine. But I was super bummed because he was always so nice and we were good friends.""",Ew,People,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document:

Rachel Bilson Recounts Unfortunate Encounter with Former Classmate Rami Malek Over Throwback Photo

In a recent episode of Armchair Expert, actress Rachel Bilson opened up about her experience with former high school classmate Rami Malek, which ultimately led to a disappointing conclusion. 

Bilson revealed that the two were close friends during their high school years, having shared the lead roles in their senior year production of The Crucible. Despite drifting apart, they maintained some level of contact over the years. 

During the 2019 awards season, as Malek's star continued to rise following his critically acclaimed performance as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, Bilson decided to share a humorous throwback photo from their senior trip to New York on her Instagram account. 

The image, which showcased the duo's nerdy side, included Malek sporting a gold chain. Bilson intended the post to be light-hearted and poked fun at their younger selves. However, she was caught off guard by Malek's reaction to the photo. 

According to Bilson, Malek's stylist reached out to inform her that the actor was not pleased with the image. Bilson was taken aback, given their past friendship and the playful nature of the post. She recalled that The O.C. creator Josh Schwartz jokingly remarked that she had done Malek a disservice, particularly considering the Oscar nomination that was forthcoming. 

Despite her initial surprise, Bilson opted to remove the photo and extended an apology to Malek. ""I wrote him a really nice message, congratulating him on his success and wishing him well at the Oscars,"" she explained. Although she did not receive a response, Bilson respected Malek's wishes and prioritized his privacy.

Interestingly, a week later, Bilson received a direct message from Malek himself, reiterating his request to take down the photo. Bilson described her response as nervous, having been unprepared for the direct approach.

Rachel Bilson's Blast from the Past: A ""Throwback"" Photo That Caused a Rift with Rami Malek

Rachel Bilson is opening up about a surprising fallout with her former high school friend Rami Malek, and it's all because of a simple social media post.

The O.C. alum sat down with Dax Shepard on his Armchair Expert podcast to share the story of how she inadvertently upset the Mr. Robot star. It all started when Bilson posted a throwback photo of the two from their senior year trip to New York City. The snap showed the pair looking, in her words, ""super-nerdy"" and sporting a gold chain - a humorous moment that Bilson thought was harmless.

However, Malek didn't see the humor in it. He messaged Bilson, asking her to take the photo down, and she was taken aback by his reaction. According to Bilson, Malek's stylist explained that he didn't like the photo of himself, which Bilson found surprising, given that it was a candid shot from their teenage years.

Despite being ""bummed"" by the situation, Bilson opted to respect Malek's wishes and removed the photo. She even wrote him a heartfelt apology, wishing him all the best ahead of the Oscars, where he would eventually take home the award for his portrayal of Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody.

However, the incident left a sour taste in Bilson's mouth. She felt that Malek, who had been a good friend, was taking himself too seriously. ""I'm a big fan of not taking yourself seriously, especially at that level of fame and talent,"" she said.

1.0,"Danny Amendola appears to be changing his tone on Instagram.
The post came soon after Amendola’s now-deleted Instagram post, where he slammed Culpo, 26, as “f—– up” and blamed her very public “lifestyle” for their split.
“I believe there should be a boundary btw private life and social media. Olivia believes in fishbowl lifestyle. This fundamental difference was huge in our relationship,” Amendola began.
“Olivia chooses and wants to be noticed on the internet and in Hollywood to make money. Which was hard for me to understand but quickly had to learn. Where as [sic] the cost of fame in this world doesn’t appeal to me. I play ball for one reason and that’s RESPECT,” Amendola continued.
The NFL star later concluded the message by seemingly shading Culpo’s rumored beau Zedd.
A rep for Culpo did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.
This wouldn’t be the first time Amendola has shaded the Russian-German DJ, 29.
Just days after their flirty encounter, Amendola appeared to share his thoughts about Culpo, whom he was last connected to in January, possibly moving on with Zedd — using a line from Pulp Fiction.
While laying in his bed shirtless, Amendola recorded himself watching the film on his laptop and panned his phone towards the screen as Bruce Willis’ character talked about “Zed’s chopper.” The NFL player made sure to include Willis’ final line of “Zed’s dead, baby, Zed’s dead” — and his rock hard abs — before cutting off the clip.
Culpo and Amendola first made their relationship Instagram official in February 2016. The pair parted ways in March 2018 before getting back together in the fall.
In October 2018, however, a source told PEOPLE that Culpo and Amendola cooled off after the NFL pro was photographed getting close with Miami-based CBS sports journalist Bianca Peters.
Days later, Culpo all but declared the relationship over by wearing a brand new men’s Rolex watch on her wrist the same day Amendola was celebrating his 33rd birthday.
“Looks like this is my present now. HAPPY BDAY TO ME,” Culpo wrote over her new piece of jewelry.
Then on New Year’s Eve, the model and Amendola both posted nearly identical video clips of fireworks going off on a beach, leading to speculation that the pair celebrated together and have reconciled.
Despite the speculation, their reconciliation was never confirmed and a rep for Culpo declined PEOPLE’s request for comment at the time.","Danny Amendola is sharing his side of the story.
In a lengthy Instagram post, which has since been deleted, the football player is airing his grievances about his recent split from model Olivia Culpo. The 33-year-old kicks things off by slamming Olivia's lifestyle choices, like her desire ""to be noticed on the internet and in Hollywood to make money.""
""I believe there should be a boundary btw (sic) private life and social media. Olivia believes in fishbowl lifestyle,"" he explains. ""This fundamental difference was huge in our relationship. If you're my real friend you know I'm private.""
He adds that fans will never see a photo of his family members because ""that's for their protection from those who criticize and judge."" Instead, the athlete chooses to nail pictures in his home to remind himself of the people he cares about.
Olivia, on the other hand, seems to take a more worldly approach to life. ""She gets so mad at me for not posting her on social media, but I think this s--t is sometimes fake, sometimes toxic, but sometimes beautiful. And I felt like she had enough pictures online anyway,"" he claims.
Danny goes on to claim that during the course of their relationship he ""quickly had to learn"" that Olivia wanted media attention, which was difficult for him, because the ""cost of fame in this world doesn't appeal to me.""
He acknowledges that he's made mistakes in their relationship because he's ""an idiot,"" but adds, ""She's fucked up too.""
Despite being a star in his own right, he says that he plays football ""for one reason and that's RESPECT."" Moreover, he claims that ""living a public image isn't my choice,"" but he has ""learned to deal"" with the consequences of the lifestyle.
The on-again-off-again couple is ""not together as of late,"" but he says he still feels the need to address the recent reports surrounding his relationship. ""Reading all these wild stories about her and I, and seeing Olivia with other men, I just wanted to personally clear the air out here,"" Amendola explains.
The lengthy IG statement comes off as bitter in tone, but he shares that they had ""amazing times together,"" despite the drama. ""The universe brought her and I together to enjoy life, love, and learn. We celebrated that as often as we could."" He candidly shares, ""And the sex was f--king crazy too.""
He concludes his rant on a positive note: ""Not sure what's in the future but the only thing I care about is her HAPPINESS. And if that's dancing with scrony (sic) little f--ks, so be it. I'm happy too. With that said! Liv! My beautiful ex-Gf!""
After deleting the post, Danny was seemingly in a joking mood. ""Now that that's over, let's party,"" he quipped.
Olivia has yet to respond to the heated IG rant, which he tagged her in.

It looks like Danny Amendola is switching up his Instagram game, and we've got the scoop!

The NFL star's latest post comes on the heels of his now-deleted rant, where he slammed ex-girlfriend Olivia Culpo, 26, as ""f----- up"" and blamed her very public lifestyle for their split.

""I believe there should be a boundary between private life and social media,"" Amendola wrote. ""Olivia believes in a fishbowl lifestyle. This fundamental difference was huge in our relationship.""

Amendola went on to say that Culpo's desire for online attention and fame didn't jive with his own values. ""Olivia chooses and wants to be noticed on the internet and in Hollywood to make money. Which was hard for me to understand but quickly had to learn. Where as the cost of fame in this world doesn't appeal to me. I play ball for one reason and that's RESPECT,"" he continued.

But that's not all, folks! Amendola also seemed to throw some shade at Culpo's rumored beau, Zedd.

This isn't the first time Amendola has taken a dig at the Russian-German DJ, 29. Just days after their flirty encounter, Amendola shared a cryptic message that seemed to reference Culpo moving on with Zedd.

Laying in bed shirtless (because, why not?), Amendola recorded himself watching Pulp Fiction on his laptop and panned his phone towards the screen as Bruce Willis' character talked about ""Zed's chopper."" The NFL player made sure to include Willis' final line of ""Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead"" — and his rock-hard abs — before cutting off the clip.

Culpo and Amendola first made their relationship Instagram official in February 2016, but things got rocky in March 2018. They briefly rekindled their romance in the fall, but it looks like they're done for good this time.

In October 2018, a source told PEOPLE that Culpo and Amendola cooled off after the NFL pro was spotted getting cozy with Miami-based CBS sports journalist Bianca Peters.

Days later, Culpo seemed to declare the relationship over by flaunting a brand new men's Rolex watch on her wrist — the same day Amendola was celebrating his 33rd birthday.

""Looks like this is my present now. HAPPY BDAY TO ME,"" Culpo wrote over her new piece of jewelry.

Then on New Year's Eve, the model and Amendola both posted nearly identical video clips of fireworks going off on a beach, leading to speculation that the pair celebrated together and had reconciled. But a rep for Culpo declined PEOPLE's request for comment at the time.

On Wednesday, the 63-year-old singer commented under the rapper's Instagram post, accusing him of using her hit 1985 song ""Into the Groove"" without permission.
""Read your messages [for] illegal usage of my song get into the groove!"" she wrote, seemingly implying that the pop icon had already reached out to Lanez privately with no response.
Throughout the month, Lanez, 29, has been promoting his new 80s-inspired album, Alone at Prom, on social media.
The song Madonna is referring to is ""Pluto's Last Comet"" from Lanez's latest project. The rapper hasn't publicly responded to Madonna's message.
Representatives for Madonna and Lanez did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.
Madonna's claims come as Lanez is already in the midst of legal troubles as his trial continues for allegedly shooting Megan Thee Stallion in the foot after a party last summer.
Lanez was charged in October 2020 with one felony count each of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, personal use of a firearm, and carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle. He pleaded not guilty to both charges in November 2020. He could face 22 years and eight months in prison if convicted of said charges.","Madonna is beefing with Tory Lanez ... she says he's using one of her famous songs without her permission, and that's illegal!
Madonna called out the rapper on Instagram, leaving a comment on one of his recent posts and claiming ""illegal usage"" of her song, ""Into The Groove.""
It sounds like Madonna even slid in his direct messages to tell him off ... she's demanding he read his messages.
The song in question here is Tory's recent track, ""Pluto's Last Comet"" ... and he's been promoting it on his social media ... but Madonna's clearly not a fan. She believes the song -- especially the beginning instrumental -- is a rip-off of her earlier work.
As you know ... Tory's been getting himself into tons of trouble recently, mainly with his Megan Thee Stallion shooting case.
As we reported, a cop took the stand earlier this month and claimed TL shouted ""Dance bitch, dance!"" while firing gunshots at the ground near Megan's feet, subsequently injuring her.

1.0,"Since Konami’s Silent Hill series features dead wives, hallucinations, and foggy, physical manifestations of grief, its horror is arguably very psychological, and some fans seem confused about Bloober’s distinction.
But all Babieno means, he explained to Engadget, is that Bloober is ready to branch out from the slow-moving, cryptic games it’s become entwined with.
This seems encouraging to me. Bloober’s recent “reimagining” of the Layers of Fear series was disappointing evidence of the studio’s inability to handle some sensitive topics, like mental illness and women’s issues like “hysteria,” with grace. Bloober needs a refresh. And since the Silent Hill 2 remake, which does not yet have a release date, will also tackle many fragile topics, now is the perfect time for Bloober to reassess its approach to games.
“We are touching something sacred,” Babieno said about working on Silent Hill 2.
He understands that his studio’s interpretation of the 2001 game will be divisive no matter what, but as part of Bloober’s new mass-appeal initiative, Babieno said players can expect all forthcoming titles to have “a lot of gameplay mechanics” and to “be much bigger” than past Bloober games.","Silent Hill 2 Remake and Layers of Fear developer Bloober team is officially moving on from psychological  horror games to instead focus on something more ""mass-market"".
As reported by Engadget, 2023's Layers of Fear — which was an all-in-one remake of sorts of the first two games and their DLC — will be the studio's final foray into the psychological horror genre, which also included games like The Medium, Blair Witch, and Observer.
Switching over to what's internally known as Bloober Team 3.0, however, the studio will begin making horror games that are more action focused and require more from the player, perhaps closer to something like Resident Evil.
""We focused on the story, we focused on the mood, we focused on the quality of graphics and music, but we didn’t put a lot of attention on the gameplay mechanics,"" said Bloober Team co-founder Piotr Babieno. ""It wasn’t our target. But we decided that there was a ceiling that we couldn’t break if we did not deliver something fresh, something new.
""We decided that our next titles should be much more mass-market oriented. We’d like to talk with more people. We’d like to deliver our ideas, with our DNA, not by environment or storytelling, but by action. So all of our future titles will have a lot of gameplay mechanics. They will be much bigger.""
The first of these games will be the Silent Hill 2 remake, though Bloober Team is yet to announce when this will be coming exactly. Announced in October 2022, the remake promises to have the original story told across updated, seamless gameplay with no loading screens, but these extras have led to some pretty frightening PC system requirements. Bloober Team is also working on a game for publisher Rogue Games, which the two companies announced in 2021. The game title and theme have yet to be announced, so the word is out if it will follow Bloober's new ambitions toward more action-oriented horror games.",Kotaku,Ign,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document:

**Bloober's Shift in Direction: A New Approach to Silent Hill**

Bloober's studio is ready to venture beyond its signature slow-moving, cryptic games, as revealed by Bloober's Babieno in an interview with Engadget. This marks a significant departure from the studio's traditional approach, which has earned it a reputation for psychological horror.

With the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake, Bloober aims to tackle delicate topics with more finesse. The studio's previous attempt at reimagining the Layers of Fear series fell short, struggling to address sensitive issues like mental illness and women's rights. This new direction is a welcome change, allowing Bloober to reassess its approach to gaming.

""We are touching something sacred,"" Babieno emphasized, acknowledging the gravity of working on Silent Hill 2. The studio understands that its interpretation will be divisive, but as part of its new mass-appeal initiative, players can expect more gameplay mechanics and larger-scale experiences.

Bloober's new approach signals a commitment to growth and evolution, and fans are eagerly awaiting the results.","Here is the rewritten document in the style of IGN:

Bloober's Shift in Direction: A New Leaf for Silent Hill 2?

The horror genre has long been synonymous with Bloober, but with the announcement of the Silent Hill 2 remake, fans are wondering what this means for the studio's approach to games. In a recent interview, Bloober's Babieno explained that the studio is looking to branch out from its slow-moving, cryptic games and appeal to a wider audience.

This shift in direction couldn't come at a better time. Bloober's recent ""reimagining"" of the Layers of Fear series was met with criticism for its handling of sensitive topics like mental illness and women's issues. The studio's new initiative promises to bring more gameplay mechanics and bigger experiences to the table.

""We are touching something sacred,"" Babieno said about working on Silent Hill 2, acknowledging the responsibility that comes with tackling such an iconic game. The remake, which still lacks a release date, will undoubtedly be a divisive project, but Babieno is committed to delivering an experience that will resonate with fans.

What does this mean for Bloober's future projects? Expect more emphasis on gameplay and bigger, more expansive worlds. The studio is looking to make a splash with its next titles, and with the Silent Hill 2 remake leading the charge, things are looking up.

1.0,"A guide to S+ Rank every Rampage quest in Monster Hunter Rise, because the better you score, the more rewards, like Defender Tickets and monster materials, you'll earn. This Rampage Guide covers how to prepare for a Rampage Quest, how to manage and use installations efficiently, how to complete each Sub-Assignment, and what to do to S-Rank Rampages.
Watch the video below to see a concise guide on how to S Rank Rampage Quests in Monster Hunter Rise!
The key to S+ Ranking Rampage quests is completing sub-assignments. Completing these secondary objectives will help to increase your Stronghold Level throughout the quest, unlocking progressively stronger and better installations, too. Regardless of sub-assignments, repelling as many monsters as possible should be a main goal that consistently adds points to your rank and Stronghold Level. These tasks are indeed easier when in multiplayer.
Check the Sub-Assignments under the mission’s Quest Info to see how heavily they’re weighted in the rank equation - and keep in mind, though Slay the Apex, Complete with 3 Faints or Less, and Defend the Gate are always sub-assignments, the rest change depending on the quest. Now, prep for the sub-assignments before leaving.
There aren’t many sub-assignments you can prepare for in advance, but you can prepare your equipment for the leader of the horde, which is the most dangerous enemy of all. Max Blight Resistance can be useful in general. The Mizutsune Armor set would work well against Apex Mizutsune, and max Poison Resistance is useful against Apex Rathian, which inflicts a powerful Noxious Poison.
As for items, dusts like Life Powder are helpful in group missions, and because a huge range of monsters invade, most curative items could be useful as well as an additional Farcaster to easily travel between areas. Unfortunately, Poison Smoke Bombs don't work on Rampage monsters.
Bring a Palico instead of a Palamute for its superior support skills. Palicoes can also help with the sub-assignments to Inflict an Elemental Blight and Inflict a Status Ailment. Look for Palicoes that have the Assist or Gathering Type, as these occasionally have skills that inflict Blights, like Shock Tripper, or Ailments like Poison Purr-ison. Though, you can’t entirely rely on your Palico to do the whole job for you.
And as a quick reminder, Blights have “blight” in the name, and need to be inflicted by other monsters, Palicoes, Endemic Life, or special items. Ailments, like Poison, Paralysis, and Sleep, can be inflicted by your own weapons and Palicoes with certain skills. Blight and stun effects can be inflicted with the tools given to you during a Rampage Quest fairly easily, but you’ll definitely want to prepare to inflict Ailments, as options for those are more limited. And, unfortunately, Poison Smoke Bombs don’t work here.
At the beginning of a Rampage, and in-between hordes, you’ll have the opportunity to set up Installations. Setting up a certain number of these is often a Sub-Assignment.
Some Sub-Assignments instruct you to Repel monsters using certain installations. Pay attention to the specific wording of each sub-assignment, as they aren’t always clear about which installations you need to use. If it says “Repel using a Cannon”, you need to use the mountable cannon - not an Auto-Cannon - so be sure to install what you need for the task at hand.
Don’t waste your prep time, either - once you’ve got a Dragonator or Splitting Wyvernshot, which are unlocked at Stronghold Level 3 and 5, respectively, you can reduce their cooldowns at the Power Kilns - and you can just hold A to continuously feed these flames, which reduce the cooldown for everything on the field. If you’re in a group, one of you might want to do this even while fighting monsters, because the Dragonator and Splitting Wyvern shot are just that powerful.
The Dragonbait Warrior attracts monsters to it, and is then destroyed after suffering enough damage from monsters.
Save the limited Dragonbait Warrior and put it right in front of a readied Dragonator when a big horde is incoming to target as many monsters as possible!
It can be used for the Splitting Wyvernshot as well: put a Dragonbait Warrior down in an open area when the Wyvernshot is ready to fire to hit as many monsters as possible.
Comboing these installations is a great way to repel monsters, and even occasionally clear Sub-Assignments. And yes, you have to fully repel monsters for it to count, not just land a hit.
Don't install the Limited Warriors of Kamura Village in between hordes. These NPC's generally unleash their first attack at the first sign of a monster, and are only around for a short period of time, so it’s better to wait for a group of monsters to already be present.
Lastly, in some Rampages, you move onto a second area - you’ll know from the quest details - where all installation limits and cooldowns are separate, so don’t feel like you need to save the limited installations for the end. Expect the boss monster to always easily break through the first gate fairly quickly, if there is a second area, so do spend time before the final horde to set that area up, assuming you succeed at keeping them repelled until then. Farcasters are particularly useful for easily moving between the two.
Once the monsters arrive, use the manual installations and the tools provided to you to the best of your ability.
Remember you can hold R to guard against attacks while using Installations, which also protects the installation.
Alternatively, press B and a direction to quickly dodge away, which you may want to do when targeted by poison.
The game suggests focusing on the blue-icon monsters (Gate Crashers) that b-line it to the gates, but I like to knock the green-icon monsters (Targeter) out of the air first - they’re a huge pain that target installations. Focus on the red-icon monsters (Stalkers) last, or change your target to whatever is giving your team the most trouble.
You can easily Stun monsters by aiming a Ballista’s Crag Shot at its head - but keep in mind you can only reliably do this once per monster. Further along in the mission, stunning a monster may require two crag shots to the head, but by then you should have unlocked the upgrade to shoot two Crag Shots before initiating a cooldown.
Use the Retreat Shot to push back a monster. Good to use on a monster wailing on a gate, or on one that won't stop attacking you.
Inflict Thunderblight on a massive number of monsters at once with a Cannon’s Thunder Shot, which you can charge by holding down Y while continuing to shoot the normal cannons. Thunderblight has the added bonus of making it easier to stun monsters, too!
Hold the X button to charge a Piercing Shot, which will move through all monsters in a line, dealing damage to all. You can also charge this while launching normal cannons.
Usually, install Bamboo Bombs up front and in-between hordes to get damage done immediately to incoming hordes on the floor. However, when this is a sub-assignment, install them next to monsters on their last breath (indicated by a blue icon below their type icon) to ensure a Bamboo Bomb is the final blow.
Aim Wyvernfire Artillery installations after setting them by mounting them for a short moment. If a monster comes in contact with the red laser, they’ll get hit! Align them to cross the path of a high-trafficked area, like right before a gate.
These Auto Installations can also inflict Fireblight, which deals damage over time and causes monsters to flinch more easily.
Inflicting the same blight twice on one monster is difficult (unless it’s the boss), but luckily picking up the materials Monsters drop solves that. Some of the shiny objects dropped by monsters are elemental Barrel Bombs, which inflict blight on contact. You can also pick up Explosive Kunai, which deal a fair amount of damage.
Plant those elemental Barrel Bombs within a mass of monsters, and detonate it with a fearless attack or a kunai to affect as many monsters as possible. Of course, you can always set them next to Bamboo Bombs - but it’s easier to guarantee a multihit if you’re willing to get down and dirty. Or, use the Wirebug Dash and press Y with the bomb ready on your item bar to throw it down below you.
Most of the villagers do massive damage to the monsters around them at quite a long range, and we already suggested waiting to install these when there is already a group of monsters present, but know that Master Utsushi makes the surrounding monsters rideable. Wyvern Riding is another great opportunity to try to inflict ailments or blights, like with a Pukei-Pukei’s poison or Mizutsune’s waterblight (usually by performing a Mounted Punisher), so choose wisely after initiation Master Utsushi.
Iori and Buddies inflict a blight on surrounding monsters. The rest deal massive damage.
The Counter Gong installation is what creates a Counter Signal. When activated, hat’s your queue to drop everything and repel monsters up-close and personally, as your weapons will do massive bonus damage.
How strong the Counter Signal buffs your party is dependent on the level of your Stronghold.
Most of this advice is detailed in the full guide above, but for quick reference, here is a list of Rampage sub-assignments for a quick reference.","Rampage quests are a new series of challenges unique to Monster Hunter Rise. Effectively a tower defense mode, Rampage quests allow players to manage turrets and other helpful artillery while still being able to dive directly into the fray.
Rampage quests give players unique rewards, and they allow for gathering multiple different kinds of monster materials at a time. The game provides a basic tutorial for this mode when progressing your Village Rank, and you can read our tips for Rampage quests below.
Since you can take on monsters directly to help defend Kamura village, make sure you’re adequately prepared.
Make sure to stock up on healing items and eat dango before you head out.
Keep in mind you cannot capture monsters during Rampage quests, so leave your traps behind. However, taking barrel bombs, flash bombs, and enhancement items like demondrugs and armorskins are highly effective in High Rank Rampage quests.
The Counter Signal in Monster Hunter Rise allows you to deal immense amounts of damage to any monster currently on the field. The Counter Signal only affects your attacks and does not increase the attacks of artillery or installations.
You can activate the Counter Signal by hitting the Counter Gong found at specific areas on the Rampage quest map. However, your attacks will only be empowered for a limited amount of time, so make sure that you make these moments count. You can use this time to quickly wipe out monsters and even knock Apex monsters out of potentially disastrous attacks.
Upon leveling up in the Rampage quest, you will unlock various installation types, and even receive upgrades. One of the most beneficial installation types appears as Limited Summons.
You’ll be able to pick from characters like Fugen the Elder, Hinoa and Minoto, and Master Utsushi to name just a few. Each summon provides a different kind of skill. For example, Fugen the Elder will unleash one extremely powerful attack, whereas Hinoa and Minoto will stick around for a few seconds to deal major damage to enemies in the area.
Place these summons around clusters of monsters, especially if they’re directly attacking your gate. Additionally, only some summons will be available to use at certain stages, so don’t be frugal. If you’re feeling like the situation might be dire, then go ahead and summon.
There are various installation points found on the three different stages in Rampage quests. After completing each stage, you’ll have an allotted period of time to restock on items and relocate installations. Take this time to do so, or even do so during combat when upgrades are available.
If you feel like certain installation placements aren’t working for you, don’t be afraid to move things around. Just go to an installation platform, hold A to remove it, and then press A to install a new one.
Don’t remove your Counter Gong, though. Keep that in place until you use it.",Ign,Polygon,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document:

**The Ultimate Guide to S+ Ranking Rampage Quests in Monster Hunter Rise**

Monster Hunter Rise's Rampage quests are the epitome of high-stakes hunting, and the better you score, the more rewards you'll earn. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know to S+ Rank every Rampage quest, from preparation to execution.

**Watch and Learn**

Before we dive in, watch the concise video guide below to get a quick overview of how to S Rank Rampage quests in Monster Hunter Rise.

**The Secret to S+ Ranking: Completing Sub-Assignments**

The key to S+ Ranking lies in completing sub-assignments, which are secondary objectives that add points to your rank and Stronghold Level. These tasks are easier in multiplayer, but don't worry, we've got you covered.

**Prep like a Pro**

Check the Sub-Assignments under the mission's Quest Info to see how heavily they're weighted in the rank equation. Keep in mind that Slay the Apex, Complete with 3 Faints or Less, and Defend the Gate are always sub-assignments, while the rest change depending on the quest. Prepare for these sub-assignments before leaving the gate.

**Gear Up and Get Ready**

There aren't many sub-assignments you can prepare for in advance, but you can prep your equipment for the leader of the horde, the most dangerous enemy of all. Max Blight Resistance is a good idea, and the Mizutsune Armor set works well against Apex Mizutsune. Don't forget about maxing Poison Resistance against Apex Rathian.

**Items and Palicoes**

Dusts like Life Powder are helpful in group missions, and curative items are always a good idea. Bring a Palico instead of a Palamute for its superior support skills. Look for Palicoes with the Assist or Gathering Type, as they occasionally have skills that inflict Blights or Ailments.

**Blight, Ailments, and Installations**

Remember, Blights have ""blight"" in the name and need to be inflicted by other monsters, Palicoes, Endemic Life, or special items. Ailments, like Poison, Paralysis, and Sleep, can be inflicted by your own weapons and Palicoes with certain skills. At the beginning of a Rampage, set up Installations to help you complete sub-assignments.

**Using Installations Effectively**

Setup is key, so don't waste your prep time. Once you've got a Dragonator or Splitting Wyvernshot, reduce their cooldowns at the Power Kilns. Use the Dragonbait Warrior to attract monsters and destruct them with a Dragonator or Splitting Wyvernshot. Combo these installations to repel monsters and clear Sub-Assignments.

**Rampage Strategies**

When the monsters arrive, use manual installations and tools to the best of your ability. Remember to guard against attacks while using Installations. Focus on the blue-icon monsters (Gate Crashers) that target the gates, and knock out the green-icon monsters (Targeters) that target installations.

**Inflicting Blights and Ailments**

Use the Ballista's Crag Shot to stun monsters, and the Retreat Shot to push them back. Inflict Thunderblight with a Cannon's Thunder Shot, and use Piercing Shots to deal damage to multiple monsters. Wyvernfire Artillery installations can inflict Fireblight, and Auto Installations can deal massive damage.

**Mastering the Art of Rampage**

Plant elemental Barrel Bombs within a mass of monsters, and detonate them with a fearless attack or a kunai. Use the Wirebug Dash to throw bombs down below you. Master Utsushi's installation makes surrounding monsters rideable, allowing you to inflict ailments or blights.

**The Final Showdown**

The Counter Gong installation creates a Counter Signal, which is your cue to drop everything and repel monsters up-close and personally. Your weapons will do massive bonus damage, and the Counter Signal's strength depends on your Stronghold Level.

**Conclusion**

With this guide, you'll be well on your way to S+ Ranking every Rampage quest in Monster Hunter Rise. Remember to complete sub-assignments, prepare for the leader of the horde, and use installations effectively. Happy hunting!","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Polygon:

**Monster Hunter Rise: A Guide to S+ Ranking Rampage Quests**

In Monster Hunter Rise, S+ ranking Rampage Quests is the key to unlocking the most rewards, including Defender Tickets and valuable monster materials. To help you achieve this, we've put together a comprehensive guide on how to prepare for Rampage Quests, manage and use installations efficiently, complete each Sub-Assignment, and ultimately earn that coveted S+ rank.

**The Importance of Sub-Assignments**

The secret to S+ ranking lies in completing Sub-Assignments, which are secondary objectives that add points to your rank and Stronghold Level. These tasks are often easier in multiplayer, and can be viewed in the Quest Info under the mission details. Before embarking on a quest, prep for these Sub-Assignments by gearing up with the right equipment and items.

**Gear Up and Prepare**

When it comes to equipment, consider bringing armor sets like Mizutsune, which offers max Blight Resistance, or max Poison Resistance for battling Apex Rathian. As for items, Life Powder and other curative items can be useful in group missions, and an extra Farcaster can make traveling between areas a breeze. Unfortunately, Poison Smoke Bombs won't work on Rampage monsters.

**Palico Power**

Bring a Palico instead of a Palamute for its superior support skills, which can help with Sub-Assignments like Inflicting an Elemental Blight and Inflicting a Status Ailment. Look for Palicoes with Assist or Gathering Type skills, which can inflict Blights or Ailments.

**Installations and Sub-Assignments**

At the beginning of a Rampage, you'll have the opportunity to set up Installations. Some Sub-Assignments require you to Repel monsters using specific installations, so pay attention to the wording. Don't waste your prep time, and make sure to use the Power Kilns to reduce cooldowns for your Installations.

**Combining Installations**

Combining Installations like the Dragonator and Splitting Wyvernshot can be a powerful way to repel monsters and even complete Sub-Assignments. Remember to save your limited Dragonbait Warrior and use it strategically to target as many monsters as possible.

**In the Heat of Battle**

When the monsters arrive, use your manual installations and tools to the best of your ability.

Monster Hunter Rise: A Comprehensive Guide to S-Ranking Rampage Quests

In Monster Hunter Rise, the key to success lies in mastering the art of S-Ranking Rampage Quests. By doing so, you'll unlock a treasure trove of rewards, including Defender Tickets and precious monster materials. In this guide, we'll delve into the intricacies of preparing for Rampage Quests, managing installations, completing Sub-Assignments, and ultimately, achieving that elusive S-Rank.

**The Importance of Sub-Assignments**

To S-Rank a Rampage Quest, you'll need to complete a series of Sub-Assignments. These secondary objectives are crucial in increasing your Stronghold Level, which in turn, unlocks more powerful installations. Repelling as many monsters as possible is also essential, as it consistently adds points to your rank and Stronghold Level. Multiplayer mode makes these tasks significantly easier, so gather your friends and get ready to take on the challenge.

**Preparation is Key**

Before embarking on a Rampage Quest, take a moment to review the Sub-Assignments listed under the mission's Quest Info. Note how heavily they're weighted in the rank equation, as this will help you prioritize your efforts. While some Sub-Assignments remain constant, others change depending on the quest. Prepare accordingly by equipping your Palico with the right skills and items.

**Equipment and Items**

When it comes to equipment, the Mizutsune Armor set is a solid choice against Apex Mizutsune, while maxing out Poison Resistance is essential against Apex Rathian. Don't forget to bring a Palico with superior support skills, as they can aid in completing Sub-Assignments like Inflicting an Elemental Blight or Ailment. Items like Life Powder and curative items can also prove invaluable in group missions.

**Installations and Strategies**

During a Rampage, you'll have opportunities to set up Installations. These can be game-changers in repelling monsters and completing Sub-Assignments. Pay attention to the specific wording of each Sub-Assignment, as it may require the use of specific installations. Don't waste your prep time, and make sure to reduce cooldowns at the Power Kilns. The Dragonbait Warrior, Dragonator, and Splitting Wyvernshot are particularly effective in comboing installations and repelling monsters.

**Tips and Tricks**

Remember to hold R to guard against attacks while using Installations, and press B and a direction to quickly dodge away from danger. Focus on the blue-icon monsters (Gate Crashers) first, followed by the green-icon monsters (Targeter), and finally, the red-icon monsters (Stalkers). Use the manual installations and tools provided to you to the best of your ability, and don't hesitate to use the Retreat Shot to push back a monster or the Thunder Shot to inflict Thunderblight on multiple monsters at once.

**Conclusion**

S-Ranking Rampage Quests in Monster Hunter Rise requires a deep understanding of the game's mechanics, as well as a solid strategy. By following these tips and tricks, you'll be well on your way to unlocking the rewards you desire. So, gear up, gather your friends, and get ready to take on the challenge of a lifetime."
1.0,"This Vault is found on the North-East peninsula in The Forgelands, behind a puzzle for an Epic Chest. It’s guarded by a Griffon, two Gorgons and four Soldiers.
The concept for this Vault is about blocking vents to prevent fans from spinning so you can roll Wooden Balls across to Ball Sockets. To begin, hit the Switch to spawn in a Wooden Ball, then move it in front of the fan to block the draft from the distant vent (indicated by the white air lines).
With the fan not moving, the platforms will move into place and let you move the Ball across. The middle section is curved however, so you’ll need to sit with the Ball blocking the vent’s draft to move the platforms back. Once you’re across, roll the ball into the Ball Socket behind the wall to raise the way to the next area on your right.
This next section requires a bit of setup. First, jump across the platforms on your right and get to the nearby Switch. Hit the Switch to spawn in a Wooden Box on a platform nearby: grab it with Herakles’s Strength, set it down to the left of the Switch close to the second stone walkway, then jump down to the walkway and turn around to grab the Box.
Place the box in the vent’s airflow the block it. Don’t worry! The box isn’t affected by the airflow like the Wooden Balls are. Now return to Checkpoint 2 and hit the Switch to spawn in a Wooden Ball, then roll it across the platforms to the first stone walkway.
Return to the second stone walkway and grab the Wooden Box, resetting the platforms. Head along the left across the platform and up the ledge to find another vent and fan combination. Drop the Wooden Box in the vent’s airflow to move some more platforms earlier into position. These will let you roll the Wooden Ball the rest of the way past the fan and up a ramp into a Ball Socket, raising the way to the final puzzle on your left!
This puzzle also requires a bit of setup. Glide across the gap and head up the ramp on your right to the two Switches, which spawn in a Heavy Metal Box and a Wooden Box. You need to get them across to the opposite side of this area to block a second fan-and-vent pair, but the trouble is that if you don’t have the Heavy Lifting upgrade to Herakles’s Strength, you need to take some extra steps to get the Heavy Metal Box over there.
To start, take the Wooden Box and place it in the main airflow to block it: this will move two platforms across on your left. Now push the Heavy Metal Box down the ramp and onto the far end of the platforms, then move the Wooden Box out of the airflow: the Heavy Metal Box will move away and to two more platforms.
Push the Metal Box onto them, then put the Wooden Box back into the airflow to raise the Metal Box up to where the second airflow is. Head over there and push the Heavy Metal Box into the lower area and underneath the airflow. To finish, pick up the Wooden Box and take it to the Heavy Metal Box and place it on top.
This will block the airflow to the second fan and raise a platform you need for the Wooden Ball. With everything in place, return to the start of the puzzle and spawn a Wooden Ball with the Switch. Move it into the vent’s air flow here to raise the last few platforms that will let you roll the ball all the way across and into the Ball Socket, letting you complete the Vault and get Zeus’s Lightning!","The Shrine of Aither Vault of Tartaros is in The Forgelands region. In this Immortals Fenyx Rising guide, we’ll show you how to find the Vault Entrance location, solve the dungeon’s puzzles, find and open the Epic Chest, and collect Zeus’s Lightning on your way out.
Immortals Fenyx Rising’s Shrine of Aither vault is easy to reach from the God of the Forge statue: Head north to the northernmost part of the mainland, along some high cliffs. You will find a rift on the high prairie with monsters guarding it. Defeat them and drop through the rift to access the vault.",Ign,Polygon,"Here is the rewritten document:

The Forgotten Vault lies hidden on the North-East peninsula of The Forgelands, shielding an Epic Chest behind a complex puzzle. Brave adventurers will need to overcome the formidable guardians of this ancient treasure: a Griffon, two Gorgons, and four Soldiers.

The puzzle's core concept revolves around cleverly blocking vents to halt the rotation of fans, thereby allowing Wooden Balls to roll into Ball Sockets. To initiate the sequence, trigger the Switch to spawn a Wooden Ball, then position it in front of the fan to block the airflow from the distant vent (indicated by the white air lines).

With the fan stilled, platforms will materialize, enabling the Wooden Ball to traverse the area. However, the middle section's curved design necessitates a brief pause, where the ball must block the vent's draft to reset the platforms. Once across, roll the ball into the Ball Socket concealed behind the wall to unlock the path to the next area on your right.

The subsequent section demands careful preparation. Begin by traversing the platforms on your right to reach the nearby Switch. Activate the Switch to spawn a Wooden Box on a nearby platform: seize it with Herakles's Strength, place it to the left of the Switch, adjacent to the second stone walkway, then descend to the walkway and retrieve the Box.

Position the box within the vent's airflow to block it, assuring that the box remains impervious to the airflow. Return to Checkpoint 2 and trigger the Switch to spawn a new Wooden Ball, which you can then roll across the platforms to the first stone walkway.

Retrieve the Wooden Box from the second stone walkway, resetting the platforms. Proceed left across the platform, ascending the ledge to uncover another vent and fan combination. Deposit the Wooden Box into the vent's airflow, which will shift the platforms into position, enabling the Wooden Ball to roll past the fan and up a ramp into a Ball Socket, raising the way to the final puzzle on your left.

This final challenge also necessitates meticulous setup. Glide across the gap and ascend the ramp on your right to reach the two Switches, which summon a Heavy Metal Box and a Wooden Box. Your goal is to transport these boxes across the area to block a second fan-and-vent pair, but be aware that without the Heavy Lifting upgrade to Herakles's Strength, additional steps are required to maneuver the Heavy Metal Box.

Initiate the sequence by placing the Wooden Box in the main airflow to block it, which will shift two platforms on your left. Push the Heavy Metal Box down the ramp and onto the far end of the platforms, then remove the Wooden Box from the airflow: the Heavy Metal Box will retreat to two more platforms.

Push the Metal Box onto them, then replace the Wooden Box in the airflow to elevate the Metal Box up to the second airflow. Proceed to the airflow and push the Heavy Metal Box into the lower area and underneath the airflow. Finally, retrieve the Wooden Box and place it atop the Heavy Metal Box.

This will block the airflow to the second fan, raising a platform essential for the Wooden Ball. With all components in place, return to the puzzle's starting point and spawn a new Wooden Ball using the Switch. Roll it into the vent's airflow to raise the final platforms, permitting the ball to roll across and into the Ball Socket, ultimately granting access to Zeus's Lightning!","Here is the rewritten document in the style of Polygon:

**The Forgelands Vault: A Puzzle-Laden Adventure Awaits**

Tucked away in the North-East peninsula of The Forgelands, a mysterious Vault lies hidden, guarded by a formidable Griffon, two Gorgons, and four Soldiers. But don't let the intimidating foes deter you – the real challenge lies within the Vault's ingenious puzzle.

**The Ventilation Conundrum**

To overcome this puzzle, you'll need to master the art of blocking vents to prevent fans from spinning, allowing you to roll Wooden Balls across to Ball Sockets. Begin by hitting the Switch, which spawns a Wooden Ball. Move it in front of the fan to block the draft from the distant vent, indicated by the white air lines.

With the fan idle, the platforms will shift into place, enabling you to roll the Ball across. However, the middle section presents a curveball – you'll need to position the Ball to block the vent's draft, thereby moving the platforms back into place.

**Setup and Strategy**

The next section requires careful planning. Jump across the platforms on your right, reaching the nearby Switch. Activate the Switch to spawn a Wooden Box, which you'll need to grab using Herakles's Strength. Place the Box to the left of the Switch, close to the second stone walkway. Then, jump down to the walkway and turn around to grab the Box.

Position the Box in the vent's airflow to block it, but don't worry – it won't be affected by the airflow like the Wooden Balls. Return to Checkpoint 2, hit the Switch, and roll the Wooden Ball across the platforms to the first stone walkway.

**The Final Push**

The final puzzle demands careful setup. Glide across the gap, head up the ramp on your right to the two Switches, which spawn a Heavy Metal Box and a Wooden Box. You'll need to get these Boxes across to the opposite side of the area to block a second fan-and-vent pair.

With the Heavy Metal Box in place, push it onto the platforms, then move the Wooden Box out of the airflow. The Heavy Metal Box will shift, and you'll need to repeat this process to get it to the second airflow. Finally, place the Wooden Box on top of the Heavy Metal Box to block the airflow and raise a platform you'll need to complete the Vault.

**Victory and Reward**

With everything in place, return to the start of the puzzle and spawn a Wooden Ball with the Switch. Move it into the vent's airflow, and the last few platforms will raise, allowing you to roll the Ball across and into the Ball Socket. Congratulations – you've conquered the Vault and earned Zeus's Lightning!","Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document from Polygon:

This Vault, nestled in the North-East peninsula of The Forgelands, is a puzzle waiting to be solved, much like a cross-eyed puppy waiting in a cardboard box marked ""needs good home"" abandoned on the side of the road. It's a bit busted, a little sad, and quite confused, but every fiber of me wants to love it.

Behind a puzzle for an Epic Chest, this Vault is guarded by a Griffon, two Gorgons, and four Soldiers. The concept for this Vault is about blocking vents to prevent fans from spinning, so you can roll Wooden Balls across to Ball Sockets. It's a bold statement of intent, a spiritual successor to a cult classic, and an official sequel to a AAA project that aspired to accomplish too much with too little.

To begin, hit the Switch to spawn in a Wooden Ball, then move it in front of the fan to block the draft from the distant vent (indicated by the white air lines). With the fan not moving, the platforms will move into place, and you'll be able to move the Ball across. The middle section is curved, however, so you'll need to sit with the Ball blocking the vent's draft to move the platforms back. Once you're across, roll the ball into the Ball Socket behind the wall to raise the way to the next area on your right.

This next section requires a bit of setup, like a speedboat falling from the clouds into Nebraska farmland. First, jump across the platforms on your right and get to the nearby Switch. Hit the Switch to spawn in a Wooden Box on a platform nearby: grab it with Herakles's Strength, set it down to the left of the Switch close to the second stone walkway, then jump down to the walkway and turn around to grab the Box.

Place the box in the vent's airflow to block it. Don't worry! The box isn't affected by the airflow like the Wooden Balls are. Now return to Checkpoint 2 and hit the Switch to spawn in a Wooden Ball, then roll it across the platforms to the first stone walkway.

Drop the Wooden Box in the vent's airflow to move some more platforms earlier into position. These will let you roll the Wooden Ball the rest of the way past the fan and up a ramp into a Ball Socket, raising the way to the final puzzle on your left!

This puzzle also requires a bit of setup, like flying from Los Angeles to New York City, then skipping the traffic and dropping into Central Park in an indestructible Porsche. Glide across the gap and head up the ramp on your right to the two Switches, which spawn in a Heavy Metal Box and a Wooden Box. You need to get them across to the opposite side of this area to block a second fan-and-vent pair, but the trouble is that if you don't have the Heavy Lifting upgrade to Herakles's Strength, you need to take some extra steps to get the Heavy Metal Box over there.

Initiating this mission early on is crucial, as it must be completed before undertaking the final Priority Ops mission. To begin, Ryder will receive an email from Captain Dunn shortly after the Hyperion docks on the Nexus. The Captain requests Ryder's assistance in resolving an urgent matter, prompting a visit to the Hyperion.

Upon arriving at the Hyperion, Ryder will learn that a crew member, Ruth Bekker, has contracted a dormant deadly disease, TH-314, which has resurfaced after she was awakened from cryo. Captain Dunn tasks Ryder with finding Ruth before she infects others. To advance the mission, Ryder should visit the Cryo Bay and converse with Harry, who provides valuable insights into the disease and Ruth's situation.

Harry suggests starting the search at Nexus customs, where Ryder can interact with the immigration staff. Although they are unaware of Ruth's current whereabouts, SAM recommends scanning the area, revealing that Ruth was present not long ago and seemed fine. Her intended destination was Nexus operations, where she planned to visit a friend, Teron Aminus.

Time is of the essence, and Ryder must track Ruth down quickly. Returning to the Nexus docks, Ryder will encounter an agitated worker who reports that Ruth assaulted him and commandeered a shuttle. SAM attributes her behavior to the paranoia induced by TH-314. Fortunately, the damaged shuttle can be tracked.

Boarding the Tempest, Ryder will need to travel to the Govorkam system and land on Kadara to continue the search. If Kadara has not been visited before, Ryder will need to complete the initial stages of the Hunting the Archon mission before proceeding.

Upon arriving on Kadara, Ryder should head to the Kadara port, take the elevator to the slums, and call a Nomad. Following the navigation point on the map will lead to the crashed shuttle, where a log reveals Ruth's critical condition. Scanning the area will guide Ryder to the next location.

After arriving at the designated point, Ryder should scan the ground again, leading to a nearby building where several Roekaar are holding Ruth hostage. Employing cover and strategy, Ryder can eliminate the targets, including the snipers and additional Roekaar reinforcements. With the main door unlocked, Ryder can proceed to the top room, where the Roekaar cell leader holds Ruth at gunpoint.

He suggested that I start my search at the Nexus' customs, where I would find clues about Ruth's disappearance.

**Following the Trail**

As I ventured into the Nexus docks, I encountered an immigration staff member who revealed that Ruth had been in the area recently. However, she didn't know where Ruth had gone after her file was cleared. SAM, my trusty AI companion, suggested that scanning the area might yield some results. And indeed, it did. The scan revealed that Ruth had been in the area not long ago, and she seemed fine. But her illness was taking its toll, and I knew I had to act fast.

**The Next Lead**

My search led me to Nexus operations, where I met with Ruth's friend, Teron Aminus. He informed me that Ruth had visited him recently, but she wasn't looking well. Her illness was progressing rapidly, and I knew I had to find her before it was too late. I returned to the Nexus docks, where a distraught worker told me that Ruth had attacked him and taken a shuttle. SAM revealed that the shuttle was damaged, making it easier to track.

**The Pursuit Continues**

I boarded the Tempest and set course for the Govorkam system, where I would find Ruth on the planet Kadara. As I landed in Kadara port, I took the elevator to the slums and called a Nomad. Following the nav point, I discovered the crashed shuttle, which led me to a building where Ruth was being held by the Roekaar. I eliminated the targets, and after a tense standoff, I was faced with a difficult decision: save Ruth and let the Roekaar obtain a sample of TH-314, or let her die and kill the Roekaar leader.

**The Consequences**

Regardless of my choice, the outcome was bittersweet. If I saved Ruth, she would be placed back in cryo, but her fate was far from certain. The experience left me with a sense of unease, a reminder that in the world of Mass Effect: Andromeda, the consequences of our actions can be far-reaching and unpredictable.

1.0,"The Walking Dead: A New Frontier is a series defined by contradiction. The third season of Telltale’s successful narrative game franchise, which comes to a close this week with the release of final episode “From The Gallows,” is full of interesting characters the player won’t care about. It’s painfully human but insufferably cliche. The season is ambitious in scope and underwhelming in execution, stumbling far more often than it succeeds.
A New Frontier follows Javier García, a former baseball player turned survivor when the outbreak of a zombie plague forces him to look after his sister-in-law Kate and her two children, Gabe and Mariana. What starts as a simple tale of a family scrounging for survival builds into a story that has major repercussions for other characters and entire settlements. A New Frontier has a vastly different scale than The Walking Dead’s previous seasons. This is the largest the series has ever felt.
The first two episodes, “Ties That Bind, Parts One and Two”, deftly manage to balance this growing scope with the series’ concern for individual people and their problems. It jumps from past to present, showing Javier’s life before the outbreak and focusing on his relationship with his parents and his temperamental brother David. In the present, it introduces a strong central conflict in a militant regime called the New Frontier, which is consolidating power over the wasteland in the name of maintaining order. These two threads come to a head when the New Frontier’s rise to power becomes personal for Javier.
By combining large scale politicking and Javier’s family concerns, A New Frontier wants to tell a story about navigating the pressures of leadership on a micro and macro level. What kind of father can Javier be to his nephew Gabe? Can he and David manage to reconcile their differences in the face of the zombie horde? Will Javier rise above his baser instincts and become a proper leader, or will he descend into a necessary violence in order to survive? These are interesting questions that the series cannot completely juggle.
A major problem is the role of fan favorite character Clementine. She was the player’s anchor to their morality in the first season, and her relationship with protagonist Lee Everett remains one of the most fully realized examples of a father and daughter dynamic in video games. Season Two cast her as the main protagonist, eschewing consequential decisions in favor of letting players decide who Clem was as an individual. But in A New Frontier she exists as a vestigial limb that the series cannot cut loose. Her minimal presence adds little of consequence to the plot, distracting from Javier’s story in favor of a nostalgic grasp for the past glory of the first season. She’s here only because the series can’t find a way to say goodbye.
A New Frontier can’t capture the first season’s emotional depth, but it also fails to retain what made the second season compelling. Season Two was a deeply personal story focused more on character beats that a cohesively structured plot. It moved from random happenstance to sudden tragedy with reckless, unfocused abandon. While A New Frontier takes time to paint all of its cast as human, it rarely gives them the chance to express themselves as the previous seasons did. It moves from from set piece to set piece without giving players much opportunity to learn to care about the characters.
This mistake hobbles the series. The core cast of characters is all set up with interesting, if somewhat cliche, conflicts. Javier wants to be a good person in a bad time, David wants to give up his anger, Kate struggles to navigate her love of Javier and her fear of her husband’s abusive ways, Clementine must learn to become a caring and empathetic woman in a time that demands she be also be a ruthless killer. All of these characters have interesting stories, and every single one of them is brought to life by a voice cast that offers some of the best performances in the series. But in the season’s haste to be bigger and grander than what came before, none of these personal conflicts ever receive a satisfying conclusion.
Additionally, Telltale’s technology has not aged well, even as they’ve gotten more creative with how players can express themselves through quicktime events and have embraced a more cinematic style full of sharper edits, cuts, and camera angles. A New Frontier manages a far more confident visual style that previous seasons while paradoxically seeming stilted and animatronic. As the quality of camera editing has improved, character animations remain somewhere in the realm of puppetry. This combines with vaguely worded dialog choices that fail to properly indicate tone and creates moments of unintentional comedy that undercut the dramatic tension of the various scenarios.
Telltale’s backend systems also faltered on occasion. Most egregiously, many of my decisions did not properly carry over from episode to episode, nor did my choices from previous seasons make it into the initial parts of A New Frontier. The latter issue is mitigated by a small opening segment that allows you to personalize Clementine’s character by selecting major flashpoints from previous episodes, but the former left no solution other than to replay episodes that I’d previously completed.
A New Frontier is a roller coaster ride of successes met with equal or greater failures. It takes time to define the world in stark detail, aiming to expand the series’ scope to something as deeply concerned with society at large as it is with individual morality. It crafts memorable characters with clear struggles and goes to great lengths to stress the interpersonal dynamics between them. But it also later abandons the interesting set up in favor of bombast and grandeur that feels at odds with what has come before.
I do not regret my time with A New Frontier, but the emotional core at the center of the series seems rotten. There are seeds of greatness here, but A New Frontier never gave them the necessary time to grow. The Walking Dead started as a story about people. It was about a convict looking to redeem himself and a child growing up in an unfair world. A New Frontier chases after these figures but no matter how hard it runs, it always remains firmly in their shadows.",,Kotaku,Ign,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document from IGN:

**The Walking Dead: A New Frontier Review**

This review details everything you need to know about Telltale's latest installment in their narrative game franchise, The Walking Dead: A New Frontier.

**A Series of Contradictions**

A New Frontier is a series defined by contradictions. On one hand, it boasts interesting characters that fail to resonate with the player. On the other hand, it's painfully human yet insufferably cliché. The season is ambitious in scope but underwhelming in execution, stumbling far more often than it succeeds.

**The Story**

A New Frontier follows Javier García, a former baseball player turned survivor, as he navigates the outbreak of a zombie plague with his sister-in-law Kate and her two children, Gabe and Mariana. What starts as a simple tale of survival builds into a story with major repercussions for other characters and entire settlements. This season marks the largest scale the series has ever seen.

**Early Successes**

The first two episodes, ""Ties That Bind, Parts One and Two,"" expertly balance the growing scope with the series' concern for individual people and their problems. They jump between past and present, showcasing Javier's life before the outbreak and focusing on his relationship with his parents and temperamental brother David. In the present, they introduce a strong central conflict with the militant regime called the New Frontier, which is consolidating power over the wasteland in the name of maintaining order.

**Failed Promises**

However, A New Frontier fails to capture the emotional depth of the first season and retains none of the second season's compelling character beats. Season Two was a deeply personal story focused on character development, whereas A New Frontier moves from set piece to set piece without giving players much opportunity to learn to care about the characters.

**Technical Issues**

Telltale's technology has not aged well, with character animations remaining stiff and animatronic. Vaguely worded dialog choices fail to properly indicate tone, creating moments of unintentional comedy that undercut the dramatic tension. The backend systems also faltered, with many decisions not properly carrying over from episode to episode.

**A Mixed Bag**

A New Frontier is a roller coaster ride of successes met with equal or greater failures. It takes time to define the world in stark detail, aiming to expand the series' scope to something as deeply concerned with society at large as it is with individual morality. It crafts memorable characters with clear struggles, but later abandons the interesting set up in favor of bombast and grandeur that feels at odds with what has come before.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, The Walking Dead: A New Frontier is a series that has lost its emotional core. While it takes time to craft memorable characters and defines the world in stark detail, it ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the personal conflicts it sets up. Despite its successes, A New Frontier remains in the shadows of its predecessors.","Here is the rewritten document:

The Walking Dead: A New Frontier is an enigmatic series marked by contradictions. The third season of Telltale's narrative-driven game franchise, which concludes with the release of the final episode ""From The Gallows,"" is replete with intriguing characters that fail to resonate with the player. It's a deeply human and distressingly clichéd tale, imbued with lofty ambitions that often stumble and falter.

A New Frontier follows the narrative of Javier García, a former baseball player turned survivor, as he navigates a treacherous world overrun by zombies. His primary concern is protecting his sister-in-law Kate, her two children, Gabe and Mariana, and eventually, himself. What begins as a simple tale of survival soon escalates into a story with far-reaching implications for the characters and entire settlements. This season boasts the largest scope of the series to date, an attribute that's both captivating and overwhelming.

The first two episodes, ""Ties That Bind, Parts One and Two,"" expertly balance the growing narrative scope with the series' emphasis on individual characters and their struggles. The storyline seamlessly weaves together Javier's past and present, exploring his relationships with his parents and brother David, while introducing a central conflict in the form of the New Frontier, a militant regime vying for power in the devastated world. These two threads converge when the New Frontier's rise to power becomes personal for Javier.

A New Frontier attempts to craft a narrative that explores the pressures of leadership on both micro and macro levels. The game raises questions about the kind of father Javier can be to his nephew Gabe, whether he can reconcile with his brother David, and whether he'll rise above his baser instincts to become a true leader or succumb to the necessary violence required to survive. Unfortunately, the series struggles to meaningfully address these questions.

One significant issue is the role of fan favorite character Clementine. Her presence feelslike a nod to the past, rather than a vital component of A New Frontier. Her minimal impact on the plot distracts from Javier's narrative, making it seem like the series is clinging to past glories rather than forging a new path.

A New Frontier's inability to capture the emotional depth of the first season and the character-driven storytelling of the second season is a disappointing misstep. The series moves from set piece to set piece without giving players sufficient opportunity to connect with the characters. This oversight hobbles the narrative, preventing the core cast from truly coming alive.

Moreover, Telltale's technology has not aged well. While the visual style has become more confident, character animations still feel stilted and puppet-like. The poor camera editing and vague dialogue choices often lead to unintentional comedy, detracting from the dramatic tension of the scenarios.

Lastly, Telltale's backend systems sometimes faltered, causing decisions to not carry over from episode to episode, nor did choices from previous seasons make it into the initial parts of A New Frontier. These issues detracted from an otherwise engaging experience.

A New Frontier is a series marked by equal parts success and failure. It takes bold strides in expanding the scope of the series, crafting memorable characters, and emphasizing interpersonal dynamics. However, it ultimately falters, prioritizing grandeur over emotional resonance. While I don't regret my time with A New Frontier, the series' core feels unfulfilled, leaving me wondering what could have been. The Walking Dead started as a story about people; it's a shame A New Frontier lost sight of that.","Here is the rewritten source document in the style of the reference document:

1.0,"Valkyria Revolution tells a decent tale of war, but the strength of that story is dulled by overlong, boring, and poorly animated cutscenes. It sacrifices the unique historical setting and art style of the Valkyria Chronicles series proper in favor of generic JRPG elements that fail to leave a strong impression, and its hack-and-slash combat offers little in the way of strategy and ruins its own flow with an poorly matched magic system.","AtAt times, playing Valkyria Revolution is like being dragged face-down through the shattered, jagged remnants of something that was once whole and good.
Valkyria Revolution is the fourth installment in Sega’s Valkyria series, but it’s also a clean break of sorts. Unlike 2008’s Valkyria Chronicles and its sequels, Revolution is well removed from the memorable fantasy-meets-WWII setting.
In general, a lot of what made its predecessors so endearing is absent in Revolution, and what remains doesn’t do the game any favors. Systems better suited to a strategy-heavy game feel shoehorned in, and where character interaction and meaningful storytelling once held their seat at the table, Revolution has little more than an empty chair.
About a hundred years before the events of the first Valkyria game (and on the other side of the continent of Europa) a small country named Jutland is preparing for a revolution. They’ve been struggling with an economic blockade enacted by the Ruzi Empire which dominates the lands to the north. The blockade has forced Jutland into an economic tailspin, and so in order to reclaim their place in Europa they embark on a campaign to push back the Ruzi border and liberate the Ruzi-occupied nations in their path. At the forefront of this war are an elite group of soldiers known as the Vanargand and a cohort of five famous traitors pulling strings behind the scenes.
Although the Valkyria series is known primarily for its strategy elements, Valkyria Revolution is an action RPG through and through. The bulk of nearly any fight is spent running after things and hitting the X button to strike them with mana-charged melee weapons while occasionally employing elemental Ragnite spells, guns or grenades as needed. If this sounds repetitive, it is — and even moreso when done on the same handful of maps with the same handful of objectives, all endlessly repeating in between the story missions which are also generally set on the same handful of maps.
The vestiges of classic Valkyria strategy remain here and there, but for the most part they don’t carry much weight. If anything, they just get in the way. The Action Gauge is there to force a  stop-and-start rhythm reminiscent of turn-based combat — except Valkyria Revolution’s combat isn’t really turn based. Characters can move freely as they would in any other action RPG, so their timed access to attacks and abilities ends up feeling more like neverending series of hiccups than any kind of rhythm or flow.
This isn’t the only reason combat feels terrible in this game, though. Fighting an airborne boss when you can only aim ranged attacks at about a sixty degree angle overhead doesn’t feel great either. Players can command other characters in their party, but it’s almost invariably faster and more effective just to swap to controlling that character to complete the desired action. There’s cover and the absolute vaguest sort of stealth mechanics, but the controls to take advantage of them are fickle. The same button will crouch you behind something as will vault you over it, but the contextual actions that change which one will occur are somehow both finicky and unresponsive. I don’t love coming to nearly a dead stop ahead of a piece of cover only to soar over it, or watching my character run in place up against the low barrier blocking a narrow path while I’m mashing R1 and getting shot at.
The only strategic aspect that doesn’t fall apart under scrutiny are each characters’ Potentials. These are essentially buffs and debuffs that trigger under different circumstances. Some characters perform better when they’re fighting solo, while others perform best when paired off. Some have allergies that affect their skills in grassy areas, while others have natural aptitudes for guns or magic worth taking advantage of. Potentials can evolve as more side-stories and social circles are unlocked, and are particularly useful when paired with the many tactics that can be slotted in to define a character’s priorities when the AI is at the helm.
But frankly there are a lot of things about Valkyria Revolution that fall apart under closer scrutiny, and even its most beautiful and cohesive portions quickly wear out their welcome.
Valkyria Revolution’s story itself is told within the frame of a teacher and student discussing the largely unknown truth behind Jutland’s revolution a century after it takes place. Sunlight streams through trees, moss and ivy cover somber headstones with shocks of life. Leather bound books sit open in laps with passages underlined and notes scrawled in margins. The presentation in these sections is immediately and powerfully gorgeous.
The problem is that Valkyria Revolution drags the player back out into this frame constantly, and often for no clear reason. More than once I would turn back to the teacher and have her continue her story, just long enough to watch two cutscenes in the war-torn past before I was bumped back out to the peaceful forest glade again. Nothing new had been unlocked, and the only option to progress was to ask the teacher once again to continue, to drop once again into the past, to once again watch a string of cutscenes.
And there are a lot of cutscenes. And loads between those cutscenes,. And loads in the middle of those cutscenes. These were not short loads. It felt like most of my time with Valkyria Revolution was spent watching either cutscenes or the little loading icon pulsing in the lower right corner.
Had it been loading anything good I might not have minded.
On a purely technical level, Valkyria Revolution’s more cinematic moments look and feel awful. Oddly harsh cuts and framing as well as poorly timed dialogue and animation cues give many of its cutscenes a patched-together, amateurish quality. Characters move rigidly and wield weapons weightlessly in these scenes, and their faces animate and emote with all the detail and complexity of a cheap puppet.
At least puppets have giant mouths or move their bodies while they talk, making them easy to follow. In Valkyria Revolution, mouths are so small and animation so minimal that in larger group scenes or moments where individuals aren’t facing the camera it can be hard to follow who’s actually talking. It’s just a table full of dolls frozen and staring at each other while a disembodied voice assures the room and the player that war is totally bad, for real.
Which brings me to this: The subpar animation, the loading, the deeply awkward implementation of its narrative frame — I could look past it all if Valkyria Revolution’s story wasn’t told so shallowly.
Every character in this game loves to talk about how war is bad. They love to talk about how people suffer. But none of this ever amounts to a compelling emotional dilemma. There aren’t any tough calls. We’re introduced to the Vanargand as they discuss an old woman who died because an economic blockade had kept her from getting the medicine she needed. The game’s brooding blank slate of a lead, Amleth, is one of a group of orphans whose orphanage was burned down by the enemy emperor. The story constantly tries to present the idea that the war is unfounded, but then thoroughly and decisively founds it at every turn. It tries to pin scandal on those who push for conflict, but only ever paints them as tragic heroes and their enemies as blackhearted and evil scum. This story is told as if there is a real subtlety or internal conflict within Valkyria Revolution, but there isn’t. The same tired lines repeat over and over.
And on those exceedingly rare occasions when it does finally nod to any tangible consequences, Valkyria Revolution undermines them immediately. Upon reading a particularly tragic newspaper headline (the details of which I won’t spoil, but suffice it to say it’s incredibly significant to the story) Amleth exclaims “Nice” just the same as he does after reading a positive one.
The gruesome personal cost of war: Nice.
None of this is helped by the fact that Amleth himself is the equivalent of a tennis ball on a stick — a nondescript focal point for other slightly more interesting, slightly more developed characters to interact with.
Putting aside the lackadaisical handling of its largest theme, Valkyria Revolution’s smaller moments are about as uninspiring as it gets. In most scenes the party characters are written less like a squad of soldiers who work closely together and more like a list of checkboxes with a line quota to reach. Everyone has to say their piece, everyone has to take their turn, even if what they’re saying is the absolute definition of filler. The more intimate interactions meant to showcase the characters and their relationships in particular feel far less forced, but every single one of them goes on about twice as long as it should, sucking a lot of the energy and character developing “oomph” out by the time they finally fade out.
As if to salt that specific wound, none of the dialogue in the game’s cutscenes can be buttoned through. The only choices are to skip the entire thing or savor every poorly directed second of it.
The true misery of Valkyria Revolution is how much of the series’ roots show through, and how much Revolution itself doesn’t know what to do with them. The qualities that defined earlier Valkyria games are mostly vestigial, but Revolution doesn't present anything strong enough or distinct enough to replace them. What it does do often directly conflicts with those legacy bulletpoints, making a game that feels like a bland timesink at its best and a fractured mess at its worst.

Valkyria Revolution's storyline is passable, but its impact is dulled by the presence of prolonged, monotonous, and poorly animated cutscenes. The game's unique historical setting and art style, reminiscent of the Valkyria Chronicles series, are overshadowed by generic JRPG elements that fail to leave a lasting impression. Furthermore, the hack-and-slash combat mechanics lack strategic depth and are disrupted by a poorly integrated magic system.

Unlike the fluid experience of other JRPGs, Valkyria Revolution's narrative struggles to maintain its pace, weighed down by an abundance of unengaging cutscenes. The game's setting, which initially showed promise, ultimately succumbs to the limitations of its JRPG framework, neglecting the rich historical context that defined the Valkyria Chronicles series. Similarly, the combat mechanics, though initially entertaining, fail to deliver a fulfilling experience due to the awkward implementation of magical abilities.

In conclusion, Valkyria Revolution's inability to balance its narrative, setting, and combat mechanics results in a subpar JRPG experience that fails to live up to the standards set by its predecessors.","Valkyria Revolution: A Battle of War and Frustration

Valkyria Revolution is a game of contrasts, where the developers' ambitious vision of a war-torn world is marred by poorly executed mechanics and frustrating gameplay. The story, though well-intentioned, is bogged down by lengthy and poorly animated cutscenes that sap the player's enthusiasm. 

The game's unique historical setting and art style, which were so distinct in the Valkyria Chronicles series, are instead replaced with generic JRPG elements that fail to impress. The hack-and-slash combat, initially promising, quickly becomes repetitive and shallow, with an ill-conceived magic system that disrupts the flow of battle.

The Valkyria Revolution's biggest misstep, however, is its inability to balance gameplay and story. The game's cutscenes, while visually striking, are far too long and poorly paced, making it difficult to stay invested in the narrative. The combat, while initially enjoyable, becomes a grind, with the magic system throwing off the rhythm of battle.

In a game where strategy and tactics are essential, the magic system's introduction feels like a misstep, creating an uneven playing field that frustratingly disrupts the flow of combat. The result is a game that, despite its ambition, ultimately falls flat, leaving players frustrated and underwhelmed.

Overall, Valkyria Revolution's shortcomings are a disappointment, especially given the potential of its premise. With a more focused approach to gameplay and storytelling, this could have been a standout title. Instead, it's a frustrating experience that fails to deliver on its promises.","Here is the rewritten source document in the style of the reference document from Polygon:

**Valkyria Revolution Review**

Our Valkyria Revolution review shows you how to navigate the game's story, combat, and art style. We'll also direct you to the key issues that detract from the overall experience.

**The Story of War**

Valkyria Revolution tells a decent tale of war, but it's dulled by overlong, boring, and poorly animated cutscenes. The game sacrifices the unique historical setting and art style of the Valkyria Chronicles series proper in favor of generic JRPG elements that fail to leave a strong impression.

**Combat and Strategy**

The hack-and-slash combat offers little in the way of strategy and ruins its own flow with a poorly matched magic system. The game's combat mechanics are straightforward, but the magic system disrupts the flow, making it feel disjointed.

**Art Style and Setting**

The game's art style is generic and lacks the unique historical setting of the Valkyria Chronicles series. The JRPG elements feel out of place, and the game's overall aesthetic suffers as a result.

**Conclusion**

Valkyria Revolution's story is decent, but it's marred by poor cutscenes, generic JRPG elements, and a lackluster art style. The combat is straightforward but disrupted by the magic system, making it feel disjointed. Overall, the game fails to leave a strong impression.

1.0,,"For every answer Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker delivered while wrapping up the Skywalker Saga, it raised another question. The murky plot became a critical hang-up during the December 2019 release, but it may have been the best sales pitch for Rae Carson’s Episode 9 novelization, due on March 17. In the wake of The Rise of Skywalker, fans have been antsy to learn how the novelization would shed light on some of the underdeveloped aspects of the story.
While the novel isn’t out yet, a few key passages have already crept online. It’s tempting to call these leaks, but that isn’t necessarily accurate: copies of the book were sold early to attendees of C2E2. Snapshots of passages would inevitably go viral.
These early excerpts suggest there are a few things that Carson’s book makes clear — and in some cases more confusing. So with the book still a few days away from release, here are the biggest things that we’ve learned about Star Wars canon thanks to the The Rise of Skywalker novelization.
The version of Palpatine we see in The Rise of Skywalker is just a clone of the earlier former emperor. This might be the least surprising, but most important reveal in the novel, at least from the early excerpts. Cloning is a well established part of the Star Wars canon at this point: There were entire clone wars, there was an attack involving many clones, and there have even been a few hints that cloners are interested in Baby Yoda on The Mandalorian. We also know that Palpatine embraced cloning to grow Snoke bodies.
It is a little weird that he was able to ... possess a clone with his spirit, and it’s not totally clear why he wouldn’t pick a better body to possess. A clone Rey seems a bit stronger than a clone Palpatine (but less recognizable, perhaps). Either way, we know that the Palpatine we see in Rise of Skywalker is the spirit of the character seen in Return of the Jedi now in a clone body. Palpatine clones were something that Star Wars Legends canon used frequently, but not something J.J. Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio said out loud in the script.
This opens up a few possibilities with more cloning-centric plots in future Star Wars stories, but it also leaves the door open, at least a little, for Palpatine to return — yet again.
Speaking of Palpatine clones, apparently that’s exactly who Rey’s dad really was. In his quest to make a perfect clone, Palpatine ended up with dozens of rejects. One of the clones, while functional, showed no force aptitude at all, making it a disappointment. But Palpatine allowed the clone to survive so that it could carry on the Palpatine bloodline. That clone was Rey’s dad.
Now, this idea seems to go against the actual plot of the Rise of Skywalker film, in which we’re told that it was by choice that Rey’s parents fled Palpatine. In fact, that was supposed to be the entire reason we knew they were good people. We don’t count “they sold you to protect you” as a redeeming quality here, sorry.
It’s also curious that Palpatine’s clone, who didn’t have force powers, would go on to have a child that does have the force. Cloning force users can be extremely difficult, so Rey’s dad losing the force that the original Palpatine had isn’t too surprising. If the midi-chlorians didn’t survive the clone process then  why would it reignite a generation later with Rey? And if the midi-chlorians did survive the cloning process and Rey’s dad had them the whole time, then really wasn’t the lack of force powers mostly a fault of Palpatine’s training? This is where bits of a novel may not sell the entire new(ish) concept.
The strangest reveal of the Rise of Skywalker novelization sheds a little more light on the kiss that Rey and Ben shared at the end of the film. In the film version, after Ben uses all his strength to heal Rey, they share a kiss in the brief moment they’re both alive. The same basic events happen in the novel, but apparently it clarifies that the kiss was not, in fact, romantic.
It’s not really clear what the intention here is, but it definitely feels unnecessarily mean to the Reylos. Ben’s already dead, after all. Sorry, Reylos.
This isn’t exactly news, but the novel did make this canon. In the Rise of Skywalker movie, Finn spends the entire film trying to tell Rey a secret, but he never does. We found out after the movie, thanks to various interviews, that Finn wanted to tell her that he’s Force sensitive. In the novel that’s made a little bit more explicit ... but not by much.
Unfortunately, don’t hold your breath for a Disney Plus series to flesh out Finn’s arc in the future. “You ain’t going to Disney Plus me!” John Boyega told Variety after being pitched the possibility.
This doesn’t tell us much about the story, but it is a nice conclusion to Rey’s thematic arc. After she tells the nosey old woman on Tatooine that her new name is Rey Skywalker, Rey turns to leave, but pauses just long enough to watch Tatooine’s twin suns. In the movie this parallels the moment in A New Hope when Luke himself turns and watches the two suns set. But, thanks to the novel, we know that these suns are actually rising on a new day. So that’s nice.",Ign,Polygon,"Here is the rewritten document in the style of the reference document:

Xbox One's revamped controller boasts two new additions: the ""Menu"" and ""View"" buttons, which supplant the Start and Back buttons of its Xbox 360 predecessor. According to a Microsoft representative, these innovative buttons bring a slew of new functionality to the table.

The Menu button, situated on the right, serves as a gateway to context-specific menus, carefully crafted by game and app developers to elevate the user experience. In practice, this could mean bringing up in-game menus, providing video playback options, or accessing commands on the console's user interface. ""The Menu button is all about providing users with the tools they need, when they need them,"" Microsoft explained to IGN.

Meanwhile, the View button's functionality is more malleable, its purpose shifting depending on how developers choose to harness its potential. At its core, the View button is designed to provide users with additional information on apps or gameplay. Potential applications of the View button include perusing a map during a role-playing game, displaying a leaderboard in a first-person shooter, or even streamlining navigation of the console's user interface.

The Xbox One was officially unveiled during Microsoft's event last week, and it's worth noting that the new system will not support Xbox 360 controllers.

Get ready to dive back into the world of Saga, the heart-wrenching and operatic space epic from writer Brian K. Vaughan and artist Fiona Staples. After a lengthy hiatus, the series is finally set to return to publication in 2022, with a brand-new chapter that promises to be just as twist-filled and sexy as its predecessors.

To mark the occasion, Image Comics has shared a first look at Saga #55, which will hit shelves on January 26, 2022. This extra-long issue clocks in at 44 pages, but won't cost you a penny more than usual. The cover features a familiar face – Hazel, the book's narrator – alongside two new adult characters.

But before we dive back into the world of Saga, let's take a detour into the world of Resident Evil 3. Specifically, we're heading to Umbrella's NEST 2 facility, where Jill and Tyrell will face off against all manner of horrors. In this guide, we'll walk you through the area, pointing out any items or collectibles along the way.

First, follow Tyrell through the door out of the Surveillance Room, and watch the cutscenes. Then, head through the Sterilization Room, grabbing the High-Grade Gunpowder from the shelves by the door, and the Green Herb and NEST 2 Employee Regulations from the right-hand side. Be sure to hit the Item Box and Typewriter while you're here.

From Storage, head out the door, take an immediate left, and go up the stairs. At the top, take the first left, deal with the zombie, and follow the hall around to the left. Take out the next zombie, and pick up the Shotgun Shells and Isaac Graves' Diary. Then, head back to the hall and go north.

Use the terminal in the northeast corner to pick up the Override Key, and step through the door to the north onto the balcony. Look in the shadow to your left (west) for a Charlie Doll. Go back down the stairs and turn left, using the Override Key on the door along the left wall. Handle the zombies, and then read the Shipping Notice near the stairs.

Climb the stairs and go into Lab 1, taking out the zombie that stands up. Use the machine to collect the Antigen Sample, and read the Weaponry Authorization Request on the counter. Pick up the Gunpowder, and duck into the attached room at the back to grab some Handgun Ammo. Check the floor next to the large, white crates for a Charlie Doll.

Go back down to the shipping room with the ziplocked zombies, zigzagging through the hanging bags to the back of the room, dealing with any Pale Heads that show up. Pick up the Green Herb on the left, and the Shotgun Shells on the right. Go through the door, and turn right, reading the Scientist's Dying Message.

Turn around and take the first right, opening the case for some Acid Rounds for your Grenade Launcher. Head to the southwest corner for a Red Herb, and continue along the wall for some Gunpowder. Go down the stairs and around to the left, dealing with the zombie, and then opening the case on the far side of the room for a First Aid Spray.

Push the giant canister-thing to unlock the door at the bottom of the stairs, and go open it. Follow the walkway to the elevator, and ride it up. Inside the Incubation Lab, deal with the zombie on your left, and read the Expression of Concern on the desk. Check the drawer in the wall for the Adjuvant Sample.

Open the case at the back of the room for some Explosive A, and pick up the Gunpowder by the tubes. Start retracing your steps to head back to Storage and then up to 2F. Four Hunters Beta will jump out of the tubes in that B1 walkway – the Shotgun works well here, or you can fire off your Grenade Launcher.

Continue around to Storage to save and rearrange your inventory. Go upstairs and back into the room with the Vaccine Equipment. In your inventory, combine the Antigen and Adjuvant Samples to create a Vaccine Base. Insert that into the Vaccine Equipment, and set the gauges to MID, HIGH, and LOW from left to right. Pick up the Vaccine.

After Nemesis shows up again, run forward, and go through the vent to the Machinery Room. Follow the prompt to reach the elevator, and ride the lift up to the Workers' Break Room in the Disposal Center. Turn left, and smash the crate for some Explosive B. Pick up the High-Grade Gunpowder and First Aid Spray, and read the Disposal Center note by the door. Over by the Item Box, grab the Flame and Explosive Rounds.

But enough about Resident Evil – let's talk about The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. One of the biggest mysteries in this game is how to make rupees fast and reliably. Thankfully, the Breath of the Wild community has discovered an easy technique that involves bowling. Yes, you read that right – bowling.

To give it a try, head up to Pondo's Lodge, located next to the Hebra Tower in northwest Hyrule. Make sure you have the Pro HUD turned off and the Sheikah Slate sensor turned on, and that you're rocking at least two pieces of cold resistance gear. Once you've made it to the lodge, get into a very specific position – stand at the top of the hill, with your right leg on a rock, and your right leg slightly bent.

Then, move the camera so the Sheikah Slate sensor is covering the moose statue's right eye. Once it's lined up, slowly move your left stick forward until Link repositions himself forward. Once realigned, tap the R button, and Link should roll the snowball downhill. If done correctly, you'll net 300 rupees for a strike. If you do miss, you can get a spare and get 100 rupees. Keep in mind that each try costs 20 rupees, but the net return is still good for the time invested.

1.0,"There are two ways Zelda games can be great. The newest entry in the series, The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks summits one of those rarefied heights.
There are the Zelda games that are great in ways that influence an industry and nearly mandate that they be played. These groundbreakers include the very first Zelda and The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, both of which have, as a whole or in parts, inspired dozens of games and probably hundreds of developers.
Then there the Zelda games that are great at being Zelda games, achieving a less widely-appreciated magnificence, but one that plays to the fans. These Zelda games — A Link To The Past, Majora's Mask — excel at making enjoyable a clockwork complexity of characters, puzzles, music, locomotion, exploration, locked-room-mysteries, and hours-incubating-eurekas — a combination of design elements that may be the road hardest taken in video game franchise development. And it's in this latter category that Spirit Tracks, the third in the cartoon-Link series, the second on the DS and the first to put Link on a train with Zelda adventuring at his side, excels like the best of them.
Loved The New World: The map of Link's latest land in need of saving doesn't look all that different from the terrain earlier Links have tread before. There's snowy sections and mountains, beaches, forest and the rest of standards. Well, you can't judge a world by its topsoil. This is a world stuffed with interesting towns that contain interesting characters, more than the standard I-lost-my-chickens Zelda townsfolk but instead people with semi-real problems — think the love woes of Majora's Mask, for example — and good senses of humor. It's not just the people but the places. This is a world so full of diversions, many of them as well-hidden as anything put in a Zelda since the first entry in the series, that the optional wandering you do could probably account for half the game. And what you'll find for it is as surprising as, well, make sure, for example, that you find the pirate hide-out and therefore the best prison-break mini-game of the year. Discovery is possible in ways big and small. The relatively barren overworld of the Wii's Zelda, Twilight Princess, is not back.
Train Vs. Horse Vs. Boat: The boat and the horse, previous Zelda games' means of conveyance were great go-anywhere devices. For the first several hours of Spirit Tracks the train will feel like nothing but an inferiority. Then, surprisingly late in the game, the designers begin to celebrate what trains can do well — aside from stay on their tracks, avoid other trains and shoot cannons at boars. What trains do well is carry stuff and people and serve more uses than one. Eventually you're swapping train car types (I went with the skull-shaped engine), carrying ice or lumber or whatever was requested, ferrying passengers, watching out for bandits and pirates that might upset your animate and inanimate cargo, hitting warp gates and engineering like a pro. A few journeys in the game will feel long, but if you smartly multi-task a lot, then there's a lot of fun to running this train.
Amelie, The Game: One of the finest parts of a Zelda game I've ever played was a level in the little-discussed Four Swords four-player game made for the GameCube. Unusual in that it was multiplayer and broken into levels, it was also odd for having a level in which our hero(es) Link killed no one and nothing. This was a town level that took all of the item-trading and occasional favor-doing that Zelda players had done in previous games and dared to offer a satisfying level composed just of that. Spirit Tracks can, for hours on end, be played in just that way, with Link doing favors for people all around the game's expansive world. Technically these may be fetch quests — bring that ice from snow town to ocean town to chill the lady's fish and bring the kid to the castle town because he desires an adventure. But it's the writing and the clever construction of these quests — plus the ability to stack them by loading your train with supplies and a passenger related to two separate quests — that make this unadvertised element of Spirit Tracks possibly the best thing about the game. The traditionally single-species towns of Zelda games become integrated thanks to your efforts, odd constructions are built thanks to your supplies, and most magically, making people happy, generates new train tracks that lead to surprising hidden destinations. I've never had so much fun being nice in a video game.
The Music: The music the game plays for you — headphones are a must — is magical, diverse and superb, but it surpassed by the game's playable instrument, a pan flute that rivals Ocarina of Time's Ocarina for best interactive instrument. A combination of stylus-pressing and blowing on the DS mic closely mimics the physicality of playing a wind instrument in real life. It feels good (even though it looks a little goofy to bystanders on the subway, I'm sure!).
Her Majesty: The inclusion of Zelda as a partner character for the duration of the game is no mere marketing gimmick. Zelda's companionship makes the well-told story more interesting because her feisty personality enlivens moments that would normally only see the presence of Mr. No Personality, Link. In gameplay she's better, elaborating on the teases of single-player/two-character control that have been dabbled with by Zelda designers since at least the GameCube's Wind Waker. There are moments when the game asks of the player the dexterity of someone who can fight one enemy with two characters, controlling both with a mix of stylus swipes, taps and line-drawing (to denote Zelda's path of attack). No video game has asked for these kinds of hand gymnastics since Square-Enix's The World Ends With You. But this game builds to that complexity with skillful purpose and pacing. The learned ability — the rare instance of a Zelda game asking the player to improve his or her own skills rather than just rely on Link's game-long improvement of his own — is great reward. Why, I can control Zelda, who is pretty much only playable when she is possessing a suit of armor, so well that I can make her do the notorious series-cliche block-pushing puzzles for me by just drawing a few paths for her. That's terrific.
The Dungeons: Words fail in describing the complexity of a Zelda dungeon. But you know a well-designed one when you play one. Those are the only kinds of Zelda dungeons in this game, which includes a handful of main ones, a central one for the Link-Zelda play that is re-visited (without the annoyance of needing to be re-played) throughout the game and many other places that, buried in narrative are essentially mini-dungeons of their own. There are many puzzles, several items and a lot of clever solutions.
Visuals: The game looks better than its DS predecessor, The Phantom Hourglass, probably mostly thanks to rich art design. There is some annoying pop-in that makes it hard to see certain objects ahead of you while you're on the train, but that limitation is compensated for by a top-screen map that has all the info you need. For better or worse, some of the game can even be played with just your eyes on the top-screen map, but it's so tempting to look at the bottom screen because this is, maybe one of five best-looking DS games ever made?
Hated Lost Princess: There are some technological drawbacks, though. The game's most ambitious dungeons, full of moving characters, force framerate slowdowns than only add to panic when a cool head is needed. Worse, Zelda in her clunky armor does not always waddle over when you call her. Her path-finding in some dungeons has her walking the wrong way and/or into a wall instead of toward Link. Thankfully the player can always assume manual control to overcome this problem.
Bad Reflexes: There are some things done in Zelda games that must be in there only because That's How It Was Always Done. Why must every gem I remove from a treasure chest be accompanied by a message telling me how much it's worth? I get it. And why can't I return to this world after I finish this game? Thankfully a save prompt right before the final battle allows for a post-credits return by the player to the game in its 11th hour, when, I gather, it is still possible to do the generous amount of side-adventuring offered in the game.
Wind Breaker: The game's musical instrument requires the player to blow into the mic. That is the same mic that can pick up sounds. Woe to the person who tries to play the healing song and restore their nearly-dead Link to health during a boss battle while riding in a New York City subway car. The clatter of the real train fools the game into thinking notes are being played. These are the wrong notes. The song isn't played. Link isn't healed. He gets killed. If only there was an option for players in noisy environments. Or I'll just yell: ""Quiet everyone! I'm playing Zelda.""
I've not described the story or named the new items. I've not detailed a puzzle or described the game's allusions to Ocarina of Time. I've left a lot out because discovery is the fun of a Zelda game. In 2000, Majora's Mask won me over because it took a formula I knew and contorted it, gave extra verve to the types of characters who appear in the series and impressed me with the complex precision of its interactive machinery.
There is a way to play and not like The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks. The train might be dull for people who don't wait for the designers to get warmed up and who ignore the side quests. The dungeons may well be too hard for some of the DS's newest consumers. This game may not have the broadest of appeals, but if you like Zelda, this is upper-echelon stuff.

**The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks Review**

**Enter the World of Spirit Tracks**

This latest installment in the Zelda series reaches new heights, and we're not just talking about the train that Link and Zelda ride on.

**Two Types of Greatness**

Zelda games can be great in two ways. Some are groundbreaking and industry-influencing, like The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. Others excel at being fantastic Zelda games, with intricate design elements that delight fans. Spirit Tracks falls into the latter category, alongside A Link To The Past and Majora's Mask.

**Loved the World**

The map may seem familiar, but don't judge it by its surface. This world is packed with interesting towns, characters with real problems, and a sense of humor. You'll discover surprises big and small, like the pirate hideout and its prison-break mini-game.

**Train vs. Horse vs. Boat**

At first, the train may seem inferior to the horse and boat from previous games. But as you progress, you'll find that it has its own strengths, like carrying passengers and goods. You'll switch train car types, ferrying ice or lumber, watching out for bandits, and hitting warp gates.

**Amelie, The Game**

One of the finest parts of Spirit Tracks is its focus on helping others. You'll do favors for people all around the world, which may seem like fetch quests, but are cleverly constructed and rewarding. Your efforts will integrate the traditionally single-species towns, build odd constructions, and even generate new train tracks that lead to hidden destinations.

**The Music**

The music is magical, diverse, and superb, with the playable pan flute rivaling Ocarina of Time's Ocarina. The combination of stylus-pressing and blowing on the DS mic closely mimics real-life instrument playing.

**Her Majesty**

Zelda's inclusion as a partner character is no gimmick. Her feisty personality enlivens the story, and her gameplay elaborates on single-player/two-character control. You'll need to control both Link and Zelda with stylus swipes, taps, and line-drawing, requiring hand gymnastics.

**Dungeons and More**

The dungeons are complex and well-designed, with puzzles, items, and clever solutions. The game looks better than its DS predecessor, with rich art design, although there's some pop-in limitation compensated by a top-screen map.

**Some Drawbacks**

There are framerate slowdowns in ambitious dungeons and some path-finding issues with Zelda in her armor. Additionally, the game could improve in some areas, like removing the need for messages when collecting gems or allowing a return to the world after completion.

**Overall**

The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks is upper-echelon stuff, with discovery being the fun of the game. If you like Zelda, you'll love this. Developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS, it retails for $34.99 USD. We were given a copy for reviewing purposes.",,

1.0,"This side mission is available shortly after arriving on Aya.
Speak with Maariko, Aya's chief astronomer, near the docking bay, inside a small building to docking console's right. Maariko needs your help locating several missing satellites essential to monitoring the Scourge.
After speaking with Maariko, depart on the Tempest towards the first nav point located in the Onaon system. Scan the system until you find the anomaly (you may first encounter an anomaly that's just a mineral deposit, so it could be the second one), and approach. Unfortunately, there's nothing to find here.
Head to the second set of nav points just to the north in the Sabeng system. Scan the system there to find the same thing: Nothing. Third time's the charm.
Head to the third system further to the northwest, in the Joba system. Scan and probe as usual, and you'll find a comm buoy that the angaran adventurers left behind.

1.0,"The problem with the Ratchet & Clank games being consistently good, annual release after annual release, is that it's hard for them to seem spectacular. For the first time in a while, a new one does.
Since the Ratchet & Clank series launched just back in 2002, Insomniac Games has developed four installments for the PlayStation 2 and three — including the new entry, A Crack In Time, officially releasing this month — for the PlayStation 3. Another development studio has created a pair of PlayStation Portable games for the series as well.
That's a lot of Ratchet: A lot of a fuzzy hero jumping and shooting his absurd variety of weapons which become more powerful the more they connect with their hundreds of targets. That's a lot of Clank: A lot of a diminutive robot starring in side missions that usually feature a new and sequel-unique style gameplay. That's a lot of Captain Qwark, a lot of Dr. Nefarious. It's a lot of flying from planet to planet, collecting gold bolts to unlock alternate character models, jumping from floating platforms, shooting futuristic corridors, entering gladiator arena challenges, collecting comedy guns that make enemies dance, and unlocking post-credits challenge modes. Every time.
That's a lot of formula, and finally with A Crack In Time, the supposed conclusion to a three-part story on the PS3 that separated and now reunites the two title characters, there is enough new and enough changed to merit attention by those who may have grown weary. Ratchet is still flying to planets and doing his expected gun-slinging, but Clank's got his best new styles of gameplay yet. Plus, the mission flow, which brings Ratchet into contact with a mysterious other member of his supposedly lost species, finally gets the shake-up it's been needing.
Loved Clank Makes Me Smarter: Long ago, Clank stole the show in these games thanks to his fun character design and mischievous sense of humor. Now he's stolen it because of his gameplay as well. He starts the game and, between the breaks of Ratchet's inter-galactic adventures, learns an expanding set of moves that help him puzzle his way through a massive clockwork space station floating in the middle of the universe.
The core Clank gameplay involves time-manipulated 3D platforming. The player makes Clank run to a switch that should open a door. But as soon as they step off, the door shuts. The solution is to rewind time and let a recording of the player's Clank — now a color-coded ghost — run to that platform while the real Clank is made to run out the door. Eventually, Insomniac has the player saving and playing back four Clank ghosts and mixing in time-slowing bomb blasts to boot. These puzzle-room challenges are just involved and devious enough to require thought, and they are the most satisfying thing in the game to complete.
Ratchet Makes Me Hold My Breath: The core Ratchet gameplay is what series veterans would expect. You fly to planets, kill funny-looking aliens with an evolving toolset of absurd guns that includes a massive bowling ball of energy, a bomb-gun that has ordinance that detonates upward, a bundle of sticks that dig into the ground to network a web of tripwires and more conventional stuff like a pistol that shoots ricocheting lasers. The oldest of Ratchet ideas — the weapons level up into more powerful versions as you kill more enemies with them — are merged with more recent experiments with modular customization of some of the gun parts. You can imagine this and be on steady ground with your expectations. But once the game introduces two things — its moons and Ratchet's hover boots — something special happens.
Ratchet's planet visits are mostly conventional, fairly easy escapades. His visits to moons, however, are reminiscent of Mario's visits to the difficult no-hoverpack hidden stages in Super Mario Sunshine. The moons, which are presented as spherical levels — a design both the Ratchet and Mario games have used before — provide optional and tricky platforming challenges. These are the stages the more confident gamer will relish, especially once they are forced to activate Ratchet's hover-boots, which are essentially a stand-in for a futuristic skateboard, and precisely and quickly dash along platforms and off ramps that hover high over a magma moon's surface. Finally, physical movement in this series is tricky and exhilarating again. Mario shouldn't have all that fun.
Insomniac Makes Me Gape: More realistic-looking games tend to get the graphics awards, but the cartoon reality of A Crack In Time deserves commendation. As well as the game's heroes animate, its ordinary enemies animate even better. They clamber and dive and die dramatically with a visual flair one usually has to get from Looney Tunes. The game's environments are stunning, as a distant planet's rings peek over the horizon of the moon on which Ratchet stands … or in the clockwork complexity of Clank's domain … or amid the dense gray smoke puffs that emanate from the magnificent beast and rider who has just been toppled in front of his dozen lieutenants in a level that has the colorful richness of the deserts of the American southwest. This game looks great at every turn and is presented in a confident manner that masks little of its horizons and fills much of its scenes with visual variety and imagination.
The Story Makes Me Remember: The creeping problem with the Ratchet & Clank games is that it was all seeming the same. The series' many planets, guns and enemies began to blur together. Who could pick a favorite or remember any four of them distinctly? Insomniac, clearly trying to tell a more emotional story, albeit one that hits nothing more than the familiar beats about the value of friendship and sci-fi sanctity of time, has finally constructed a memorable mission flow. The game doesn't end when you think it might. It doesn't even progress in the standard planet-hopping manner of its predecessors. New twists and branches emerge as the player progresses, making it easy to tell the difference between the level that was the city, the one that was the arena and the one that pitted me in a battle near a waterfall to save a village. Those may sound like simple distinctions, but they are ones the series had been missing.
A Small Trick Makes Me Fix Things: It is not a big feature, but it is an example of how refreshing this game is. Clank has a scepter that, when he hits things that are broken, makes them come back together again. They animate their destruction in reverse. Reminiscent a little of Red Faction's repair gun, it is one of A Crack In Time's best visual tricks.
Hated Space Makes Me Sigh: I had high hopes for this game's outer-space sections. The game's mission planets and side-mission moons are contained in several space sectors. Ratchet can fly through each sector, landing on those heavenly bodies or taking side missions while staying in the seat of his craft. Those space tasks include blowing up asteroids, chasing comets and dogfighting enemy squadrons. None of it is challenging or all that fun. And it is not helped by attempted distractions like a quartet of available fake radio stations nor by an upgrade system that alters the lasers and missiles fired by Ratchet's ship. A future Ratchet game might improve the space stuff, but this iteration of it is a visually-attractive bore. At least a player sailing The Legend Of Zelda: Wind Waker's equally-beautiful but often equally-dull ocean had access to camera controls and could use their traveling time to frame the visuals in lovely ways.
Qwark Bums Me Out: Qwark's latest mini-game, My Blaster Runs Hot, continues the tradition of putting low-fi mini-games into high-def adventures. The joke's worn thin. I resisted the urge to play more than one round of his twin-stick shooter.
Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack In Time retains a lot of what was good about the previous games. But it also continues one of the best traditions of its developers — to compress past accomplishments, quickly give players a lot of the old stuff in the game's early going and then try new things. Earlier games' experiments with dialogue systems and multiplayer didn't thrill me. But, the new game's more dynamic physical movement (hooray for hoverboots), more interesting mission flow, amazing graphics and smart system of relatively easy main missions that branch off to more challenging moon challenges, are good innovations.
The Ratchet gameplay is improved. The Clank gameplay is a revelation. Two years ago, Ratchet & Clank Future showed how good Insomniac could make this series look on PS3. A year ago, Ratchet & Clank: A Quest For Booty showed that Insomniac was still prepared to innovate with gameplay. A Crack In time, the space case notwithstanding, finally shows the series leaping forward.","Being a huge fan of Tools of Destruction, I had a sneaking suspicion that I would love Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time. I was right.
Insomniac has created a visually appealing game with enough personality to match its good looks. With so much to level-up and enjoy, there's enough to keep even hardcore Ratchet fans coming back for more -- especially with the new Clank sections that feature some enthralling puzzles. Now that the awkward space sections from Tools of Destruction have been replaced, there's almost nothing I don't like about Crack in Time. Unfortunately, as Crack in Time still relies heavily on the tried and true Ratchet Formula, gamers that were satisfied with old Ratchet games might not have enough reasons to come back.
But how can anyone refuse that adorable, fuzzy Lombax? I sure can't. And he has such cool toys, to boot.",Kotaku,Ign,,,

1.0,"A funny thing happened after I beat Ruiner: I started having fun. My first playthrough was exhaustingly difficult. I don’t mind a challenge, but I also don’t want to feel like I’m banging my head against a wall for 10 hours, unsure of what I’m doing wrong. However, retreading the 14 levels of cyberpunk brutality as the fully powered-up version of my twin-stick killer finally let me enjoy the frantic, stylish combat.
The flow of gameplay is similarly straightforward: Walk down a corridor, get locked in a room of death, fight off several waves of enemies, die a bunch, eventually survive, and walk down the next corridor to the next room of death. Ruiner has more variables to it than something elegantly simple like Enter the Gungeon or Geometry Wars, but it starts you with a simple machine gun and a bat, and you’ll have to die many, many times before you earn the fun stuff and learn how to make use of it. Eventually, gadgets like time manipulators, defensive barriers, explosives, mind control, and more provide a nice variety of ways to kill and not be killed.
Fighting my way through Ruiner felt like work, and if I weren’t obligated to finish it for the review I probably wouldn’t have bothered. It’s too bad it focuses on being difficult over being fun, because the combat totally works when you’re given access to the full range of weaponry and gadgets and can finally stand up to the nearly endless waves of varied enemies thrown at you. This one is definitely better the second time around. Games should be fun right from when you hit the start button – that’s kind of the whole point – but Ruiner puts you through too much of a hazing ritual to get there.","RuinerRuiner asks a difficult question: Are you the ruiner or the ruined?
In the year 2091, everything is drenched in crimson — both blood and neon lights. In every corner of the desolate city swarms the broken, exploited, forgotten, tossed aside by Heaven, a megacorporation looking to score big off cheap labor — not unlike that of replicants from Blade Runner. Now more robotic than human, you are instructed to infiltrate and terminate Heaven by completing a simple task: KILL BOSS.
Developed by Reikon Games, a new studio comprised of former Dying Light and The Witcher devs, Ruiner places you behind the helmet of a nameless, robotic assassin affectionately called “Puppy” (and a host of other derogatory terms) whose goal is to eradicate Heaven. The bland narrative, punishing bosses, and inconsistent performance leave Ruiner a cyberpunk tale with lofty ambitions that’s blinded by its own neon lights.
Ruiner does an excellent job at world-building: From the cramped, overflowing city streets to the dilapidated, drug-infested alleyways, it’s apparent that a massive, corrupt corporation is strangling Rengkok, a retro-futuristic rendition of Bangkok evidently influenced by Blade Runner’s Los Angeles. However, the game’s writing is painfully, predictably cliché from the moment that the first boss utters a tired “They made me do it” line before being killed. Another boss touts the ever-expected “We aren’t that different, you and I” sentiment. Hell, even the final boss says some variation of “Let’s finish this, once and for all” and “I’ll show you true suffering.” With dialogue like this, Ruiner’s narrative lands in the territory of mediocre at best and forgettable at worst.
The game’s solid combat and smooth controls make up for the deficiency in its storytelling, though. Ruiner is an isometric, twin-stick shooter with a sprinkle of bullet-hell for added difficulty and stress, where commitment and precision are key to survival. Turning has a noticeable weight; you have to follow through with each action on your path to completing a goal. There’s no latency between button presses and character action, meaning the game will almost always respond in an accurate and timely manner. And since Ruiner can get rather difficult rather quickly, frame count and responsiveness can be the difference between retrying the level and an S+ rating. And S+ ratings net more karma.
Karma, Ruiner’s stand-in for experience points, is spent on leveling up Puppy as you traipse through the game’s 14 districts. Character leveling makes thematic sense here, as skills operate like mod installations, allowing you to swap mods and skill points on the fly and tailor the character’s feel to the situation. The idea of freely changing skills is novel — especially considering the cyberpunk theme — but some skills are far more practical and useful than others.
Take Ghost Break, the ability to hack enemies to fight for you, unlocked at level 11. On its surface, this sounds like a compelling skill that would make many of the boss fights a little less suffocating. In practice, however, it’s absolutely worthless, as hacking requires more time than the game allows in many scenarios. Ghost Break can eventually be upgraded to decrease hacking time, but by that time I had already put my skill points into the Dash, Resource Optimizer and Use Of Weapons mods, which were more practical and had tangible effects in  game. Couple this with the lackluster skill options further down the skill tree, and I found myself sticking to mods that increased my energy and health pools instead.
And you’ll be modifying Puppy frequently to better take on the incessant waves of enemies and bosses. Some bosses in Ruiner are (literally) electrifying, like TrafficKing, a hovering, severed head that requires you to shoot energy generators to short-circuit his hovercraft in order to deal damage while avoiding his bullet storm. Unfortunately, most other bosses are bullet sponges with screen-length health bars; bullet sponges that, more often than not, end up summoning more waves of enemies to help send you to the dog pound. These are frustrating, often multi-try bouts where challenge is immediately replaced by cheap difficulty and enemies with pixel-perfect accuracy. It becomes less about skill and more about luck, which left me exasperated when the boss quickly wrecked me time and time again.
One boss in particular, Mother, is excruciatingly frustrating, as she fires a powerful laser beam that ate through both my energy and health pools multiple times on the first encounter, killing me immediately. And she appears three times in Ruiner, meaning she drained my existence almost instantaneously multiple times throughout the game’s eight-hour runtime.
It’s in the chaotic, unending waves of enemies and the aggravating boss encounters where Ruiner’s performance begins to suffer. While the game runs smoothly the majority of the time, the frame rate tends to dip as the screen fills with special effects, drastically affecting your survivability. In one instance, the game froze temporarily, only to abruptly kill me. In another instance, the game inexplicably crashed, forcing me to reboot Steam altogether in order to restart. While the checkpoint system is forgiving enough, having to replay sections because of game performance is frustrating as hell.
By the time I fought Mother for the third and last time, I was prepared to throw my controller because of how quickly she evaporated my energy and health bars the first two times. Ruiner is one of those games that is unabashedly difficult for the sake of being difficult. It demands you face waves upon waves of the same enemies and mini-bosses before you can even see the final, incredibly trite cinematic. Are you the ruiner or the ruined? I won’t spoil the answer that the game offers up, but I will say that I sure didn’t feel triumphant when I finally set the controller down.

1.0,"David Cage, the writer/director for the upcoming Detroit: Become Human, is best in small doses. Given a single idea, the man famous for designing Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls knows how to pack a punch. Take, for example, the Heavy Rain DLC episode The Taxidermist. It’s an evocative, visceral experience, and not coincidentally, it’s also 20 minutes in length.
It’s difficult to think of another game designer who has tried so hard, for so many years, to not be a game designer. Cage is notorious for conflicting self-promotion. His press tour for Beyond: Two Souls was particularly bold: he argued that current games were not living up to their artistic potential and needed to be reinvented as a new form of entertainment. He criticized other designers’ games for rote, ‘by-the-numbers’ storytelling and mechanics. And he implored the industry who awarded him many Game of the Year awards to “grow up” and make themselves more accessible to a non-gaming audience.
There are many games—shooter games even, despite Cage’s disdain—that are emotionally resonant and daring, without getting upon stilts to proclaim themselves as such. The awkward truth in all of this is that Cage is not the best representative of his message. His ambition often outpaces his writing abilities, and he has a particularly difficult time with staging transitions. Heavy Rain has loose plot threads. Beyond: Two Souls has awkward tonal shifts; the game feels like a collection of short tales, held together by a single, common character.
But that is the best way to enjoy a David Cage game—as a series of small experiences, meant to be judged individually, rather than as a cohesive whole. Small moments in many of his games shine. There’s a memorable sequence in Beyond where Jodie goes to (and destroys) a teenage party, and another where she gets ready for a date. In Heavy Rain, Ethan cuts off his finger to save the life of his son in a visceral, compact scene.
Tonally, these sequences could not be more different. But what makes them work, especially when they are taken separately from their respective games, is their self-containment. They depict strong, singular emotions—nostalgia, anxiety, revulsion—while implicitly addressing larger themes of bullying, peer pressure, and the father/son bond.
The Taxidermist is similarly self-contained. It takes place chronologically before Heavy Rain, and players are cast as journalist Madison Paige. Madison is investigating a possible Origami Killer lead by visiting Leland White, a 40-year-old former taxidermist. He’s not home, so she crawls through the back window of his two-story home to snoop.
Quantic Dream’s art designers dressed the house’s interior perfectly. Everything on the lower level seems hazy with an inch of dirt and dust. I recently visited the Vanderbilt Museum on Long Island, which has an impressive taxidermy collection including a massive whale shark that’s suspended from the ceiling. Nobody has added to the collection in years, so the animals are starting to show their age. A crew of artists maintains it, but inevitably all the animals will become dust. It’s the same way that Leland White’s house feels—dirty from years of disuse and neglect, rather than from deliberate action.
You can go through all the drawers in Leland’s home. In the leftmost kitchen drawer, you find a magpie collection of women’s jewelry. In the fireplace, you find a scrap of burnt women’s clothing. You slowly get clues as to what’s going on, but there’s no explicit ‘smoking gun.’ Yet.
There are also small contextual details that characterize Leland himself. There’s a weightlifting machine, which implies that Leland is probably a strong man—relevant, since you’ll be overpowered should he return home.
In the main bedroom on the top floor, there’s a faded black and white photo of Leland’s mother when she was young. There’s a child’s room on the top floor (possibly Leland’s room as a child?), which contains a rack of women’s clothing. And then, in the bathroom, you find a grisly sight: a nude woman, dismembered and disemboweled in the bathtub.
At this point, Leland arrives home. The player has a couple of options. You can sneak to the phone and call the police, and then hide from Leland until they arrive. To hide, as in the main game, you don’t simply press the right combination of buttons; you have to hold all four buttons to continue hiding. This adds physical discomfort to what is already a tense situation.
If you don’t want to hide, you can try to sneak out of the house. But if you moved anything downstairs, or if you cause the floorboards to creak by walking too quickly, Leland will come after you with a knife. The main game also contains button sequences, that, if mistimed, would affect your story. But they were isolated events in a longer game; this DLC is more pervasively tense. Every moment matters—another benefit of a short run time. It’s the difference between a shot of adrenaline and a slow drip feed.
If you get caught, you can get killed (and presumably stuffed), and Leland White is never punished for his crimes. If you escape, the police will come to arrest Leland. But there are all sorts of permutations between these two extremes as well. If Leland discovers you but you still manage to escape, he’ll go back inside the house and kill himself. If he discovers you and you decide to fight back, you can disembowel him with a chainsaw. If you call the police and then get killed, he’ll be arrested, and you’ll be regarded as a martyr.
This open-endedness underlines The Taxidermist’s commitment to choice. The main Heavy Rain game must loop every segment, regardless of outcome, into a sprawling, contradictory story. Beyond: Two Souls contains even less variation, because Jodie cannot die. But The Taxidermist is unencumbered by this narrative bloat. Everything in the house works to characterize Leland instead of making some vague, overarching point. Every consequence has finality because of the game’s short run time and contained narrative.
Cage is in the spotlight again for the upcoming Detroit: Become Human. The game has already gotten a mixed response from critics who played the demo, many of whom found Cage’s central conceit of androids staging a revolt to be politically loaded and confusing. With the promise of a sprawling narrative and dynamic characters, it sounds like a typical David Cage creation. But Quantic Dream’s 2012 tech demo, “Kara,” which became a part of Detroit: Become Human, shows an emotional intimacy and focus that Detroit could have in its smaller moments, beyond the action-heavy set pieces we’ve seen thus far.
By constraining himself to a capsuled narrative with The Taxidermist, Cage showcased what he’s best at. Detroit has the same potential, even if the larger sci-fi narrative collapses under its own weight.
The Taxidermist was tasteless. It had no higher aspirations. But it was compact, efficient, and intense. And by aiming lower, the game hit its target.",,Kotaku,Ign,,,
1.0,"On June 10, Final Fantasy VII Remake, a game about wearing all the hottest styles out of the 2012 Paris Fashion Week, will land on PlayStation 5. Good news: You’ll be able to transfer your save data over from the PlayStation 4 version. Bad news: The process is, and you’ll never believe this, kind of a mess.
Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (that’s the very real mouthful of a name for the PS5 version) will offer all of the standard next-gen enhancements, including the ability to swap between graphical modes that prioritize either a higher framerate or a sharper resolution. The update itself is free for those who already own the game. Anyone who upgrades to Intergrade will also get the option to snag a bonus chapter starring Yuffie, a character from the 1997 original who was not present in Remake’s base game. That chapter isn’t free.
Last night, developer Square Enix pushed out an update for Final Fantasy VII Remake that allows for the data transference process. After you update your game, you should see an option in the starting menu to “upload your save data.” Though you have to upload your files piecemeal, you can upload as many as you like, which should be music to the ears of those who like to save scum. (Guilty as charged.) No one has access to Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade just yet, but it’s safe to assume the PS5 version has a similar option in the starting menu.
The issue with all this is, you have to keep Final Fantasy VII Remake, an 86 GB game, on your hard drive until you’ve completed the data transference process—which is to say, until you’ve also installed the Intergrade version too. It’s unclear how much space, exactly, Intergrade will occupy on your PS5’s internal storage.
This entire process mirrors a similar kerfuffle from earlier in the year, when players of Marvel’s Avengers tried to upgrade to the next-gen version. That more or less worked (or, uh, didn’t work) the same: To move your progress from the PS4 version to the PS5 version, you had to first boot up the PS4 game, navigate a series of in-game menus, boot up the PS5 version, and repeat the process in reverse.
In the past, I’ve derisively called Smart Delivery a “non-feature feature.” Twice. And, sure, even its most stalwart defenders have to admit that “Smart Delivery” sounds a whole lot like a term concocted in some late-Friday marketing meeting. But it’s proven to be a sleeper hit in terms of next-gen quality-of-life features. My colleague Ethan Gach put it best: Smart Delivery turned out to be a pretty big deal after all.

As part of its recently launched Summer at the Library program, NYPL is giving away 500,000 new librarian-approved books for families to keep. New Yorkers who wish to pick up a free good book can do so by visiting any NYPL branch and some select pop-up events and programs happening in parks around the city. Some of the branches distributing free books will also have texts in Spanish, Chinese, and large print available.
The initiative comes from NYPL's desire to help New Yorkers build their own library and to encourage citizens to read more. In addition to free books, NYPL's Summer in the Library will also include a series of free programs for both teens and adults across 92 locations. These events will focus on the love for reading and learning, and will help students fight the so-called ""summer slide"" and prevent them from forgetting their school-learned material.
The program will include activities and workshops like summer reading for kids and teens, reading recommendations put together by NYPL librarians, and even library initiatives for adults.
""New York City students and families have been through so much over the last two years. It's critical that, during this period of recovery and renewal, our ecosystem of learning do all it can to support and engage them,"" Brian Bannon, NYPL's Merryl and James Tisch director of branch libraries and education, said in a statement. ""Public libraries are uniquely positioned to do this while students are out of the classroom over the summer months, providing quality, free programs to engage their minds while also getting them excited about books, reading, learning, and their communities. After so much time apart, it's time to safely come together this summer.""
For a complete list of events and programs, you can visit this page on the NYPL website.","Here’s where you can pick them up.
The summer reading list is a long tradition and this year, it’ll be easier than ever to get it done.
New York City’s three library systems—Brooklyn Public Library (BPL), New York Public Library (NYPL) and Queens Public Library (QPL)—are partnering up with the New York Life Foundation to give away 15,000 books for free to New York families across the city.
Throughout the weekend, and while supplies last, young readers can pick up books (in English and Spanish, and Chinese in some locations) to keep and also sign up for library cards.
This giveaway is meant to support New Yorkers in need and includes locations near Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Centers or shelters.
This is the fifth year the New York Life Foundation has supported summer reading and learning programs for the libraries. According to the libraries, summer breaks without learning and reading can cause the average student to lose up to two months of instruction every year, and students from low-income families are, of course, more affected by this.",Thrillist,Timeout,,,
1.0,"KFC’s venerable founder and chameleon-like mascot Colonel Sanders has once again morphed into a new form — RoboCop. A new ad campaign features the dystopian zombie cyborg police officer, voiced by original 1980s RoboCop actor Peter Weller, defending the fried chicken chain’s secret blend of 11 herbs and spices in a nuclear bunker in Stockholm, Sweden.
In one spot, Colonel RoboCop offers a family one of KFC’s $20 Fill Ups meals and demands that they comply. In another, he attends a dinner party and deflects questions about the recipe with an “If I told you, then I’d have to kill you.” The awkward silence is broken by a mechanical laugh. In the final spot, RoboCop scans the city streets for all-white meat $5 Full Ups instead of criminals.
As usual, the KFC campaign is incredibly weird — it stars a chrome-plated cyborg donning the white-haired wig of the Colonel to urge people to eat fried chicken — and uncannily aware of the ways in which it’s manipulating nostalgia and a sense of satisfaction that remix culture often traffics in, of being in on the reference. But it’s all the weirder given that the original movie, a Christ allegory and one of the most blood-soaked movies of the 1980s, heavily satirized Reagan-era consumerism and brand tyranny in the form of OCP; KFC is part of Yum brands, which also owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, and was once part of PepsiCo, one of the largest food corporations in the world.
This is the latest in a long string of celebrities taking on the Colonel’s persona, including Reba McEntire, Jim Gaffigan, Rob Lowe, Billy Zane, Ray Liotta, and Norm Macdonald.","Like some out-of-control episode of Community, life is folding in on itself with meta-jokes. Only in a post-apocalyptic vision of unending late capitalism like that of Blade Runner or Judge Dredd would entertainment and advertising merge so seamlessly. Yet, that's what is happening (not for the first time), and the merger here is fast food and one of those fictional dark visions of the future. It's wrinkling brains.
The new Colonel Sanders at KFC is RoboCop. (It's the original and not the sleek version from the 2014 reboot with Joel Kinnaman.) The fried chicken purveyor announced the robo-news February 21, saying, ""He once protected the streets of Detroit. Now he’s protecting KFC’s Secret Recipe. Meet Colonel RoboCop.""
String bow ties meet justice in new commercials featuring the 80s sci-fi icon. The chicken chain is putting a little narrative into the tie-in, saying RoboCop is protecting the Colonel's secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, even making reference to RoboCop's prime directive. Starting February 24, Chew Boom reports, RoboCop will appear in a series of new commercials. So, this isn't going to be a one-time thing.
The promo is taking place because the chain is apparently moving their secret recipe to Bahnhof's Pionen data center in Sweden. It's one of the most secure underground bunkers in the world, crafted to withstand a nuclear attack.
At this point, you should have accepted that nothing from your childhood is sacred. RoboCop could be the star of the inevitable Harry Potter reboot. But take heart from this, because it turns out some things are still sacred. Like the KFC recipe.",Eater,Thrillist,,,

McDonald's doesn't have the best reputation when it comes to health food. Instead of trying to revamp its image, the Austrian branch of the company is doubling down. Behold the ""McDonald's Schmankerl Mix,"" a big ol' bucket of assorted fried things.
It comes with 15 Chicken McNuggets; 10 fried, heart-shaped Emmentaler cheese puffs; and a choice of four sauces. In fairness to McDonald's Austria, it's unlikely anyone is visiting the chain specifically to order a salad, despite its attempt to rebrand. But this is a pretty extreme example of over-the-top gluttony. Cardiologists in the county must be smiling.
Perhaps McDonald's Austria thinks this is a typical meal in the United States, and it's simply attempting to pay homage to the company's American roots. This dish sounds like something that might be found on the menu at Fat Ammy's in Wee Britain.","Sure, McDonald's might want you to think it can offer semi-healthy food options instead of its typical burgers and fries, but one of the company's newest -- and more gluttonous -- menu items appears to embrace its greasy, deep-fried history. It's literally a big tub of fried chicken and cheese.
As reported by Burger Business, the global fast food chain's Austrian restaurants are serving what's called the ""McDonald's Schmankerl Mix,"" which is German for ""tons of calories"" (not true). Actually, it's a KFC-style cardboard bucket filled with 15 Chicken McNuggets, 10 fried Emmentaler cheese puffs shaped like hearts (because everyone <3s cheese?), and a choice of four sauces. Totaling nearly 1,500 calories and a whopping 80g of fat, this thing shouldn't be eaten alone or in one sitting, but that doesn't make it any less tempting.

Depending on where you stand on the decidedly odd event, this could either be awesome or terrible news. Just like last year, the event organizers from Improv Everywhere decided to call the initiative off, leaving no opportunity for wild New Yorkers to board trains without pants on.
The event had happened every year in January from 2002 until 2020, and participating New Yorkers and even tourists would hop on the subway wearing everything but pants. While the event is very much in line with NYC's bizarre everyday encounters and events, it doesn't solely belong to the Big Apple. In addition to NYC, the ""No Pants Subway Ride"" takes over 60 cities worldwide.
In the end, it is just another unusual way to have a laugh. ""The idea behind No Pants is simple: Random passengers board a subway car at separate stops in the middle of winter without pants,"" reads the Improv Everywhere website. ""The participants behave as if they do not know each other, and they all wear winter coats, hats, scarves, and gloves. The only unusual thing is their lack of pants.""","For the second year in a row, the hilarious event will not happen.
New Yorkers hoping to ride the subway partly naked this year should think of other plans as, just as was the case last year, the annual No Pants Subway Ride has been canceled.
""The No Pants Subway Ride is not happening in New York in 2023,"" reads a message on the initiative's official website. ""After 19 years of producing the event, we've decided to take a break (sadly the pandemic ruined our plans of making it 20 years in a row!).""
The first year that Improv Everywhere, the comedic performance art group behind the effort, asked New Yorkers to commute with only their underwear and jackets on was 2002. Two decades ago, there were only seven participants, all of whom were men. ""They pretended not to notice each other and, if asked, claimed that they just forgot' their pants,"" reads a history of the event on the site.
The gimmick picked up media steam throughout the years: the 2004 event was filmed by ABC News 20/20 and, the year after, This American Life did the same thing for its series on Showtime.
The last No Pants Subway Ride in New York happened on January 12, 2020, in pretty ridiculous 65-degree weather.

McDonald's just can't help itself when it comes to launching new menu items: Select locations of the Golden Arches are now serving mac and cheese. The childhood favorite can currently be had as a Happy Meal entree or ordered a la carte for $1.75 at select locations in the Cleveland, Ohio area, reports Brand Eating.
Banish any thoughts of powdered cheese à la Kraft, however: According to a McDonald's employee reached via telephone, the product comes in frozen. Per promotional materials, the mac and cheese has 190 calories, about the same as a four-piece McNugget. But offering it as a Happy Meal entree means kids can feast on a meal of mac and cheese, fries, and soda, which sounds even more unhealthy than the usual burger or nuggets combo.
Cheese producers and dairy farmers are clearly loving McDonald's right now: Last month the chain introduced mozzarella sticks at select stores, and the deep-fried cheese bombs are slated to roll out nationwide in 2016. Ronald McDonald clearly has even more tricks up his sleeve for next year, too: The company just trademarked the phrase ""Signature Crafted,"" which is apparently the latest moniker for its line of fancied up burgers.

And since phantom trains clank across the rails from Stockholm to St. Louis, it's probably time you consider buying a ticket for a frightful ride to remember—besides your usual subway commute.
That's where the New Hope Railroad comes in: The Pennsylvania rail company is changing up its usual October haunted train ride offering this year, to launch an entirely new experience called No Hope After Dark, which will last for more than 100 minutes and include a brand new scare maze.
""The night isn't solely about screams and shivers,"" the website states. ""Many nights beckon with food trucks offering a delicious escape from the fright and live music casting enchanting tunes under the moonlit sky, bringing a lively respite for the brave at heart.""
The historic train departs under the cover of darkness from New Hope, Pennsylvania, and snakes its way through an eerie stretch of railroad that drifts through the woods toward the festival site dubbed ""the realm of the unknown."" Some nights, the festival will include food trucks. However, meal service won't be available on the train.
It's recommended that only adults venture out to the ghost train, but steel-nerved teenagers are welcome to scrap with the ghouls as well. The excursion is open to anyone who is aged 13 or older.
The train has first and coach class seats available. Tickets will start at $53 for coach seats, and will go up to $79 for first class seats. New Hope recommends booking your tickets in advance online at NewHopeRailRoad.com.
Rides on the train start on Friday, October 6 and run through Halloween. The train will run every Friday through Sunday throughout the month, with occasional Wednesday and Thursday dates. There will be added dates Monday, October 30, and Tuesday, October 31.
Some coach reservations have already sold out, so you'll want to book your tickets soon if you plan on riding this haunted train. And make sure to arrive 20 minutes prior to departure, as ghosts wait for no man, woman or child over the age of 13.
As willfully subjecting yourself to horror is not a natural course of action for everyone, you can always look take the railroad's entirely wholesome and not-at-all-scary Fall Excursion, which is a two-hour roundtrip journey through Pennsylvania foliage.","There’s something spooky about an old train, and the New Hope Railroad in Pennsylvania has a frightening new Halloween adventure that promises plenty of screams while you ride the rails.

On some nights, once you make your way through the maze, you’ll be rewarded with live music under the moonlit sky and food trucks serving delicious fare.

Personally, money spent on travel is always money well spent, but I would be lying if I told you that, at times, I wish I had been a little more financially conservative.
There are ways to tackle that, to make sure you enjoy your trip to the fullest while not going broke in the process. For example, picking a smart destination is a great start. The team at FloridaPanhandle.com, the travel brand that promotes the region of the same name, has got your back on that. They analyzed data from over 100 popular vacation destinations and created a list of the most expensive locations in the world—so if you're thinking about visiting one of these spots, you know what you're walking into.
To come up with the results, the site took into account a variety of factors. In addition to gathering data around accommodations and average rates, they also looked at average costs for daily transportation, top three most popular attractions, food, and flights.The absolute winner in the most expensive category was Gustavia, Saint Barthélemy, where the total cost of a single day for one person averages at a whopping $1,852—and that doesn't even include flights. According to findings, a roundtrip flight from a popular airport costs an average $2,772. The average daily meal cost is $58, and the average daily accommodation rate is pretty pricey too at $1,700 per person. If you do decide to visit, you'll be pleased to know that top attractions are free, since they're all nature-based.
For the world's second most expensive travel destination, you'll have to travel to Europe. Gstaad, Switzerland is a pretty popular winter locale, and while the scenery is breathtaking, so are the prices. Hotels are, on average, from $1,316 to $1,841 for your nightly rate, and you should expect to spend around $177 on average for daily food. On top of all that, you should also consider adding flights, which can cost an average $1,281 if flying from a major US airport.
The bronze medal goes to a US destination, but once you learn where it is, you won't find the results too surprising. Aspen, Colorado is famous for being one of the most luxurious and expensive ski towns in the world, and prices there are known to be sky-high. The average nightly rate for a hotel room is $1,385, and you'll have to add to it all the general attractions and transportation costs, which can make your expenses increase dramatically. Plus, flights aren't exactly cheap either—you should expect to pay an average $770 per roundtrip ticket from select major airports.
Take a look at the map below outlining all the most expensive travel destinations in the world.

0.75,"Walk down the stretch of Church Avenue between McDonald Avenue and Dahill Road known as Kensington’s “Little Bangladesh” with Shahana Hanif, and you’re not likely to get very far. People will stop you every few feet to talk with the 30-year-old feminist organizer and activist, and it’s clear that she’s looked to as a leader in her community.
The Kensington-born politician is set to become not only the first woman to represent District 39 on New York’s City Council, but also the first Muslim and Southeast Asian representative. Her neighborhood’s tight-knit Bangladeshi community was at the heart of her grassroots campaign, and it shows in the way she’s greeted by residents as though she’s part of their extended families.
Although some people tend to think of Jackson Heights as the epicenter of Bangladeshi culture in New York City (even Hanif’s family used to venture to Queens to eat out on special occasions when she was a child), Kensington is home to a vibrant Southeast Asian community. According to Hanif, Kensington’s Bangladeshi residents come primarily from three areas: Chittagong, Sandwip, and Noakhali, regions that are more poverty-stricken than some other places in Bangladesh.
Kensington’s Bangladeshi community is perhaps most visible in and around the restaurants and grocery stores along Church Avenue. Hanif says that there is a sort of “collective solidarity” around the hyper-regional food served in the neighborhood, and at any given time of day, you’ll find restaurants packed with Bangladeshi men having tea and samosas—the dining rooms a sort of liminal space between a community center and living room.
Although politics is her passion, Hanif grew up with one foot in the restaurant world. Her father, who was among the first wave of Bangladeshi immigrants to come to Brooklyn over 35 years ago, owns Radhuni Sweets on McDonald Avenue. Standing across the street from her father’s restaurant, the presumptive City Council member talks about the intricacies of Bangladeshi seafood dishes and how she can’t eat without fresh green chili pepper to open up the palate.
“To declare loving food is really an act of resistance for me,” Hanif says. It wasn’t always so easy for her to talk openly about food, or to be photographed while eating—something she made a point to do throughout her campaign as part of an effort to highlight small businesses, while simultaneously changing the way female candidates are portrayed. Growing up, Hanif was subject to a different set of rules and expectations than the boys in her community, which made for a complicated relationship to food. Now, she sees food not only as a vital way to fuel organizing efforts and connect with her constituents, but as a means to preserve culture.
“I look forward to eating more ... pairing this with how the city addresses food insecurity, how the city cultivates and preserves Black, brown, and immigrant food production across our ethnic enclaves. When I eat in Jackson Heights, in Flushing, I feel a connection to our immigration pathways,” she says.
Food sustainability, both in terms of access to food as well as stable jobs for restaurant and grocery workers, are issues she’s passionate about. After the pandemic shuttered many restaurants and markets in the area, Hanif worked to spearhead a crowdfunded mutual aid program for undocumented individuals in her district. And when peak Covid hit during the month of Ramadan, she focused on finding ways to provide culturally specific food to the area’s Bangladeshi and South Asian communities.
Hanif says that fighting for the dignity of restaurant and grocery workers is not only a key component of her platform, but of keeping Kensington’s Bangladeshi community thriving.
Fortunately, Kensington’s Bangladeshi food scene is not only stable, it’s thriving. Here are some of Hanif’s favorite spots in the neighborhood, from a woman-owned cafe that serves some of the best fuchka in the five boroughs to a traditional sweet shop.
Shahana’s order from Ghoroa is the beef teheri with chicken roast on the side — follow her lead, and you won’t be disappointed. A festive dish similar to biryani or pulao, teheri  is made with kalijira rice, a nutty varietal native to Bangladesh characterized by its miniature grains. Top it with some gravy from the chicken roast, then slice up and mix in the fresh green chili peppers that are served on the side to infuse your meal with a pleasant heat.
According to Hanif, Radhuni (her father’s place) is the best in the neighborhood for Bangladeshi seafood dishes. Radhuni is busy all day, but in the mornings, they turn their hot counter into an assembly line that churns out some of the best breakfast wraps in all of Brooklyn. They start with a fresh chapati the size of your face, then add any combination of spiced scrambled eggs, sauteed fresh vegetables, and aloo bhaji, a potato dish that you’ll find at almost every restaurant in the neighborhood. At night, come here for the traditional seafood dishes like patri ni machi, a masala-infused salmon dish that’s steamed inside of banana leaves.
A relative newcomer slightly off the main drag, Sonia Cafe is quickly becoming the go-to spot for Bangladeshi snacks (the best in Kensington, according to Hanif). Their samosas and piyaju are outstanding, but the real reason people come here is for the fuchka. Similar to but not quite the same as pani puri, crisp, hollow puri are filled with chickpeas, chilies, red onion, herbs, and grated hard-boiled eggs. They’re served with a container of tamarind water, which you’ll want to spoon into the puri before popping them whole into your mouth.
Like most spots on this list, Abdullah serves an all-day savory menu of curries, rice dishes, and flatbreads, but sweets are the main attraction here. They’re best known for Rasgulla—sweet dumplings made from fresh cheese curds called cchhena and semolina that are cooked in sugar syrup. The box of mixed cham cham is another great option if you want to try a few different kinds of sweets, and their brightly-colored laddu are fudgy and sweet. A longtime neighborhood fixture, this is where Hanif’s mom would order Rasgulla for special occasions.
Madhuban is Hanif’s pick for the best naan in the neighborhood, with an airy interior and a delicate char on the outside. The plain naan is perfect for pairing with all of Madhuban’s curries and stews, but the garlic naan is good enough to be a satisfying snack on its own. Hanif says beef stew is the go-to order here, and take note that even without the addition of fresh chilies, the dish has some heat. They also serve rice dishes, including teheri, biryani, and pulao, as well as a variety of traditional sweets.
Kabir’s is a great place to stop for a snack at almost any time of day. Hanif comes here for the chicken patty, which she says is unlike anything else you can get in the neighborhood. The “patty” is an ample triangle of puff pastry stuffed with spicy ground chicken. She’s also a fan of the milk tea, which is strong and bracingly sweet. It’s a perfect accompaniment to their green chili-studded pakoras, which are available in the afternoons and evenings. In the morning you can pick up a samosa, which on any given day might have slightly different ingredients in the filling.

Megan Ixim shares her favorite restaurants in Jersey City.","NYC's Bangladeshi community can rejoice. A section of Kensington's McDonald Avenue was just co-named ""Little Bangladesh"" to honor the community living in the area.
According to a 2019 survey by the Asian-American Federation, 16% of the Big Apple's Bangladeshi population lives in Brooklyn, and Kensington is one of the main hotspots. On and around the recently honored stretch of McDonald Avenue, the community thrives with Bangladeshi cafes and restaurants, which contribute to the neighborhood's culture and livelihood.
Council Member Shahana Hanif, who unveiled the new street sign together with the leaders from the local Bangladeshi community, is thrilled to further represent the community and its importance in the neighborhood. Hanif initially proposed co-naming the section of McDonald Avenue back in April, and on October 16, the sign was finally unveiled.
""It signifies our presence and power in this City—we are the fastest growing Asian community and we are a visible face that New Yorkers interact with every single day,"" Hanif wrote on an Instagram post after the ceremony. ""It is to empower us to continue advocating and organizing for a dignified life—dignified housing, dignified workplaces and wages, and dignified education and more.""",Theinfatuation,Thrillist,,,
0.75,"While I've personally got a very firm stance on the salty versus sweet debate, everyone's entitled to their own opinion -- especially when it applies to snacking. Using Google Trends, career site Zippia compiled a ranking of each state's favorite snacks and that whole ""one man's trash is another man's treasure"" phrase has never been more fitting.
The platform examined 45 different snack foods and determined which states had the biggest fans. See the map and list below to determine whether you're more of an Alaska, Hawaii, New York, or Wisconsin.
""Sweet wins over salty -- 29 states’ favorite snack is sweet,"" Zippia asserts in its findings. As always, take these results with a gram of sodium, as the site also claims that, ""across the country, and around the clock, hungry workers are crinkling chip wrappers at their desks or jamming quarters into vending machines to get their favorite candy bar."" We have a feeling those vending machines are seeing a little less action these days.","Surprise, surprise: people love Oreos.
Here are a few facts we learned today: people around the United States of America aren't as crazy about Twizzlers as you may think, sunflower seeds are considered snacks in some part of the country and—no surprise here—sweet treats reign supreme over salty ones.
The above analysis of human snacking behavior comes courtesy of a larger study carried out by Zippia, a career research online tool. The company scoured Google Trends to determine each state's favorite snack.
Unsurprisingly, the undisputed winner of the midday snack battle is the Oreo—the go-to treat in Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia. Fritos come in at second place, earning the top spot in Delaware, Kentucky and Nebraska.
But the delicious corn chips aren't the only beloved ones. It seems like America also really likes its Ruffles, Pringles, Kettle chips and salt and vinegar chips. That being said, sweets won over salty snacks across 29 states.

0.75,"In the chicken sandwich wars there are established sandwiches, there are better sandwiches, and there are sandwiches with more chicken. Jack in the Box has firmly invested in column C. While Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen was enjoying the sales bump from its two-week-long, sell-out chicken sandwich promotion and contrived social media feuds with Chick-Fil-A and Shake Shack, Jack in the Box was busy cooking up its own low-effort take on the current fast food flavor of the week: a chicken sandwich with not one, but four chicken patties.
Customizing a burger with multiple patties is a hallmark of the fast food industry. In-N-Out has its 4x4, Burger King has its Triple Stacker King, and even Wendy’s has experimented with a Quad Baconator. But few, if any, chains have ever done this to a chicken sandwich — except, of course, for Jack in the Box.
The chain’s Really Big Chicken Sandwich, which first debuted in 1995 with two patties, was revived once again for some reason on September 2 with the option of four chicken patties. For what it's worth, Jack in the Box claimed it wasn’t planning the launch in tandem with the Popeye’s sandwich.
There are a few good reasons why putting multiple fried chicken patties on a sandwich is a bad idea. Chicken sandwiches are breaded and can have sharp edges that benefit from being close to mayonnaise and a bun when customers go in for a bite. Fried chicken in sandwiches also tends to be salty and dry. Having multiple patties only amplifies those quality, turning one’s mouth into an instant desert after one bite. Finally, chicken sandwiches also tend to be thicker than fast-food burger patties, meaning managing four patties is just unwieldy. Taking this into consideration, most chains seem to have focused on improving the chicken recipe and quality of the chicken instead of merely giving customers more of it.
Not Jack in the Box, though. The Really Big Chicken Sandwich is comprised of a hamburger bun with lettuce, sliced tomatoes, mayonnaise, bacon, and slices of “Swiss-style cheese” layered between two to four breaded chicken patties. Each slab of poultry looks like the type of chicken patty one might find on a school lunch tray. The breading and height, meanwhile, give the chicken the appearance of four onion rings stacked inside a burger bun — a worthy alternative to this footnote on the chicken sandwich craze.
Despite being out for three days now, the Jack in the Box’s “more is better” approach doesn’t appear to be receiving the same hype as its Popeyes counterpart. Maybe, Jack should just stick to making great fast food tacos.
Update: This story has been updated to reflect that the Really Big Chicken Sandwich came out in 1995.","If you've spent any time on the internet lately, you've probably seen something about chicken sandwiches; namely, the meme-filled debate over whether Popeyes' first-ever sandwich is better than Chick-fil-A's original. There have been new chicken sandwich rankings, Twitter feuds, and shortage reports. And now, the grease-fueled mania has seemingly spawned some new chicken sandwich interpretations, like aptly-named Really Big Chicken Sandwich at Jack in the Box.
Have you ever been devouring a chicken sandwich and midway through you've thought, ""I could really use an extra chicken patty in this?"" Yes? How about two extra patties -- or three? Jack in the Box's new Really Big Chicken Sandwich lets you customize how much poultry you'd like between your buns, with up to four patties on one bun. Four.
The chicken sandwich comes topped with an onion-mayonnaise sauce, lettuce, tomato, and something called ""Swiss-style"" cheese, which we're guessing is part Swiss and part melty science stuff that's used to make American cheese. The more patties you add to your sandwich, the more cheese you get (just look at the photo above).
Made with 100% white meat chicken, the Really Big Chicken Sandwich comes in a double for $3.99 a combo, a triple for $4.99 a combo, or a quad for $5.99, according to a spokesperson for the chain. Six bucks for a four-patty chicken sandwich with a drink and fries (get curly fries if you know what's good for you) is not a bad deal. Is completely ridiculous, though? Probably.
Like all great fast food inventions, the Really Big Chicken Sandwich is only around for a little while, starting on September 2.
Jack in the Box may not be great at naming new menu items, but they are great and stuffing chicken in sandwiches.

Earlier this year, Amtrak introduced new special ""Night Owl Fares,"" which offer tickets between $5–20 per ride on Northeast Corridor trains between Washington, DC and New York. As the name suggests, the offer involves off-peak-hour trains departing between 7 pm and 7 am (originally, the promo's hours were between 7 pm and 5 am, but the time period just got extended).
Whether you're a night owl or an early bird, this is the deal for you. The promotion applies to Amtrak's Coach tickets on Northeast Regional and a few other select routes, and it includes stops in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC. Now, Amtrak just added new trains to the promotion, which now also applies to select segments between New York and Boston.
Night owls commuting between New York and Washington will only have to pay $20 for their ticket, which is the same price travelers will have to pay to go from New York to Boston. Traveling between New York and Philadelphia, instead, will be even cheaper, with tickets priced at $10. For $15, passengers will be able to travel between New York and Baltimore, or between Washington, DC and Newark, while $5 train rides will be available between Washington, DC and Baltimore, or for travel connecting New York and Newark.

Stop by any day until midnight, and make sure to order a fried chicken sandwich.
There’s a difference between late-night on a weekday versus a weekend. While a beer and fried chicken sandwich might suffice on Tuesday, Saturday may require a burger topped with jerk fries and jerk mayo followed by milkshakes and frosé. Harlem Shake understands this, and offers all of it until 11pm during the week and 2am on weekends.
Berry Park is a rooftop for people who don’t like rooftops.

With string lights hanging over umbrella-covered picnic tables and turf floors, Freehold’s big backyard is so nice that we’d happily hang out there even if they only served blue drinks. Fortunately, that’s not a decision you’ll be faced with, as the drink menu at this Williamsburg bar ranges from excellent cocktails to large-format margaritas to 11-ounce pours of malbec for $12.
The burritos at Maya Taqueria are approximately the size of 1980s car phones.

The rooftop patio at this cocktail bar is always one of the best outdoor drinking options in Williamsburg, and Wednesday through Sunday until midnight, it still is. They’ve also put some tables on the sidewalk out front in case the roof is full or you have a fear of not very high heights.
A beer garden isn’t a place where beers are grown. If that statement is obvious to you, then this Hoboken spot’s name alone should paint a fairly complete picture of what it’s like. Get a picnic table with some friends, order sausage platters and giant pretzels, and drink any of their 70+ beers until 11pm on Thursdays or midnight on weekends.

You have a lot of snacking to do, so start simple: Post up at the bar and pair your tipple of choice with the kale salad ($6), which tempers the greens’ bite with chunks of Red Delicious apple and a citrus vinaigrette, or the roasted beets ($8), delicately dressed with Greek yogurt, balsamic vinegar and fresh tarragon. For a more shareable option, try a few orders of the deviled duck eggs (two halves for $4). Tue–Wed, Sun until 2am, Thu–Sat until 4am.
Co-owners and siblings Jacqueline and Fabrizio Pirolo drew on European influences as much as their Italian heritage to craft a menu that offering something for every palate. You can’t go wrong with any of the affordable small plates at this sibling-run establishment, but we find ourselves most often returning to the creamy polenta with spicy sausage ($10), warm butternut squash ($11) and homemade cavatelli with pork sugo ($15). The kitchen’s rendition of patatas bravas ($7), supremely crispy fingerlings served with sriracha and mayo, is also compulsively craveable. Mon‑Thu until midnight; Fri, Sat until 1am.
We hope you saved room for grilled cheese, because this whiskeycentric tavern serves seven different varieties. The Karen ($7) pairs fromage blanc, Gruyère, sharp cheddar and Havarti on sourdough; the rich Maefred ($6) combines gooey double-crème Brie with local mushrooms, diced onions and fresh rosemary on ciabatta. Nightly until 4am.
Forgo the usual meat-and-cheese plates and turn your attention to the Vittles section of the menu at this chic but low-key neighborhood spot. Pigs-in-a-blanket get punched up with large hunks of spicy Italian sausage ($7), and bacon-wrapped dates swap out standard blue or Gorgonzola cheese for melty Gouda ($7). If you’re craving something sweet and haven’t yet had your fill of cheese-and-toasted–bread combos, the pressed sandwich with Nutella and goat’s-milk ricotta ($6) balances its fillings just right. Otherwise, go for the chocolate panna cotta ($6), an enhanced riff on the creamy, puddingesque dessert that tops the custard with house-made huckleberry jam and a sprinkling of sea salt. Nightly until 4am.
Billyburg brunchers turn this cash-only bistro into Wait Central on weekends, but the after-hours atmosphere tends to be more manageable. The best spots to perch are at the polished wooden bar and in the back room, where friends can gather around an old-timey hearth in winter. You can sample classic hors d’oeuvres regardless of when you’re there or where you sit, including house-made duck pâté ($11) and escargots ($9). And if you ask us, a side of thin, parsley-speckled pommes frites ($4.50) is always a good idea. Those who’ve managed to work off some of the earlier nibbles might have room for one of Le Barricou’s French classics, such as a rib-sticking version of coq au vin ($15), but we’d recommend saving that for another day—or night.

0.6666666667,"McDonald’s has tried, desperately, to get into the chicken sandwich game over the past few years. Last year, they introduced a chicken sandwich with pickles on a bun to their dollar menu, a clear attempt to compete with the classic Chick-fil-A sandwich, but it never quite caught on. Neither did their buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich. Clearly, McDonald’s was getting the message they should stick with nuggets because sandwiches aren’t its forte. But in the chicken sandwich renaissance that’s taking over fast food, obviously they tried again, this time with a spicy BBQ chicken sandwich that apparently sucks.
According to a Business Insider taste tester, “It was like McDonald’s slapped two chicken tenders on a bun with some onion slivers and BBQ sauce. I wondered why McDonald’s had even bothered to release it.” While Delish testers said the bun was good, others concluded the BBQ sauce was not spicy at all. And The Takeout says it deserves a “participation trophy,” but that you’d be happier ordering nuggets. And maybe they thought having BBQ sauce would differentiate them from the sea of fried chicken sandwiches, but overall the sandwich has a very dad-trying-to-prove-to-you-he’s-still-with-it vibe. You’re better off just bringing a bun to Popeyes.","Although the summer of the chicken sandwich is receding, McDonald's is hoping to get a bite of the buzz with its brand-new Spicy BBQ Chicken Sandwich. It's not a standard fried chicken sandwich with a plain chicken patty and pickles (like Popeyes' coveted sandwich), but its spiciness makes it an exciting addition to the fast food giant's menu.
I'm interested in why McDonald's went with a BBQ chicken sandwich, rather than capitalizing on the hype that still surrounds Nashville hot chicken or doubling down on a traditional, spicy chicken sandwich with pickles that's not submerged in sauce. Whatever the case, I was pleasantly surprised by McDonald's iteration of a spicy BBQ chicken sandwich. It miraculously hit all the right notes and genuinely tasted agreeable, though was admittedly messy to get into.
BBQ is not my sauce of choice for chicken. I'm typically a honey mustard or ranch type of girl, and would never go out of my way to order BBQ sauce for anything (except, you know, barbecue). But this BBQ sauce was admirable; it offered deep smokiness and plenty of heat -- the type that creates a warming sensation on your tongue, but doesn't make you sweat and curse. The sauce was plentiful on the sandwich, oozing out between the sesame seed buns and sticky on my fingers, yet the chicken patty retained a crispy, satisfying exterior. I appreciated that. Too often, glazed fried chicken is reduced to soggy, unappealing afterthoughts.
The pickles provided a nice tang to cut through the sweetness of the sauce and gave some extra crunch, alongside the onions. I do love raw onions to counterbalance an overwhelming sauce, but I have to admit the slivers were not my favorite addition. For starters, as slivers instead of diced squares, I found the onion pieces to be too slippery, awkwardly splayed out over the chicken patty before sliding out and dropping to the bottom of McDonald's cardboard boxed carriers. Additionally, the onions didn't have enough of that quintessential raw bite. McDonald's didn't share what type of onions it uses for this sandwich on its website. Its flavor, however, was akin to a yellow onion; gentle and sweet and almost apple-like. I would have preferred the intensity of a white onion.
In addition to the new Spicy BBQ Chicken Sandwich, McDonald's also debuted glazed tenders. Instead of a drizzle of the smoky BBQ sauce, the tenders are tossed to order and completely covered in sticky sweet glaze. Since I was already at McDonald's, I figured I'd try the tenders too and give you the lowdown.
The tenders are skippable. There's nothing else to help combat the overwhelming flavor of BBQ sauce; no pickles, no onions, no soft buns to absorb and dial back some of the flavor. Instead, you're left with tenders that have become a tad soggy thanks to their submersion in sauce and offer no reprieve from sweet and smoky flavors.
McDonald's is offering the Spicy BBQ Glazed Tenders and Spicy BBQ Chicken Sandwich only for a limited time, so if you're a BBQ sauce fiend and ready to continue gorging on all types of chicken sandwich iterations, make sure you fit this newest menu item in your rotation.

After a summer where moving to a new apartment or renegotiating your lease felt like facing NYC's final boss, the rental market seems to be cooling off a tiny bit. According to the apartment rental website Zumper, the median NYC rent dropped 2.3% between September and October. A separate report from The Real Deal estimates that the national median decreased .07% for one-bedrooms and 0.8% for two-bedroom apartments.
Earlier this summer, NYC witnessed rent increases both for rent-stabilized apartments and for market-rate units. Tenants living in rent-stabilized homes were hit with the steepest increase in prices in over a decade, and saw one-year leases go up by 3.25%, while the board voted for a 5% increase on two-year leases. Meanwhile, market rates went through the roof after a period of intense decline brought on by the initial COVID-19 lockdowns.
Rent increases have been slapping New Yorkers even harder than one might think when considering the role inflation played. According to a recent StreetEasy study, the gap between real wage growth and rent prices in August was 23% when taking inflation into account. StreetEasy found that real wages actually decreased by 9.1% because of inflation, while rent prices hiked 13.4%, which creates the widest gap since the 2008 housing crisis.
Even though a 2.3% drop might seem a minimal, it is a hopeful change for the sky-high rental market. Appraiser Jonathan Miller told Curbed that, according to his analysis, the slight change could lead to a more balanced rental market in which broker fees might lower and bidding wars could stop. Although the actual decrease is small, it could be a sign of better things to come.","A bit of good news before the weekend.
The trend is still a very slow one, but it's clearly happening: rent prices all across New York City are finally going down. It's been a long road, we know.
Two different recent studies suggest that the local real estate market is (finally!) cooling off. First off, a report from the Real Deal points to numbers that indicate that the national median rent for one bedrooms has decreased by .07% in the last month and by .8% when looking at two-bedroom apartments.
Even more specifically, apartment rental website Zumper noticed a 2.3% drop in median NYC rent prices between September and October of this year.
Yes, the changes are pretty minimal but, given the sorts of increases that city dwellers have been contending with since last summer, any sign of a cool-down is greatly appreciated.
What's more, while chatting with Curbed, appraiser Jonathan Miller noted that the shifts might lead to the end of the bidding wars that have characterized the market in recent months. ""[Renters] might once again be able to score a concession on a luxury apartment that's a hike to the subway and costs more than $5,000 a month,"" reads a report by the outlet.
As New Yorkers not-so-fondly remember, this past July, the average Manhattan rent was $5,000 for the very first time ever on record. In addition to that, the Rent Guidelines Board voted to raise prices in rent-stabilized homes across town on all leases starting October 1, 2022 or later. Approximately two million New Yorkers were directly affected by the decision.
We've got a long road ahead of us but this bit of good news has got given us a bit of much-needed hope.",Thrillist,Timeout,,,
0.6666666667,"Manhattanites soon won't have to trek out to Brooklyn to hear their favorite deep house music. Virgo, a new high-tech nightclub focused on bringing the genre to Manhattan, is officially opening in the Lower East Side this weekend.
Think of it as a mix between a cool basement club in London and a hip Brooklyn warehouse, and add a touch of Manhattan flair. Virgo, the latest concept by Full:Life Hospitality Group, is exactly that, and starting on November 18, it will welcome house and electronic music fans into its vast 3,000-square-foot space on Grand Street.
""Unlike Brooklyn, Lower Manhattan hasn't had a great lounge in electronic, house, and disco in recent years,"" co-founder Thatcher Shultz, who also created the popular Manhattan venues Make Believe at the SIXTY LES Hotel, Her Name Was Carmen, and Kind Regards, said in a statement. ""Now that the city's consumers have developed a taste for these genres, Virgo offers them a premium music and nightlife experience around them.""
Aimed at creating an alternative nightlife experience to the mainstream Manhattan music scene, Virgo is highly committed to ensuring premium music quality. Thanks to its state-of-the-art VOID sound system, which was imported from the UK, guests can enjoy a selection of local and international DJs every week, and they can let loose surrounded by incredible lighting and effects.
""We invested heavily into our sound and lighting equipment because we know how important they are to the house and electronic scene specifically,"" co-founder Duncan Abdelnour said in a statement. ""Lights and effects offer an added sensory element that can help build up excitement and emotion. And our world-class speakers and equipment ensures DJs don't have to compromise their sound to play in Manhattan.""
Inside, LED lighting walls and infinity mirrors enhance the sensory experience and play off the sound. A custom purple concrete bar with teal upholstery adds a pop of color to the space, which also features a separate shag-carpeted ""Boiler Room"" for DJs to play different music on an independent audio system in the back of the venue.
Virgo is located at 342 Grand Street , and it is open Thursday through Saturday from 9 pm–2 am. For more information, you can visit the club's website.","Virgo hopes to bring house music to Manhattan.
Although the appeal of a giant nightclub has always been a bit lost on us, we must admit there’s something about dancing to loud music surrounded by a horde of strangers that some New Yorkers absolutely adore—which is why we’re not surprised to hear about the opening of a new club in the heart of the Lower East Side.
Dubbed Virgo, the 3,000-square-foot electronic music destination at 324 Grand Street by Orchard Street isn't only noteworthy because of its focus on deep house music, a genre that many New Yorkers think hasn't received as much attention as it deserves in recent years, but exciting because of its investment in a state-of-the-art sound system that was actually imported from the United Kingdom.
Virgo's location was also a deliberate choice, hoping to help New Yorkers enjoy house music in Manhattan without having to travel to Brooklyn, where destinations of the sort are more prevalent at the moment.
""Unlike Brooklyn, Lower Manhattan hasn't had a great lounge in electronic, house and disco in recent years,"" said co-founder Thatcher Shultz in an official statement. ""Now that the city's consumers have developed a taste for these genres, Virgo offers them a premium music and nightlife experience around them.""
Decor-wise, expect three infinity mirror installations that call out to the same aesthetic as the music genre that the space is devoted to, plus custom LED lighting walls and a purple concrete bar that matches the teal upholstery. There's also a separate shag-carpeted ""Boiler Room"" where DJs will get to play different music through an independent audio system that's hooked to the back of the venue.
As for the Virgo's moniker, it's a nod to Shultz's zodiac sign. Sometimes, a simple name goes a long way.",Thrillist,Timeout,,,
1.0,"Good morning. My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Uber first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Mr.
Balaji Krishnamurthy, head of investor relations, you may begin your conference.
Thanks, Emma. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber's first quarter 2022 earnings presentation. On the call today, we have Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi; and CFO, Nelson Chai. During today's call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, are included in the press release, supplemental slides and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com. As a reminder, these numbers are unaudited and may be subject to change. Certain statements in this presentation and on this call are forward-looking statements. Such statements can be identified by terms such as belief, expect, intend, and may.
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Uber Technologies wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements we make today, except as required by law. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today as well as the risks and uncertainties described our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2021 and in other filings made with the SEC when available. We published our quarterly earnings press release, prepared remarks, and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website about an hour ago, and we ask you to review those documents if you haven't already.
We will open the call to questions following brief opening remarks from Dara. With that, let me hand it over to Dara.
Thanks, Balaji. We delivered a very strong quarter across the board with record results on the top and bottom line. After two years of persistent and sometimes unpredictable impacts across our business, our Q1 results resoundingly affirm that we're on a strong path emerging out of the pandemic. Our focus on profitable growth, product innovation and operational excellence over the last two years has set us apart from the pack.
Our mobility team is demonstrating phenomenal execution, growing both demand and supply faster than competitors and rapidly innovating to roll out new accretive offerings, all while delivering record margins despite the macro turbulence that we all see. Delivery has continued to surprise us positively as demand has remained resilient in a reopening world, and we expect top-line growth and profitability to expand through 2022. Finally, freight reached its first profitable quarter as well. We're keenly aware that the market is placing a high value on companies generating and expanding profits as interest rates rise.
We're leading the industry in this respect. Our focus over the past two years on profitable growth has resulted in the strong top and bottom lines that we delivered in Q1. We're confident that our leadership position, our global scale, and our innovation and platform advantages will allow us to deliver significant profitability and durable growth as investors rightly expect from globally scaled technology platforms. We're committed to taking all necessary actions to continue to deliver industry-leading margins and free cash flow generation, along with a disciplined capital allocation strategy.
We've never been more optimistic about our prospects and we're determined to execute as a team to bring that optimism to fruition. With that, let's go to questions.
Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, sort of on users and on drivers.
I was wondering, Dara, in the past, you've shared stats about some of your cross-platform adoption, 17% of users in the past, etc. Any updates on what you're seeing on a cross-platform adoption for your users and drivers and just some of the benefits of your multiproduct offering integration you're seeing from that is the first one. And the second one, just a comment about the expected acceleration in delivery in the back half. Anything you'd call out there on what you're seeing on user growth, cohort or anything sort of gives you confidence in the ability to continue to celebrate the delivery business throughout potentially weaker consumer?
Yes, definitely. As far as our cross-platform usage, it remains strong and consistent really with what we went through with you at Investor Day. And one of the interesting factors that we're seeing is that as mobility is opening up, mobility of significant number of new riders are coming on onto the platform, and that gives us the opportunity to then upsell those new mobility riders to Eats, to our grocery offerings, and then ultimately to our Uber One membership plan, which is the only membership plan globally that offers both mobility and delivery offerings as well. So what we're seeing is really kind of a swelling of new audience coming in, that then we can essentially upsell our cross-platform products and then ultimately membership as well.
So we're super optimistic about all of the platform investments that we're making and the potential there. We've already launched, obviously, Uber One in the U.S. We announced launches in Mexico and Germany. We've got a number of other launches teed up for the balance of the year.
And I will remind everyone that members spend 2.7 times more than nonmembers. So as we move over, as new customers come in, we cross-sell them into the platform, we cross-sell them into membership, we can increase the spend and the lock-in that our platform provides in a way that no other monoline player can, and it's -- we already have the formula down and it's about rolling out Uber One globally and then applying the same formula over and over again. Then on the cross-platform side, the side that's invisible to I'd say most investors, is on the earner side. And we talked about how our efforts to sign up earners now are truly cross-platform.
We bring you in not to drive or to deliver, but we bring you in to earn on the Uber platform. The success there has been very, very significant. You heard I think last night, one of our competitors in the U.S. having challenges or at least looking to lean into driver supply.
Our active drivers in the U.S. and Canada are up 70% on a year-on-year basis in April. New drivers were up 121% year on year in April, and it's because we're bringing new drivers on not as Uber Rides, not as Uber Eats, but as Uber as a platform and to earn in any way, shape or form that they can on the platform, and that's proving to be a structural advantage from what we can see versus the competition, both locally and then we think ultimately, globally.
And then a question on back half for delivery.
Yes, of course. Back half for the delivery goes, it really is about the European reopenings and comps. So some of the countries, France, for example, is reopening. It is a spectacular news for mobility business.
It makes the delivery comps a little bit tougher. So I think you'll see Q2 growth rates similar to Q1, and then we expect Q3 and Q4 to accelerate. And I think you've also seen for us as a team, we've delivered on what we say we're going to do. So we're pretty confident of acceleration in the second half.
The other factor that's going to affect the second half is that with new verticals, actually very recently, along with the Albertsons deal, we are now launching the native stack of Cornershop, essentially grocery, on the Uber Eats platform. It's very, very early, but we see substantial improvement in customer experience, and we see substantial improvements in terms of conversion on the Uber Eats native stack. So we think that the U.S. growth rate that is already pretty high, is going to significantly accelerate in the second half of the year, which again gives us confidence as the delivery growth rates in the second half of the year.
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask two on the mobility product side, Dara. Just if you could talk a little bit about the efforts so far with upfront fare and destination info and some of the key benefits and the rollout timing there. And then also about -- around UberX Share, how that's reimagined and the key points of differentiation.
Yes, absolutely. As far as upfront destination, one of the most significant complaints that we get from our earners and our drivers is that they don't know where the upfront destination is. And if you go back to the origins of this business and how pricing was built, pricing originally was based on time and distance, and that comes from, let's say, the taxi days. But the fact is that based on the destination, the value of a ride, which may take the same amount of time and distance for a driver, may be very different based on the destination.
So if you're going from the airport into Central San Francisco and you're going to get a ride as soon as you drop the person off, that's a pretty valuable ride. If you carry a passenger, same time and distance, into the outskirts of the neighborhood and then have to drive back empty for, let's say, 30 or 40 minutes, that's not a ride that's particularly valuable to an earner. And if you're purely basing your charges on time and distance, essentially those two rides are priced equally. We think that's a bug in our system.
And it certainly does not serve the best interests of the earners. So now with our new system, we display the full information of the ride, especially what the destination is. Our algorithms are then able to take signal, let's say, the trip out to the outskirts where the drivers have to come back empty, we will then price up that trip so that the earner trip earns the fair value of that fare and also knows exactly what they're accepting or not accepting. That also improves the consumer experience because cancellation rates, once drivers understand what the destination is, go down as well.
There's a huge amount of technology that has to go into developing this kind of a system because essentially, your pricing systems have to get signal based on earner behavior in order to hone in the pricing to truly price kind of that trip based on the market clearing price that earners are willing to accept that trip with. So there's a huge amount of ML data work that goes into that system. But we think it's fundamentally a better way. And the feedback that we're getting from our driver partners has been quite positive.
It's a big change though, I'll tell you. And there's a lot of debugging going on. There's a lot of algorithmic work to make sure that the earner experience is as great as it is, but we're very, very optimistic about this fundamental change. Last thing I'll say about this is, this is one of those invisible or not so invisible benefits of the platform.
This is actually how delivery have been pricing their trips for some period of time. Delivery companies show upfront where you pick something up, they show an upfront fare. It's exactly like introducing upfront fare to Uber riders. And our being a multi-platform, multiproduct business, allows us to take learnings from one side of our business, apply it to the other.
And instead of kind of starting from scratch, we've already -- we're adolescents now turn -- now using all open knowledge from our delivery business and passing it on to the mobility business. So lots of advantages having a single marketplace team, a single technology team, thinking about the best of both worlds, and constantly applying learnings for one to the other. And then as far as UberX goes, UberX Share, we're super excited about the business. I think with Share, we're looking to resolve a fundamental issue that the older pool model had, which is the interests of the rider and the interests of Uber were misaligned, right, which is the rider would ask for a pool trip hoping not to be batched and Uber, obviously, would want that trip to be matched in order to achieve the economics that we expect.
With UberX Share, there's an upfront discount, and when you are matched with another rider, you get a higher discount on your trip. So all the time, interests are aligned in this kind of system and we're very, very encouraged by the early signal that we're seeing, and we're looking to launch UberX Share in about 15 markets in the next quarter, and we will continue to expand from there. So both upfront fare and UberX Share are areas that we're quite excited about and areas where there's a lot of innovation going in per piece.
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can, on the delivery business. You grew, as you talked about, earners at a very high rate, especially in the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape for earners in the delivery business and where you see yourself vis-a-vis competition from a scale standpoint? Especially in the markets that you think are the most important to you where it lines up the most with the mobility business.
And then on the expansion of categories, how important is it to get some of those categories right as stand-alone apps and stand-alone businesses versus them being broadly more folded into the Uber app and getting the platform experience more right than wrong if you look out over the next couple years, vertical versus platform? Thanks so much.
Sure. I think in the U.S. on the earners' side, and again, we don't necessarily look at earners now as couriers or drivers because increasingly, we want earners to earn however they want to on a particular day. They may want to stay in their little neighborhood and that accrues more to delivering food because typically, you stay within a certain radius, or they may want to make more money and right now, earnings for drivers, for example, who drive more than 20 hours on our platform, in the last quarter were $39 including tips.
So earnings are super, super high, which is great for earners. On the courier side, I wouldn't say that there's a huge amount of competition in that we've got plenty of couriers and from what we can tell, our competitors do as well. It's a very flexible way to earn, which our earners appreciate. So we have seen the number of active couriers globally, up 34% on a year-on-year basis.
And in the U.S. and Canada, up 79% year-on-year. So we're in very good shape there. And actually, a fair amount of the year-on-year increase intake rate, call it, true take rate that you're seeing in the delivery business is because we've been able to drive cost per transaction down as a result of higher efficiency in our marketplace because we have plenty of couriers.
And as we get more density in our marketplace, essentially the distances that we have to carry food and go pick up food, etc com reduced, and our algorithms in terms of routing and batching continue to optimize and get better and better and better. That is essentially upside as it relates to net revenue. And it really doesn't cost anything. It just cost engineering time to achieve, which is time that we have.
And then as far as the super app versus multi-app consumer experience, the way that we're doing it is on the consumer side, we're looking to get the best of both worlds. Think about it in the same way that Facebook has a family of apps. They've got Facebook and Instagram and what's happened, they're kind of loosely coupled. Same thing with Google; they got Google and Google Maps and Google Mail, again, they are coupled.
You have one identity, one payments, etc. We're looking to achieve the same thing multiple apps, whether it's Uber or Uber Eats or Cornershop, your identity is the same, Drizly, your sign-up is the same. We treat you the same way. Your customer experience is consistently excellent.
You've got the Uber One membership that flows across all of those apps to save you on delivery fees. And at the same time, within each app, we're constantly cross-promoting one platform to the other. On Rides, we're cross-promoting Eats. We're actually super excited.
We're starting to cross-promote Rides on our Eats app. We frankly weren't sure if it's going to work. We now see a signal that it's working. Actually, we're able to resurrect riders back into the reopening through the Uber Eats app, which is something that we're super excited about.
So all the apps talk to each other, cross-promote each other. We use machine learning algorithms to figure out what is the best promotion to put in front of the right person at the right occasion. And you can imagine, lunchtime the promo may be different than drinks time, for example. On the back end, as it relates to earners, we are a single super app and essentially, you sign up to earn on Uber, and more and more, we will offer you different opportunities to earn based on what we know about your profile, based on time of day, based on where you are and based on what the opportunities are and we think that's a very, very significant structural advantage over other players in our industry, none of which has a super app model.
Thanks for all the color.
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Great. Thank you. Just given the challenges at Lyft, they talked about on driver incentives. Can you talk about the mobility supply demand dynamics and how you're going to manage what hopes to be a pretty robust opening over the next six months? And then when you look at your prepared remarks, some interesting stuff on regulatory and new use cases.
I just want to see if you feel like you're kind of getting over the hump here on regulatory, if there's real progress there. And why you've kind of decided now to expand some use cases to car rentals and travel. Does that kind of signal that the core business is now kind of on a positive trajectory? Thanks.
Yes. Listen, Justin. Our need to increase the number of drivers on the platform is nothing new nor is it a surprise. We were on this last year.
If you remember, Q2 of last year, we were very early. We saw signal and we leaned in very aggressively initially with incentives into improving our driver supply. And then we followed up the investment in incentives with tons and tons of innovation in terms of products, in terms of improving the driver signup flow, in terms of welcoming drivers to the Uber family, and then giving them opportunities, delivery opportunities, or rise opportunities. We see the sooner an earner can earn on the platform, the higher our sign-up rate to that first trip and often, we can get earners earning on the platform faster with delivery than we can with mobility because of regulations or background checks, etc.
So we're able to engage that earner with money in their pockets really, really early. And at the same time, we've invested in experiences where instead of, for example, you're having to upload your documents into our systems, we will go connect to insurance companies, DMVs, etc. And as we build out those APIs, essentially, upload those documents automatically versus having you do the hard work, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't and sometimes we may get the document right or wrong. We have -- we talked about upfront destinations for earners as well.
So we have pivoted the company to being earner-centric, innovating for earners, thinking about the earner experience, treating earners as with respect and dignity, and building for them versus building just for the company. This has been an activity that we've been on for a year and we feel very, very well prepared for the future. We're constantly watching supply demand dynamics. We're constantly watching supply hours.
Earner retention is improving. Engagement on the platform is improving. So we feel as good about our driver supply in general, our earnings earner position as we ever have. That said, we know we have to improve.
We have to keep increasing the number of new drivers on the platform. We're focused on resurrecting a number of drivers as well, and we're focusing on increasing engagement on the platform because the earnings levels are so high. So there's a lot of work to do ahead of us, but this is a machine that's rolling. Like this, the earner team at all levels, at the operational level, at the technical level, at the engineering level with ML algorithm optimizing, for example, driver incentives, all of it is rolling, and we know all of it has to work well in order for us to hit our really aggressive targets in the balance of the year.
And then as far as the regulatory process and new use cases. I'd say the new use cases are us playing offense. We have seen the cross-platform initiatives throwing from one essential service to the other from Eats to Rides, from Eats to Groceries, etc. We know how to cross-promote use cases.
There's a huge amount of trust and frequency and comfort with our products. We have your identity. We understand where you are. We have your payment details, etc.
So our adding new use cases such as car rental or travel bookings or adding new supply areas like taxi, they're just natural growth areas for us. And because we've already acquired the customer, because we already have built trust with that customer, we're essentially able to continue to increase engagement with our customer. The more engaged our customers are, the more we retain those customers and we're able to monetize those MAPCs as a result. So it's kind of a win-win-win on that front.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.
Thanks. Two questions, please. There's been a lot of focus on retail marketing. So at least across the industry.
So could you just give us a little bit of an update on where you are in terms of putting together Advertising revenue? I know you laid out a goal at your Investor Day? Any update on that? And then secondly, on the MAPCs numbers, any way to think about what the -- what should happen to MAPC growth going into the next quarter? I think that was -- that sequential decline, I think, was a lot of omicron hit. So are you back to a point where it's reasonable to expect MAPCs to grow through the balance of the year?
Yes. I'll start the second one first, which is we're absolutely seeing MAPC growth continue to accelerate post omicron. So for example, while MAPC growth for the quarter was -- or MAPCs were $115 million, up 17% for the quarter, in March, they were up at $120 million, up 20% on a year-on-year basis. So we're seeing MAPC growth accelerate, and we expect to see that acceleration build into April and the balance of Q2.
We absolutely see the reopening as a very, very big MAPC driver, especially on the mobility side. So expect MAPC to continue to grow and, if anything, to accelerate into the second quarter. As far as our Advertising business goes, continued strength there. We essentially more than tripled the business on a year-on-year basis.
And we are very much on track to hit the targets that we laid out during Investor Day.
Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is now open.
Thanks. Two, if I can. Just first, can you talk about the U.K. mobility business and where that is on kind of the path back to profitability under the worker classification and VAT charges? Can the U.K., do you think, get back to prior levels of profitability? And where are we on that journey? And then the second one, in the script, you talked about now expecting to be free cash flow positive for the full year.
Any update on how you think about the potential for capital return given your cash position and kind of where the shares are trading? Anything you could share that would be great.
So, Lloyd, I'll do the second one first, and Dara will do the U.K. after. So as you know, we're still coming out of the pandemic. We were clear early on that we were going to focus on making sure we add ample liquidity.
I covered this on Investor Day to let you know that free cash flow largely trails EBITDA by about $1 billion a year. And so that's why we have the confidence to make the statement that we'll be free cash flow positive this year. We certainly recognize, given what's going on in the market right now, and we encourage all to get toward being free cash flow positive because we think it will be very important as we think about the cycle. As we think about capital return down in the future, we certainly are going to be open to it, right? So we recognize that we're not going to get -- we don't get paid for hoarding capital.
As you know, in the past, there may be some things we want to do, and we will certainly look at capital return as one of those levers. But again, I think it was important that as you think about the pragmatic walk that we've taken on capital and on liquidity importantly. And as you know, we've taken every opportunity to improve our debt in terms of the amount of both extending and reducing the debt. And so I think you'll expect -- you'll hear more about this as we go into next year, but I think it was important to get to this point where we could declare that we'll be free cash flow positive this year.
And then we understand about capital return. I think if you think of our equity stakes, while they were mark-to-market down, they're very good sources of liquidity. And many of those lockup restrictions expire, if you will, or come due during the course of this year. nd so depending on where markets trade as well, we'll have plenty of sources to return capital.
Yes. And I think as far as the U.K. goes, look, we made tremendous progress in the U.K. We moved to the worker model.
We're now compliant with merchant status and we've recently been granted a private hire vehicle operator license for 30 months, which is terrific. ur relationship with the city is second to none, and we're committed to Citycon's goal of electrifying our fleet by 2025 in London, a real leader in environmental impact and something that we're firmly behind. e absolutely believe that it is a condition for every operator's license to move to merchant. We have not seen some of our competitors do so, but the TfL has been very, very clear that they will enforce those rules.
So we just think a level playfield is just a matter of time. And the ones that are ignoring the law are either accruing liability, they're going to pay for it sooner rather than -- sooner or later, one way or the other. We can't tell you the timing, but it is going to happen. s it relates to our business on the ground, our CIPD position is very strong.
So we're very confident as it relates to our category position. And our business has returned to solid profitability. Now we see profitability in the U.K. healthy and improving into the balance of the year.
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Hey, guys. Just two kinds of big picture questions. First is on the delivery side. So on convenience and Grocery, I think there's a debate whether 3P delivery or these new dark store concepts are a better business model.
So how do you view that? I know most of your businesses started in 3P, but would it make sense to build out 1P grocery or convenience eventually? And then second question is on the taxi partnership. So I think you said you want every taxi on the planet on Uber by 2025. Can you just talk about how those partnerships might impact the unit economics in rides? Thanks a lot.
Operator, somebody needs to be muted.
My apologies about that. Please continue.
OK. We'll try again. So as far as 3P versus 1P. I think our goal is to provide a great experience as it relates to our eaters and our shoppers who want their groceries and they want it fast.
All of our data suggests that getting your groceries inside of an hour is a spectacular experience. I think there's lots of debates as to whether it's got to be 10 minutes or 15 minutes or half an hour. And if anything, we see a bunch of the 10- or 15-minute folks move to the half an hour area, which is more of where we are. We believe we can get a spectacular experience for our grocery shoppers through partnerships with our grocery partners.
This is what they do day in and day out. And for example, we have a partnership with Carrefour, which is a huge player in France, where they are adjusting their model. They're taking everything that they've learned in their grocery space, years of experience and essentially, they're reducing the number of goods that they have and reducing the delivery times to that 20, 30 minutes, which is a delightful experience. So we believe that we're able to get the -- essentially 100% of the experiential benefits of fast grocery through partnership and avoid the kind of capital investments that you have to make in terms of leases, opening up a bunch of stores all over cities, in addition, frankly, to the defocusing of the team.
What we build, we are building a software layer on top of the physical world. That's what we're good at. We're good at matching demand and supply in a real-time way. We do it more broadly and with audiences that are unrivaled around the globe.
And we think building a bunch of dark stores in a few cities doesn't make our network any better, and we certainly have that -- the best real-time network out there. So everything that we see right now, we're essentially partnering up on 1P and all the signals that we see as positive. We are in a very limited way, running some tests in a few countries, in Taiwan and Japan, just to make sure we understand the counterfactual because we want to be intellectually curious. At this point, we think the partnership way is a route to go.
If we ever have to switch, we have the audience. We've got millions of members. So we think it's much easier to go vertical if we ever need to. But right now, we don't see any signal that we should be going vertical especially as it relates to the defocusing of the team.
In terms of taxi, just this one for us is, we think, a no-brainer, which is we talked at the beginning of this call and a lot of folks have talked about how bringing driver supply on in the U.S. and globally is an incredibly important initiative. We have about 4.5 million total Uber earners all around the world. There are 4 million taxis globally, 4 million taxis versus 4.5 million total Uber earners that we have.
These taxis typically are underutilized relative to our earners. We think that the technology that serves these taxis can be better and we're helping partner with them as it relates to technology. We think that the days of you're going on a street and waving your arm to hail taxis, we think those days are over. Like we think any entity that is dependent just on street hail is like a retailer who pretends that the Internet never happened.
So this is the time and we're seeing taxi partners want the benefit of our technology. They want the benefit of our demand. They understand that we're all in it together, and this can be a benefit for us. It can be a benefit for taxi drivers.
It can be a benefit for fleet owners, etc. So this is a win-win-win, and it's a big opportunity, 4 million taxis on a global basis. And we are now kind of going country by country, city by city. We're obviously excited about the announcements in New York City and San Francisco, but I want to make sure that our investors and analysts understand we've been at this for a while, right? We've been signing up taxis in Spain and Japan and in Korea and we have built out an experience set as to how you build out the taxi product and how you optimize the experience for the rider as well.
This is another benefit of our being a global company. We're coming to the U.S. with the confidence and experience that we built in Spain, Japan and a bunch of other markets as it relates to taxis. So we think it's a huge opportunity, and the team is incredibly excited to get going on it.
Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Great. So first, Dara, given that you have a meaningful competitive advantage on the ride share side, would your driver supply position versus competitor, how do you think about the opportunities to gain share? I mean it feels like you can manage consumer prices at better levels versus competition. Can you talk about the opportunity to gain share? And then second on Eats, one of the fears investors have on this space is that every product category that's saw benefit from the pandemic is now seeing some form of accelerated reversal may be due to churn or retention issues. Food delivery has been very resilient.
Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of frequency and usage underlying the bookings growth? Thanks so much.
Yes. Absolutely. As far as gaining share versus our competition, I'll tell you, gaining share isn't a priority for us right now. It's happening naturally in some of the reopenings and it could be because of the mix shift.
For example, travel or the travel category is growing at very, very significant rates, and we tend to skew high on the travel category or the Uber for business category. So we are observing some share gain in the U.S. and frankly, in most countries around the world, we're observing these kinds of share gains and it may be that the kind of consumer that's an Uber consumer is higher end, travels a lot, travels for business, etc is coming to the platform pretty quickly. And obviously, we're a beneficiary of that.
Our focus is on profitable growth. And we're -- I think we're able to achieve profitable, call it, durable growth while gaining share versus our competitors because of the power of the platform. And so it's kind of naturally happening. It's not something that we have to lean into.
And we're a lot less focused on, let's say, our competitors or competitor share as we are the opportunity to grow the business durably to add on new segments such as taxi or hail-ables, two-wheelers, three-wheelers or lower-cost product, whether it's high-capacity vehicles, etc. That's really the focus and the share will take care of itself, although it has been taken care of itself, and we're quite constructive in terms of share gains. As far as the delivery reopening impact and frequency. Listen, when you look at our delivery business, MAPCs were up 4% year on year.
Basket sizes were up 3% year on year. Frequency was up 4% year on year. So all of the core metrics that drive the business are positive and because of our innovation, as it relates to bringing more earners onto the platform and then the density of the network driving cost per transaction down, we're able to improve the margins of the delivery business. So we're happy with the trends that we see, and we think that our frequency is going to also be assisted by our cross-platform usage and a higher penetration of Uber One members into our gross bookings base.
We are -- the penetration of Uber One members is still low, generally for us and low compared to some of our competitors. And we see higher frequency with Uber One members. So we think that's a natural tailwind that can maybe combat some of the headwinds that some folks are seeing in the reopening.
By the way, one note, I didn't answer, and I want to answer all questions. I didn't answer the question on taxi margins. So as it relates to taxi margins, First of all, margins differ by geography. So for example, in the U.S., the deals that we've done with the taxi companies should be at quite attractive margins that are consistent with the rest of our business.
In some markets, let's say, of Japan or some developing markets, our taxi margins are lower. But we've consistently seen we're able to start at lower margins and then increase margins over a period of time. So when we think about the growth of our mobility business and the 10% incremental EBITDA margins that we are looking to deliver, our core product, that's the Uber Eats, X or Reserve, or Black, those will tend to deliver higher than 10% incremental margins. We'll use some of those, the incremental above 10% to invest in products such as taxi, three-wheelers, two-wheelers, etc, in order to drive what I'll call durable growth, MAPC growth, etc.
And we're constantly balancing the two. And hopefully, you've seen as it relates to our execution over the past couple of quarters and years that we have our hands on all the different levers in order to deliver very, very healthy top-line growth and the kind of profitability that investors are especially looking for nowadays. All right. Next question.
Our next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Just a follow-up on the regulatory update here. Maybe, Dara, can you talk about maybe the ongoing conversation with the New York state, given your recent wins in Washington and also pretty strong ongoing support from drivers in Massachusetts? Did these victories kind of help you move the conversation along? And also what are the key friction you're looking to resolve?
James, thanks for the question. The most important factor that is helping these conversations move forward is that drivers want to be independent contractors. Drivers price flexibility above anything. That's the reason why they earn on our platform.
I think everybody knows in the U.S., if you want a job, you can have a job, if you want a full-time job. It's not a problem getting a job, but our opportunity -- flexible work opportunities and healthy work opportunities is unique. You can work for us, you can work for competitors, you can work when you want, you can work, where you want, etc. It's pretty powerful.
And I think that fortunately or unfortunately, in our Zoom world where white-collar workers now have a lot more flexibility, maybe they also appreciate the value of flexibility in a way that they couldn't appreciate previously. So as it relates to New York or any other state, the good news is regulators are more and more aware of what drivers want and drivers overwhelmingly want flexibility and they want other protections and benefits, whether it's minimum earnings or other benefits which may change state to state to state. So I don't want to comment on New York specifically. We're having promising discussions there, but you never know when kind of the regulatory winds move one way or the other.
But generally, I would say that the regulatory momentum is positive. You see that in Washington. In Massachusetts, we have a ballot initiative out there. We are very confident of our prospects in Massachusetts.
And essentially, we'd like to see a negotiated settlement in these cities. Certainly, we'll look to have a negotiated settlement in Massachusetts but we're confident if we have to go to the ballot. And hopefully, New York will get there, but we can't predict the time.
Let's take the last question, operator.
Our last question today comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Great. Thanks. Two questions. What were the mobility rides volumes in the first quarter versus pre-COVID levels? And what are the kind of the key use cases where there is headroom to close the gap, particularly as we look toward reopening in the second quarter and the back half of the year? And then just on grocery and other delivery, what was that as a percent of delivery gross bookings in the first quarter? And just discuss any progress that you saw in the quarter and as we round through the year? Thank you.
So our Rides business is actually fully recovered versus where we were in pre-pandemic levels. And in fact, even on a trip basis, we're more than 95% recovered globally. We still have some room in the U.S. We're still in the high 70s in terms of recovery there.
But we've really seen all use cases come back, including airport travel, pretty much in line with pre-pandemic levels. So we were seeing a very, very strong reopening on the mobility side.
As far as delivery goes, new verticals, ARRs were -- continue to be higher than $4 billion. And we're seeing very, very strong growth there. We're also integrating the new verticals experience in a native way on Uber Eats and we're seeing really, really promising early signal there. And when you look at as of March, less than 10% of the users who completed a delivery trip on Uber in the last month ordered new verticals.
So there's huge opportunity there. That number is up 400 basis points year on year but we think that the potential of essentially upselling new verticals opportunities to our Eats -- to our eaters is very, very young, and there's a ton of upside left there.
All right. Great. We can wrap up there.
All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call, and great work to the Uber team. Q1 was a super, super strong quarter. We're expecting more of that in Q2.
I think this is a quarter where we're starting to show separation against our competitors in terms of execution and that execution showing up in the financials in terms of a healthy growth profile that we expect to see for some period and also profit generation and free cash flow generation coming up this year that we're very, very excited about. So thanks, everyone, for joining, and we'll talk to you next quarter.

1.0,"If you’re part of the LGBTQ+ community, finding a certified financial advisor who is LGBTQ+-friendly can be both important and challenging.
How can you get the best financial advice from an industry that doesn’t seem to have a very diverse pool of people from which to choose? Money is personal. What works for another person may not work for you. But here’s the thing: financial planning should be available to everyone. You deserve the absolute best financial advice, and finding a financial advisor who caters to your specific financial needs as an LGBTQ+ person can make all the difference to your future financial stability.
The amount that transgender women earn for every dollar earned by an American worker.
Rae says that such statistics make finding an LGBTQ+-friendly financial advisor more crucial for anyone dealing with transgender issues. “The attacks on the transgender community pose a wider set of financial challenges. The ability to get gender-affirming care will definitely affect decisions on where someone chooses to live. Likewise, where you live can affect what insurance will or will not cover.” It makes having an advisor who knows all the ropes even more important.
LGBTQ+ people who do decide to have children generally face steep financial costs for things such as in vitro fertilization, surrogacy, and adoption procedures. DINKS or not, there is an increased need for money, which can be best amassed through the kind of smart financial planning you can get from an LGBTQ+ or LGBTQ+-friendly advisor.
You should do your homework and make sure that the planner is legitimate and has a good service record before you hire them. Using a financial advisor search engine can help you find reviews about the advisor and verify their credentials.
Ideally, a financial advisor will have experience working with LGBTQ+ clients and can provide you with examples of challenges and strategies that can benefit your overall finances. Notice the advisor’s body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice when answering these questions. If they acknowledge the importance of these questions, they may be a good fit in your selection of a financial advisor.
Consider the type of client whom the advisor typically serves. For instance, some might take clients from all over the country, while others limit their practice locally.
Many levels of qualifications exist for financial professionals. A “financial coach” doesn’t require any formal training or certifications. Some organizations issue easy-to-get credentials that sound more impressive than they are. Not all credentials are created equally.
A CFP designation requires successful completion of a rigorous examination, which generates trust and implies competence. A chartered financial analyst (CFA) also must complete in-depth studies and pass an exam. Both designations have ethics and experience requirements.1516 Look for these credentials when choosing a reputable advisor.
Being a member of the LGBTQ+ community confronts a person with many challenges caused by prejudice and discrimination that are not faced by non-LGBTQ+ people. Some of these challenges make it harder to accumulate wealth. A supportive financial advisor will have good advice on how to overcome them.
There are online sources that specialize in locating LGBTQ+ and LGBTQ+-friendly advisors, but you can also use other search engines for advisors and then interview a selection with a view to determining their support and understanding of LGBTQ+ issues. In addition, asking friends and family for referrals can also yield good results.
No. Anyone can call themselves a financial advisor or planner. However, there are certain certifications, such as certified financial planner (CFP) and chartered financial analyst (CFA), that require rigorous study and the passing of an exam. These certifications are good indicators of competence.
Members of the LGBTQ+ community face financial challenges all their own, which is why it is wise for them to seek an LGBTQ+ or LGBTQ+-friendly financial advisor to guide them. Ultimately, having a supportive advisor provides a welcome level of comfort. However, even if the advisor is in sync with LGBTQ+ issues, it’s still important to vet their credentials and work history thoroughly before you sign on as a client.

According to an analysis by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, gay men earn about 69 cents on the dollar to their straight peers and lesbian women earn about 89 cents on the dollar to their straight peers. And these wage and wealth gaps are larger for queer and trans people of color.
Nevertheless, financial counselors and planners can help LGBTQ+ people navigate the tough financial questions they’re facing.
Bair wants to hear from clients about what it was like growing up, how a client’s family talked about money, whom the client loves and whom they financially support. These details are especially important for LGBTQ+ people who may be estranged from or not recognized by their family of origin.
“If you don't have your financial and legal house in order, your family's desires can come in and make decisions that exclude the people that you love and leave behind” in the event of an emergency, illness or death, says CFP Cait Howerton.
Finding an advisor who is both culturally and financially competent can help you identify and execute your financial and life goals, be it paying down credit and student loan debt, or financing your transition.
It's a common misconception that you have to be rich to need a financial planner. In fact, financial counseling and planning can be a tool for supporting LGBTQ+ families and communities to realize their goals, protect them amid challenges to trans and queer personhood and family security, and (potentially) shrink wealth gaps.
While there are many more LGBTQ+ individuals than LGBTQ+ financial planners, financial counselors and planners allied with the community are immersing themselves in the cultures and demographics they seek to serve. They can help you start small with paying off debt, financing a medical procedure and investing for retirement.
Financial counselors help with everything from learning money management and creating financial goals to helping you access tax credits, public assistance agencies and manage debt. This is especially important given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are more likely to live in poverty, experience homelessness and face discrimination and violence, including from their families of origin.
Long term, a certified financial planner can assist in creating a comprehensive financial plan. CFPs hold rigorous financial certifications and are fiduciaries, meaning they are legally required to act in their clients' best interests.
To find a financial counselor or financial planner near you, you can start by searching your local chamber of commerce or the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce to see if there is a financial advisor near you.
However, if you’re not out yet, or not comfortable using a planner you might run into at the grocery store, online or remote financial planning can help connect you to a member of the LGBTQ+ community or an ally.
You can use the Find an Advisor tool on the XY Planning Network website to search by LGBTQIA. Or you can search Find a CFP Professional by specialties such as ""LGBTQIA Individuals/Couples.""
Finding a financial planner who understands specific financial needs and situations can greatly improve your financial outlook, according to Dasarte Yarnway, co-founder of the Onyx Network, a platform supporting underrepresented financial advisors.
“From a money perspective, alone you go fast, together you can go far,” Yarnway says of the partnership with a financial advisor.
Once you’ve found a financial counselor or planner, the following financial, health and legal tools can help ensure your wishes are carried out in the event of an emergency or death.
Advance directives designate someone to act on your behalf in medical decisions if you’re no longer able to communicate, such as during end-of-life care.
A power of attorney allows someone else to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so on matters ranging from health care and money management to placing trades on behalf of a company.
A will details issues such as guardianship of children, funeral arrangements and distribution of property.
A trust ensures your assets go to the intended people (with tax benefits).
These are especially important for LGBTQ+ individuals and families who are not legally married, says Atlanta-based CFP candidate Kiersten Peshek.
“If clients aren’t interested in getting married, which is perfectly acceptable in relationships, we need to think about estate planning: that they inherit the house, have the ability to make health care decisions and make sure the law and family members don’t get in the way,” Peshek says.
Legally formalizing your financial, health and other wishes is especially important for children of LGBTQ+ people who may not be biologically related to their parents.
A previous version of this story gave an incorrect location for Kiersten Peshek. Peshek is based in Atlanta, Georgia. This article has been corrected.",Investopedia,Nerdwallet,,,
1.0,"If you are a good saver, you know the value of maxing out your 401(k) plan and making sure you get the employer match on your contributions. And if you're a really good saver, you may be aware of the benefits of front-loading your 401(k) contributions, adding as much as possible to your plan early in the year. Front-loading maximizes your money's time in the market, which should produce better returns for your 401(k) account in the long run.
But if you're not careful with your front-loaded contributions, you could actually be missing out on a portion of your employer match. That's ""free money"" you deserve as an employer benefit.
Let's say you make $80,000 a year in salary. If your employer matches 4% of your salary dollar for dollar, you would assume that you'll get an employer match on the first $3,200 you contribute to your 401(k). In other words, your account gets an extra $3,200 provided by the employer.
But it doesn't quite work out that way. Your employer, for instance, doesn't know if you'll work 12 full months for the year. It doesn't know whether you'll get a raise midyear or if you'll take lower compensation at some point in the year for extended time off. So, instead of matching your contribution based on your annual salary, employers usually base their matching contributions on your compensation for each pay period throughout the year.
So, that $80,000 annual salary breaks down to 24 pay periods of approximately $3,333 each, and your employer's 4% match ends up going toward the first $133 or so that you contribute in each pay period.
If you don't make a 401(k) contribution during a pay period, there's no match.
So, if you stop contributing part-way through the year, you could be missing out on a portion of your match. The reasons for stopping can vary. You might stop because you hit the annual contribution limit early (related to the front-loading of contributions strategy). Or you might stop because you thought you'd contributed enough to guarantee the company match and moved to funding an IRA, a Roth, or some other retirement accounts.
To account for this issue, some 401(k) plans have what's called a ""true-up"" provision. At the end of the year, the plan administrator will determine how much the company match should've been if you had contributed evenly throughout the year. The company will contribute those funds sometime at the beginning of the year following your contributions.
Check with your 401(k) plan administrator to see if your plan has a true-up provision. If it does, you don't have to worry as much about missing out on the employer match for contributions you've already made, but you should still consider making changes to how you contribute in the future. That's because if you're terminated or leave your job midyear, you won't get that true-up match at the start of the next year.
Let's go back to our example of the employee who gets paid $3,333 twice a month and gets a 4% employer match (equal to $133 per pay period). Normally, that person will need to contribute at least $133 (and 33 cents, to be closer to exact) to a 401(k) in each of the 24 pay periods during the year to get their full employer match. That creates a total employee contribution of $3,200 for the year (as well as the employer contribution of $3,200).
IRS rules in 2020 say that employees can make tax-deferred contributions of up to $19,500 toward their 401(k) plan. That leaves $16,300 in contributions still potentially available to add to the plan. Let's say you want to max out your contributions and your overall budget allows for that level of contribution. You also want to front-load those contributions to enhance your return and you have the discretionary income to contribute $1,000 per pay period (or an extra $867 above the minimum needed to get the match). It takes just a little more math to determine how many pay periods you should maintain elevated contributions to fully max out your 401(k) without missing out on the employer match throughout the year.
Here's the math. If you divide $16,300 by the additional $867 per pay period that you are contributing, you see it will take 18.8 pay periods to cover the added contributions. To make things easy, we will round down to 18. Through your first 18 pay periods, you will have contributed $18,000, leaving you with six pay periods left in the year and $1,500 still to contribute. That means contributing $250 per pay period through the rest of the year to max out your contribution.
Remember to increase your withholdings again at the start of the next year to repeat the process.
There are lots of different scenarios for how to manage this idea, depending on available income and contribution goals, but the overall idea is the same. By doing a little planning at the start of the year can help make sure you don't miss out on the company benefits you deserve while also maximizing your retirement strategy. Plan your contributions to max out your match while front-loading your investments and you'll improve your chances of growing your 401(k) balance as big as possible.","Welcome to NerdWallet’s Smart Money podcast, where we answer your real-world money questions.
This episode starts with a discussion about how to protect yourself from being tracked by websites and apps that want to use your personal data.
“I have a question about my 401(k) match. I have a goal to max out my 401(k) this year, so I was thinking of increasing my contribution amount early in the year, so that I could max it out early and then have larger paychecks towards the end of the year.
Many companies harvest your personal information to sell for profit, which makes protecting your privacy online a challenge. There is only so much you can do on your own, but those steps are worth taking. Consider disabling location on your devices, or for at least a few of your apps. Try services such as DuckDuckGo, Brave and Firefox, which build privacy into their platforms. Also contact your elected representatives and let them know if you’re concerned about privacy.
When it comes to saving for retirement, investing through a 401(k) is great, especially if you contribute enough to take full advantage of any match your employer offers. Maxing out your 401(k), or contributing the max amount allowed per year, is even better.
If you’re looking to take your 401(k) game to the next level, front-loading may be something to consider. Front-loading a 401(k) helps you get your dollars into the market at the start of the year — allowing you to take advantage of an extra 12 months of growth.
However, front-loading may come with an unexpected cost. You may miss out on some of your employer match, because some retirement plans only match contributions during each pay period that you contribute.
You’re less likely to miss out if your employer offers a true-up provision. In that case, your plan administrator determines how much the company match should have been if you had contributed evenly throughout the year and then contributes the difference the next year. This allows you to receive the same amount of money from your employer match that you would have if you had contributed throughout the year.
Front-loading may be worth considering if you can comfortably do so without becoming financially strapped; your employer offers a true-up provision; and you can remember to check in with your plan administrator. However, contributing at a more regular cadence is fine, too.
Contribute for a match: If you have a 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get your employer match.
Diversify your contributions: Consider having savings in retirement accounts with different tax treatments.
Ask about your specific plan: Front-loading may mean you miss out on your employer match, so talk to your plan administrator before making any decisions.

Liz Weston: Oh, I did. And so, so discouraged. I mean, I know something about privacy, and I know something about how much data is being collected. But once you really get into it, you see why all the privacy experts are such doom-and-gloomers.
Basically, all this data is being sucked up about you and kept in perfectly legal databases. And having all this data means that advertisers not only target you and have their ads follow you from site to site, but they can manipulate people and figure out how to get them to spend more. They're trying to maximize profits so one person will spend much more than someone else. People who are struggling financially are getting targeted by predatory lenders and other seedy companies.
And then if there's any kind of database breach, suddenly all these bad actors are buying up your information for a buck or two and using it to scam you, to impersonate you. It's really pretty awful.
Sean Pyles: Yeah. Well, a lot of companies are interested in taking your information to essentially manipulate you.
Sean Pyles: These companies know you better than you know yourself in some way because they're understanding how you're engaging with an app, the amount of time you're spending on it, the way you are navigating through it. And then they can use that information to try to sell you things or suck you further into their platform.
Liz Weston: Yes, and it's being used in politics on both sides of the aisle. We're really only starting to understand how this is working, but no matter what your politics, they're being used against you to manipulate you. So there's a whole lot of reasons to be worried and discouraged.
Sean Pyles: And a whole lot of reasons to maybe just put your phone down and go for a walk in nature every once in a while. That sounds kind of nice.
But now that we are pretty acquainted with the risks of having our information tracked, what can we do to limit this?
Liz Weston: Well, fortunately, there are some real and significant ways that you can get back a little bit of your privacy, and a lot of them have to do with location tracking.
A few years ago, there's this wonderful article that The New York Times did that basically took what was supposedly anonymous data and tracked down the individuals involved, like children being tracked to schools and then after-school activities. And there's a woman who was a nurse going to her hospital and then a doctor’s visit and other places. So that's all a little bit scary, and really it's none of anyone's business where you're going.
And it's fairly easy to turn off the location tracking. You don't have to turn it off for all your apps; some of them are not going to work, like Google Maps, if you turn that off. But a lot of them do.
And basically just try it out. I mean, see what breaks and what doesn't. If it does ""break"" — if it won't work without your location — it will ask you, and you can easily set it back up.
Look at everything that's tracking you and shut down access for the apps that really don't need it.
Sean Pyles: And sometimes you'll be really surprised by which apps, that have nothing to do with your location, do want to know where you are and when.
I have this bad habit of, whenever I have a flight, I'll download like three dozen games on my phone just to occupy me when I'm in the air. And, every so often, I'll go into that privacy part of my phone — location tracking part of my phone — and I will see that some of these games are following me around and, as you described, selling my information.
So that, for me, is always very alarming. And it makes me just want to delete all the games and the apps that I'm not actively using on my phone.
Liz Weston: Yeah, I think a lot of those games — that's their primary purpose is to suck up data about you.
If you have an iPhone, by the way, and you've updated to iOS 15, check out something called the “App Privacy Report.” Basically, turn it on and let it run, and you will be amazed at which apps are tracking you and the kind of data that they're picking up about you.
We need to be constantly checking our privacy settings to make sure that they haven't been turned back on.
And that was something else the privacy experts mentioned — is that for these apps and websites to keep shooting requests at you, it's really easy to click on something just to make that pop-up go away. And then you might have answered it correctly and protected your privacy 35 times. Once in your rush, you're going to accidentally give it permission, and then everything's turned back on. So you have to constantly be vigilant about these kind of things.
Sean Pyles: One thing that stood out to me in your column as well is the idea of personalized ads, and how it's sold to us as something that is beneficial. And, in fact, I think fewer personalized ads in front of us is a greater thing for our budgets. Because that means that we are not being as actively manipulated by the companies that know us, again, better than we know ourselves.
Liz Weston: Yeah, I don't think personalized ads is something I care about, so I try to turn it off wherever.
Also, if you have a Gmail account — any kind of Google account, YouTube, whatever it is — you also want to turn off Google's location tracking. And I give some instructions for how to do that, for exactly the reason that you're talking about.
If you see those ads following you around the internet, that means way too much information's being sucked up about you. So you want to turn off the location tracking and also wipe your search and your app history from your Google accounts.
And again, the settings are there. They're not that hard to find; you click through a few screens. But shutting that down is super important.
Sean Pyles: I'm also a big fan of ad-blocker extensions on my browsers because of exactly that. Well one, ads are annoying.
But two, I am a sucker for an ad in a moment of weakness, where I'm like, ""Oh, well, that actually does seem kind of nice. Maybe I will buy it, because it's being advertised to me on every website that I go to."" And I've fallen for it more than once.
So it's just a good reminder to set up some safeguards for yourself, so that you don't fall prey to these things.
Liz Weston: And speaking of safeguards, an additional one is to switch the browser that you're using. Switch to Firefox, to Brave, to DuckDuckGo. Those were not built to suck up information about you; they were actually built with privacy in mind.
Sean Pyles: I will say they are not all created equal, though. I've used a couple of these over the years, and some I found had really wonky search results. Others seemed pretty good, but every so often I'll run into a website that doesn't quite function as well as it would on a Safari or a Chrome, for example.
So I think that these are absolutely worth adopting, but maybe doing a little bit of research to see which one works best for you.
Liz Weston: Yeah, exactly. I've defaulted to DuckDuckGo. Every once in a while, though, I have to switch back to Google or Chrome to do something.
Try them out, see how they work for you. But again, these were built with privacy in mind, rather than getting all the data possible about you.
Sean Pyles: You also talk in your article about how there is only so much we as individual consumers can do. But one of the best actions we can take as individuals is actually to let our lawmakers know that we care about privacy.
Liz Weston: Yes, exactly. We are not in the European Union, which does have a right to privacy. And it's clearly something that is needed going forward, because there is very little that we can do to protect most of our privacy. What I've been talking about will protect a chunk of it, but not protect everything that needs to be protected.
So if you care about privacy at all — if you've been out there and seen some of the information that's being collected about you — I think you will want to reach out to your lawmakers and say, ""Hey, let's do something about this.""
Sean Pyles: Always great advice. Well, before we move on to this episode's money question segment, we have a callout for all of the parents that listen to Smart Money, and we know there are a lot of you. We are working on a new series about the cost of child care, and we want to know: How are you paying for childcare? Where does it fit in your budget? And have you had to make other sacrifices to make these costs work?
Leave us a voicemail on the Nerd hotline at 901-730-6373, or email a voice memo to podcast@nerdwallet.com, and tell us how you are making child care costs work for you and your family.
Liz Weston: Great. Well, I think we can get on to the money question.
Listener: I have a question about my 401(k) match. I have a goal to max out my 401(k) this year, so I was thinking of increasing my contribution amount early in the year, so that I could max it out early and then have larger paychecks towards the end of the year.
My question is regarding the match. Since 401(k) contribution limits are based on what I contribute and not what my employer contributes, if I max everything out what I'm allowed to contribute and then I can no longer contribute from my paycheck, will I be missing out on the employer match for the second half of the year, if I max it out early? Let me know. Thanks.
Liz Weston: All right. To help us discuss this question, we're joined by investing Nerd, Alana Benson.
Sean Pyles: Alana, our listener is clearly excited about maxing out their 401(k). But for folks who may not know, Alana, can you talk a little bit about the basics of a 401(k)?
Alana Benson: Absolutely. So, 401(k)s are great. They are employer-sponsored retirement plans, and they usually come with a pretty sweet benefit, which is the employer match. That's just when your employer matches what you contribute.
So, if your plan offers a 4% match, that means that as long as you contribute 4% of your salary, your employer will also match that 4%. And for just easy math’s sake, if you make $100,000 a year, and your employer matches 4%, as long as you put in $4,000 (or 4%), your employer will also kick in $4,000. That means that you get $8,000 total but you only have to pay for half of that.
Sean Pyles: It's basically free money.
Alana Benson: It's free money. It's awesome.
Sean Pyles: You don't get that often. All right. And what exactly does maxing it out mean when it comes to your 401(k)?
Alana Benson: So 401(k)s have contribution limits set by the government, which means that you can only put in a certain amount each year. You can't just put in however much you want. The 2022 401(k) contribution limit is $20,500, and those 50 or older can contribute up to $27,000.
So if you're trying to max out your 401k, that just means you're contributing the maximum amount for that year. Your employer's contribution does not actually count towards that personal max for you.
Liz Weston: One thing I've heard from people is they get confused about vesting with a 401(k). When we're talking about company matches, sometimes you don't get access to all that money right away; it takes some time.
And the good news is that the money you put in, you always have access to. In other words, if you put in $5,000 and you leave that company, you get to take that $5,000 with you. How much of the company match you get to take might depend on their vesting rules.
Sean Pyles: OK, and that's typically determined based on how long you spend at the company.
Liz Weston: Yeah. Vesting just means you get a right to the money over time, so there you go.
The other thing we should always mention is that we're not investment or financial advisors and what we're talking about is for general informational purposes only.
Sean Pyles: Thank you for that disclaimer, Liz.
Sean Pyles: So our listener seems to have a pretty clever plan for maxing out their 401(k), by front-loading contributions early in the year, and then reducing their contributions once they hit that maximum contribution amount.
That inevitably means that their paychecks will be smaller at the beginning of the year and then larger at the end of the year. Can you do that, Alana?
Alana Benson: Yeah. So I'll caveat that by saying that whether or not you can front-load a 401(k) will depend on your particular employer. So some might allow it; others might not. But if you can front-load, it will allow your money to get into the market faster, which means it will have longer to grow, which is a good thing.
And our listener alluded to the one downside, which is that your paychecks will definitely feel the difference when you're front-loading, so definitely be sure to do the math first and figure out if you can actually afford to front-load.
Sean Pyles: This also sounds suspiciously similar to timing the market. Is that going on here at all?
Alana Benson: I wouldn't say this is timing it. You know, timing it is going to depend on looking at the market and saying, ""Oh, this is what's happening in the world today, so I bet right now it's a better time for me to put money in than a year from now.""
But if you get your money in a year ahead of time, you know, over 30 years — if that's how long you have until retirement — it probably won't make that big of a difference. But it is still getting your money in a year ahead of time, and so you get an extra year of growth. But I wouldn't categorize this as timing the market. It's more just taking advantage of that extra 12 months of growth.
Sean Pyles: That makes sense.
Liz Weston: So our listener is mainly worried about whether or not they'll miss out on that critical employer match, since they won't be contributing from their paycheck for the second half of the year. Is that a concern they should have?
Alana Benson: So this will really depend on each person's 401(k) plan, kind of like I mentioned. Some plans will only match contributions during each pay period that you contribute, so every time you get a paycheck. And in that case, you actually would be missing out on some of your matching dollars, which is something that we definitely want to avoid.
But some 401(k) plans have what's called a true-up provision. And this means that at the end of the year, the planned administrator will determine how much the company should have matched you, if you had contributed evenly throughout the year. And then the company will then just contribute the difference the next year.
So, really, it will just depend on your plan. Talk to your administrator and specifically ask about their policies on front-loading so that you don't miss out on your match.
Sean Pyles: OK. And, you know, I'm thinking that our listener’s plan could be a pretty savvy way to front-load their 401(k) contributions.
But I'm also beginning to see some potential trade-offs — one of which you just alluded to, which is the added administrative work of changing your contributions, making sure your employer will even allow you to do this. And all of that administrative overhead sounds like more work than I personally am willing to go through.
What do you guys think about any other trade-offs?
Alana Benson: Well, the added administrative work is definitely something, because we're human. We're not perfect, and so if you want to do this, it means you need to be in the driver's seat. You need to check in with your administrator. Maybe the next year you need to follow up if you don't see that true-up provision coming through, if you don't see that money coming back to your account.
So that means you'll just really have to be on the ball and take accountability for your own money. And for some people, that's second nature. But if that's something that you struggle with, it might not be worth it if you forget to let your administrator know to pay you the rest of your employer match.
Alana Benson: And it could also make managing a budget more difficult because your net pay will just change depending on how much is actually being contributed.
And then, obviously, the big one: If you do actually miss out on matching dollars — if your plan doesn't have this true-up provision — I mean, as we said, this is free money; you don't want to miss out on it.
Sean Pyles: And one thing that could be a potentially controversial take is that maxing out a 401(k) isn't actually the best use of someone's money. You might not be able to multitask and meet other financial goals.
If you're shoveling all of your money into a 401(k), you may not be able to build up a down payment on a house. And if all of your money is going into this one retirement account, that might prevent you from contributing to something like a Roth IRA that has a different tax structure that could help you in retirement.
Alana Benson: You just want to make sure that you have enough money to live your life. You know, if you're doing everything you can to maximize what you can do with your 401(k), that's one thing. But if it's creeping into the rest of your life and making it so that you don't have room in the budget for other things, that might be something to consider, too.
Liz Weston: Well, I'll make the argument from the other side. Especially if you're younger and you can do this, maximizing your retirement contributions early on gives you so much more flexibility later on. The earlier you get that money in, as Alana said, the more it can grow.
And it just gives you more freedom to take a sabbatical, stay home when you have kids, do all kinds of other things — maybe even retire early. So I get that you don't want to put all your money into retirement, but I like the idea of maximizing where you can.
Alana Benson: Yeah, it's all a balance.
Sean Pyles: Yeah. And I think there are ways to balance your 401(k) contributions with other retirement contributions to help you really max out what you're contributing, but doing it in a really savvy way. Some financial advisors will recommend that you contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match, and then moving other funds that you would contribute into a Roth IRA or something like an HSA.
Liz Weston: We constantly talk about this, but it's really important to have money in different tax buckets when you get to retirement, because that really helps you manage your tax bill.
If you put all your money into pre-tax vehicles like the 401(k), all of your withdrawals are going to be taxable, and there's also required minimum distributions that can mess you up and throw you into a higher tax bracket.
Anyway, the bottom line is: You do want money in different tax buckets if you possibly can, and that's why advisors suggest doing it this way.
Alana Benson: Yeah. The one caveat I'll make to that, too, is that obviously that's a different situation if you have a Roth 401(k) because then you are getting that tax advantage in the form of your 401(k) as well.
Liz Weston: Yeah, good point.
Sean Pyles: Another thing that folks might want to consider is contributing to an HSA. It's a health savings account that allows you to invest directly from the account and use that money also for health-related expenses.
HSAs offer a triple tax advantage, which means that the contributions are tax-deductible; growth is tax-free; and distributions are tax-free when used for a qualified medical expense.
Liz Weston: Right. And they're different from FSAs, which are also a way to save for medical expenses, in that you can roll the money over from year to year. This is what allows you to be able to invest.
Sean Pyles: Yeah, and for listeners who have not checked it out, we actually recorded an episode with Alana about exactly this subject, so check that out in our archives. Alana, do you have any other thoughts around maxing out retirement contributions?
Alana Benson: The most important thing is just contribute. It's maybe stressful to hear about people maxing out their accounts and you think, ""Oh, wow, I'm really far away from doing that.""
That doesn't matter; just contribute. And maybe if you don't have the means to contribute to get your employer match, just work up to that. There's nothing to feel bad about, and just remember that where you're at is OK and that saving for retirement at any rate is a good rate.
Sean Pyles: And the sooner, the better. I talk with some friends who are a little on the fence about this sometimes. And I try to convince them that the earlier you do it, the more time you have for these funds to grow, the more time you have to take advantage of compound interest.
And you will thank yourself later on. You'll have less to catch up on down the road.
Sean Pyles: Well, Alana, thank you so much for talking with us today.
Alana Benson: Thank you for having me.
Sean Pyles: Now let's get on to our takeaway tips. First up, contribute for a match. If you have a 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get your employer match.
Liz Weston: Next, diversify your contributions. Consider having savings in retirement accounts with different tax treatments.
Sean Pyles: Lastly, ask about your specific plan. Front-loading may mean you miss out on your employer match, so talk with your plan administrator before making any decisions.

1.0,"Zenefits has made waves since day one. It disrupted the HR software market right from its launch, showing small businesses that they could save a ton of time and money by automating manual processes.
Even better, Zenefits doesn’t take years to set up, require a huge amount of training, or mean massive upheaval for your business.
Despite a few blips along the way, Zenefits remains a market leader and continues to push boundaries, such as with its offering of free payroll for a year.
However, that doesn’t mean it’s perfect, and it may not be right for your business. This article looks at Zenefits’ competition and explains what other HR solutions have to offer.
No piece of software is perfect. Even a solution as strong as Zenefits has its weaknesses. Here we’ll explore the features and functionality you should look for in Zenefits’ main competitors.
HR is a data-driven business function. Trying to manually track HR metrics using pen and paper or a spreadsheet is time-consuming and error-prone.
That’s why you need to look for an HR solution that not only collects all of your data, but also centralizes it in one place, so you can glean insight into company and employee performance.
Look for competitors of Zenefits that have built-in reports you can run with the click of a button, plus the option to create your own custom reports for your specific business needs.
Right now you might need only basic HR functionality, but what about a year from now? You need HR software that can grow with your business. Look for an HR solution that has multiple pricing plans so you can upgrade (or downgrade) when your needs change.
Or, look for HR software that has add-ons or integrations that let you expand its functionality as you grow.
If you’re managing a small business, you don’t have weeks to get up and running. You can’t afford the downtime, and you can’t afford to pay for days of training to get employees up to speed with a new software product.
You need an intuitive, easy-to-use solution that doesn’t require formal training or constant reference to a manual.
Also, look for HR software that has a familiar look and feel to consumer solutions so it feels like you're using the latest technology rather than an outdated tool.
The HR software market is crowded with solutions. It can be difficult to wade through all of the options (and promises) to find the software that's right for your business. Here, we look at what Zenefits’ biggest competitors have to offer.
If you’re a startup, Zenefits might have features you won’t use -- at least until your business grows. And you don’t want to pay for features you don’t need.
Zoho People offers a free plan for up to five users that provides basic HR functionality, such as time and attendance, an employee database, document management, and reporting. This makes it an attractive solution for startups and small businesses on a limited budget.
As your business grows, you can move up to one of the four paid pricing plans, which start at $1/month, per user. This gives you the option to add extra functionality, such as onboarding and performance management, in line with your business’s needs.
If you’re looking for HR software that can grow with your business, ADP Workforce Now is a great option. Its modular approach means you pay only for the features you need, and you can add more functionality as your business grows.
This helps you identify areas where you're overspending -- such as overtime pay -- and take actions to address the issues, such as automating manual processes or improving the way you run your operations.
You can also view this data by location and benchmark your results against your competitors to see how you stack up.
ADP Workforce Now has some interesting employee management features, such as its integration with Slack and Microsoft Teams. Your employees can see their vacation balances and submit time-off requests directly from these productivity platforms rather than logging in to the ADP portal.
Some HR solutions, while packed with great features, lack user-friendly workflows and sport outdated designs. This becomes a bigger issue as digital natives enter the workforce and expect their work systems to be on par with the technology they use in their personal lives.
Namely’s modern user interface and dashboard borrows from social media apps such as Facebook. Its Newsfeed draws attention to company announcements, and the layout allows users to quickly access different HR functions from the left-hand menu.
Users can get up and running without needing to complete hours of training or pore over a user manual.
Namely is also a good all-around HR software. It offers a broad range of features, covering recruiting, onboarding, performance management, time and attendance, and benefits administration, all of which are easy to use and understand.
Bamboo HR is a straightforward, intuitive piece of software. Suitable for small businesses that don't have the resources to run a dedicated HR department, it provides hiring, workforce management, and reporting functionality.
You can also choose to add on functionality on a per-module basis, including performance management, time tracking, and employee satisfaction.
Bamboo HR has a well-organized and easy-to-use dashboard that clearly highlights important company information. It’s easy to find your way around and quickly complete common tasks such as managing job openings, accessing reports, and requesting time off.
It also provides a seven-day free trial, so you can try before you buy.
If you work at a startup or small business, you’ll often have to take on responsibilities that are far outside your wheelhouse. This includes recruiting.
If you don’t have the budget for a dedicated hiring manager, then the responsibility for sourcing and managing talent will land on the shoulders of whoever has time. That’s when you’ll realize the value of an applicant tracking system like Workable.
Workable’s intuitive and modern user interface makes it easy to create job ads, even if you’ve never done it before. It provides suggestions -- for example, in finding the right words to use -- that help you quickly create more effective ads.
Its functionality also helps you better promote your vacancies by targeting the right audience according to criteria such as location or whether it’s a remote job, while Workable’s artificial intelligence capabilities help you more quickly source top talent.
While all businesses want to spend the minimum amount of time managing their HR departments, some companies have complex human resources needs. That’s when a solution like Workday HCM comes into play.
Workday HCM has a vast array of features covering the entire human resources spectrum. This ranges from workforce management and planning and recruitment to performance management, compensation and benefits administration, and payroll.
Workday HCM also helps your HR professionals play a more strategic role in the way your business operates. It provides an overview and a detailed breakdown of the performance of both employees and the business as a whole.
Its comprehensive dashboard displays easy-to-digest visual representations of factors that influence the smooth running of any workforce. This includes the cost of your freelance workforce, your progress toward diversity targets, and your succession planning achievements.
Before ruling Zenefits in or out, you need to think about what you need now as well as what you’ll need in the next few years. Draw data from your staffing plan and organizational goals to help you decide what features are must-haves, which are nice-to-haves, and which you can live without.
Then head over to our HR software review pages where you can get more in-depth information on each solution, such as pricing, support, features, and ease of use.
Karen McCandless covers email marketing software for The Ascent, and specializes in business communications and tech.","You’ll make many decisions over the life of your business, one of which will likely be the type of small-business HR software you’re going to use. Zenefits is a popular platform, but there are great alternatives to Zenefits, too.
All of these different platforms excel in certain areas. Some are more tailored to people management, while others are better at payroll. Some have it all — though you might have to make other trade-offs along the way, such as within ease-of-use or price. Ultimately your best option will be the platform most suited to your unique business needs.
Zenefits is among the most popular platforms for small businesses to manage their HR, benefits, payroll and more. If you’ve spent any time with Zenefits reviews, then you know that the platform is well-liked — packed full of features as well as priced competitively.
Multiple pricing tiers for businesses of varying sizes (between $10 to $27 per employee per month, with a discount for buying yearly instead of monthly).
Add-on library for extra customization.
Good at automating onboarding and offboarding tasks, as well as regulatory and compliance tasks.
Offers both a benefits-management portal and a comprehensive payroll portal.
Among the strongest mobile apps available, with integration into tools including G Suite, Salesforce, Asana and more.
Easy-to-shop-for benefits on the platform.
Competitive pricing, but on the higher end of some Zenefits competitors.
May not be as intuitive to use for some.
Customer service can be hit or miss.
Another well-loved HR software provider is Gusto. If you’re looking for an intuitive experience that’s easy to use and well designed, then Gusto is right in your sweet spot.
Gusto’s strength is its payroll management (something that comes as an add-on in Zenefits) for both staff and contract employees. The platform seamlessly manages check payments, direct deposits and tax filings, and you can connect it to many of the most common business accounting software platforms to keep you organized. It also is well-designed for easy onboarding, with features including e-signing and ways to manage commuter benefits, retirement plans and more.
Like Zenefits, Gusto has tiered pricing. The first tier - Gusto Core - costs $40 per month, plus $6 per employee per month, and is more focused on these payroll tasks. To get the comprehensive HR-management platform from Gusto, you’ll need to opt into a higher tier. If you only handle contract employees, you can opt into Gusto’s newest option for $6 per employee with no base price.
Health-benefits administration isn’t available in every state with Gusto, so make sure that your state is among the ones it services if you’re going to use it as a benefits portal.
For those who want powerful payroll management with their HR software, Paychex Flex should be a consideration among the Zenefits competitors. Paychex is one of the stalwarts in the space, which means it has a strong track record of delivering a great product to many different companies.
Paychex Flex is a very scalable service with well-regarded customer service. You can use Paychex Flex to manage your payroll and do a few HR tasks, too, such as benefits administration. There’s also the option to expand the type of HR services that your business runs through the platform (though, of course, this will affect the cost). One drawback that some users have noted is that the platform isn’t as easy to use as some others, including Zenefits.
Paychex Flex also has a few different tiers of pricing, but you’ll need to reach out to the company to find out exactly what you’ll be paying, since it operates on a quote-based pricing model. All tiers include 24/7 support should you need it.
Another close Zenefits competitor for those who are looking for a strong people-focused platform is BambooHR. It’s an excellent platform for streamlining your HR operations, including onboarding and offboarding, vacation management, paperwork and more. A huge strength of BambooHR is its hiring focus: You can post jobs, track applicants and customize your hiring process directly through the platform.
BambooHR does not handle small-business payroll out of the box; instead, you’ll need to opt for an add-on that exports data to a third-party payroll system. So, if taking control of your payroll is your top priority, BambooHR won’t be for you.
Users love BambooHR due to the platform’s ease of use both on the back-end and employee-facing side. And, of course, it’s lauded for those great hiring tools. One of the downsides, however, is that it doesn’t offer upfront pricing like Zenefits; you’ll have to get a quote through BambooHR in order to find out what this software will cost you.
Kronos, which offers HR and benefits management to many major companies, offers a tier called Kronos Workforce Ready, specifically designed for small businesses — think of it as a selectively curated version of the larger platform.
Even though it might sound scaled back, this Zenefits competitor is still packed with features and customization options. In fact, the ability to incorporate add-ons, such as talent acquisition and performance management, makes this one of the most flexible platforms out there. That said, this customization can be a little confusing and overwhelming — so keep that in mind if you’re looking for a quick and easy platform versus something more powerful.
The mobile app here is very strong, too, and the company is well-recognized for staying on top of trends in the HR space.
Before diving in with Kronos Workforce Ready, you’ll need to reach out to the company directly to receive a quote on its pricing — it’s not as straightforward or transparent as Zenefits is. On the bright side, there is a free demo you can request through its website to help you get familiar with the platform before you commit.
Although GoCo isn’t necessarily the best-known platform among Zenefits competitors, it’s among our very favorite HR software for small businesses. It’s very easy to use and straightforward, and its features pack a big punch — especially for its competitive pricing. There’s also an ability to customize the way you use the platform, but it doesn’t make getting down to business confusing.
You can use GoCo for employee paperwork, time management and benefits administration. GoCo is unique with its network of benefits advisors who can help with the (inevitable) support you’ll need as you go through benefits admin. Keep in mind that you can’t do payroll entirely with GoCo, but it’ll sync with existing payroll software (there’s a small additional fee).
A big bonus is that there’s a free version that’s relatively robust, but look into the paid versions, too, since you’ll get more features and integrations that can really help save you time. There’s no free trial here, but you can ask for a demo — or you can sign up for the free version to test drive the software for yourself.
Not everyone has international needs, but if your business is among those working with employees around the globe, CezanneHR could be a good fit for you. This platform helps you through all of the varying international compliance regulations and laws, no matter where your employees are.
With CezanneHR, you’ll pick the platform modularly, meaning that you’ll choose what kind of functionality you use. For instance, you could opt into payroll management, performance management, recruitment and more.
As you might expect, this kind of functionality comes at a premium; although you’ll need to get a quote directly from CezanneHR to find out how much the platform will run you, you should be prepared to pay on the higher end compared to Zenefits. On the bright side, CezanneHR can handle up to 5,000 employees, so if you’re growth-focused, this scalability is a great thing to keep in mind.
If Zoho sounds familiar, it probably is — Zoho People is by the same people who are behind the popular accounting software Zoho Books.
This platform particularly excels in people management for entrepreneurs looking to manage their workforce: It does a great job keeping track of employee records and paperwork, managing attendance, scheduling shifts and tracking time. You’ll find this particularly helpful if you work with a lot of contractors. Zoho People is employee-centric, instead of being tailored toward an HR manager, so there’s a great employee self-service portal that’ll enable your staff to enter their information on their own.
This Zenefits competitor isn’t quite right for those who are looking to administer benefits to staff members as opposed to tracking individual employees’ information.
You can try out Zoho People with a limited free trial. And, if you’re interested from there, it’s one of the less expensive people management platforms for small businesses. Zoho People is free for up to five users and beyond that, you’ll pay between $9 and $29 per month (if you choose to pay annually you’ll receive two months free).
Remember that, ultimately, the best fit for your small-business HR platform is very personal and completely dependent on what your business needs — not how well it’s working out for someone else. That means that even if a platform sounds like it could be great, you won’t know unless you spend some time in the weeds getting to know the features and determining whether it’s a match for your day-to-day operations.
With that in mind, there are a few ways to help you narrow down your search for your perfect HR management platform.
What’s more important — do you need a robust way to handle lots of employee benefits and track PTO, or are you really hoping for more of a payroll platform? Are you looking into one of these HR platforms because you need to cut down on the amount of time you’re spending on these tasks, or are you just looking to get more organized?
Questions like these are very important for you to ask yourself since some platforms do a better job of addressing certain issues than others. If you’re not sure of the questions you should be asking, take a step back and then walk through your day-to-day with HR, noting both what works and what doesn’t.
Some platforms have a better user experience for employees and enable them to manage more from their employee dashboards. Your business might not be at a place where you need anything like that yet, but keep in mind that there’s a workforce-facing side to most of these platforms, too.
As you’ve probably noticed, many HR platforms are priced per seat — meaning per employee. If you go through a growth period, you might all of a sudden find that you’re paying more for your platform than you expected — or, worse, can even afford. Keep in mind how you’re expecting your company to scale in the coming months or years, which can help you consider not only the features that you need from a platform, but also how much you’re going to end up spending.
One of the best ways to know which of the Zenefits competitors is right for you is to take advantage of any free trials or demos. So many small-business payroll platforms offer free trials for around a month, which means you can really get into the program and give it a try yourself.",Fool,Nerdwallet,,,
1.0,"Despite the country's best efforts, U.S. oil production had been on a steady decline for decades. That was until producers found the keys to unlocking the country's vast shale resources, which quickly reversed those declines. In fact, the resurgence of U.S. oil output was so dramatic that it caused oil prices to crash, which unfortunately had recently caused U.S. oil production to start falling again.
U.S. companies that produce and distribute oil and gas.
U.S. companies engaged in the exploration, production, and distribution of oil and gas.
U.S. oil and gas exploration and production.
Data source: iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF, iShares U.S. Energy ETF, and SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production ETF.
The iShares U.S. Energy ETF is a lower risk way to invest in shale because the bulk of its investments are in top-tier U.S. oil companies like ExxonMobil (XOM 0.75%) and Chevron (CVX 0.01%), which are the fund's largest holdings at 23.4% and 13.9%, respectively. While they are among the biggest of big oil, both have large, growing shale businesses. Exxon, for example, recently spent $5.6 billion to double its Permian Basin position, where it was already dominating along with Chevron. In addition, the fund also holds a significant stake in shale-focused driller EOG Resources (EOG 0.26%), oilfield service giants Schlumberger (SLB -0.39%) and Halliburton (HAL -0.85%), pipeline giant Kinder Morgan (KMI -0.43%), and refiner Phillips 66 (PSX 1.23%).
Overall, the fund holds 71 investments. However, its top ten holdings account for 65.7% of the total. Because of the fund's concentrated investments in top-tier energy companies, it has lower risk than other ETFs, which also means that it has less direct upside to resurgent shale.
The iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF is a much more focused bet on the U.S. oil and gas industry. While it does hold several refiners among its top ten, the vast majority of its holdings are E&P companies focused on shale, including ConocoPhillips (COP 0.40%), which is its largest holding at 10.5%. While ConocoPhillips is a global oil company with a balanced portfolio, about a third of its production and the bulk of its future growth is from unconventional shale assets such as the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Permian Basin.
In addition to Conoco, four other shale-focused producers are in the top-ten: EOG Resources, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD 0.93%), Devon Energy (DVN 0.44%), and Concho Resources (CXO). All four companies hold prime positions in the Permian Basin, which they anticipate will fuel double-digit oil production growth over the next several years at current oil prices.
While this fund holds 53 companies, its focus is also at the top. At the moment, its top ten holdings account for nearly 60% of the total. That said, because large shale producers make up the bulk of that top-ten, this fund represents a directional bet on the best-of-breed shale stocks.
The SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production ETF does things a bit differently. Instead of weighting its holdings by the market size of the company, the fund equal weights its holdings. Because of that, it holds roughly the same sized stake in big oil behemoth Chevron as it does in Permian Basin-focused Pioneer Natural Resources and other smaller drillers. As a result, the fund offers investors much more upside potential, especially as smaller shale drillers ramp up output.
That greater upside has been evident over the past year where the fund is up 55% thanks to a significant rally in shale stocks. That's nearly double the return of both the iShares U.S. Energy ETF and the iShares U.S. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production ETF.
However, that higher reward also comes with increased risk because by putting all 63 companies on an equal footing, the fund opens investors up to the likelihood of higher volatility from weaker producers. That has certainly been the case over the past three years, where the fund has returned a negative 17.3% due to the impact of the oil market downturn. Contrast this with a negative 4% return by the iShares U.S. Energy ETF and a negative 6% return by the iShares U.S. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production ETF.
While all three of these energy ETFs should benefit from resurgent shale production, they'll do so to varying degrees due to their different risk profiles. The iShares U.S. Energy ETF, for example, comes with the least direct shale exposure and lowest risk due to its concentration on big oil stocks. Meanwhile, SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production ETF is a higher risk option because it has roughly the same exposure to more than 60 U.S. oil stocks.

When these companies are wrapped in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investors can choose between strategies involving indirect participation, hedged portfolios and direct exposure with high levels of volatility. Three ETFs particularly stand out for using these strategies, should the shale industry rebound, as of March 10, 2016.
Should a recovery in the U.S. shale oil industry occur, the companies that compose the holdings of the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF (NYSE ARCA: XES) should benefit as well. Unlike conventional drilling with rigs that can pump relatively consistent levels of oil for 20 years or more, a typical shale oil well loses about 70% of production in the first year. By the third year, production is reduced to a trickle. The need to replace lost production puts shale oil companies in a constant state of drilling new wells, but with oil's price in the mid-$30s and the break-even price on shale oil being around $50 per barrel, oil producers have slowed the development of new wells.
However, an increase in oil prices to the point where shale oil can be extracted and produced at a profit would likely start a new round of rig construction as companies play catch-up to replace lost production and rebuild their balance sheets. The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF could also benefit from lower shale oil production costs due to improvements in technology. On average, production costs for shale oil dropped from $100 in 2006 to $50 per barrel by the end of 2015 as advances in fracking technology resulted in lower up-front costs and more output per well. The continuation of this trend would lower the break-even point for production costs, resulting in profitable drilling at oil prices lower than $50 per barrel.
The ETF that provides the closest thing to a pure play on shale oil companies is the Invesco S&P SmallCap Energy ETF (NASDAQ: PSCE), which focuses on exploration, production, services and equipment companies in the Standard & Poor’s Small-Cap 600 Index. The fund's largest holding at a 13.8% allocation is PDC Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: PDCE), which has shale oil operations in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and the Utica Field in Ohio. The second-largest position in the fund is Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. (NASDAQ: CRZO) at a 10.01% allocation, which focuses primarily on shale oil operations in Texas, Ohio, Colorado and Pennsylvania.
The portfolio’s exposure to small-cap energy companies in general, as well as shale oil explorers and producers specifically, results in a high-volatility ETF that is not for the faint of heart. For example, the fund's beta is 1.7, meaning it is 70% more volatile than the general market. However, this fund is worthy of consideration for risk-tolerant investors seeking a bet on a U.S. shale industry rebound.
As a market-weighted fund, the Market Vectors Unconventional Oil & Gas ETF (NYSE ARCA: FRAK) concentrates 58.48% of its top 10 holdings in large-cap companies that get a small percentage of revenues from shale oil, and distribute the balance of its holdings over smaller exploration and production companies. For example, the fund’s largest holding is Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY), which operates in three distinct segments: oil and gas, chemicals, and midstream and marketing. The company announced in October 2015 that it was reducing its exposure to shale oil by selling its operations in the Bakken field, located in North Dakota. These operations represented Occidental's largest stake in shale oil.
As a result of its concentrated holdings of large-cap integrated oil positions mixed with small-caps in the oil and gas sector, the ETF offers hedged exposure to shale oil companies, with relatively lower volatility than a portfolio composed entirely of small-cap explorers and producers. For example, its return over 2015 was -34.01%, versus the Invesco S&P SmallCap Energy ETF’s loss of 48.3% during the same period. The performance relationship of these funds is similar on the upside, as the one-month return for the Market Vectors Unconventional Oil & Gas ETF was 17.48%, while the Invesco S&P SmallCap Energy ETF gained 24.41% over the same period.
These ETFs provide investors with three strategies to bet on a rebound for the U.S. shale industry. As an indirect play, the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF will benefit as producers expand their drilling operations. The Market Vectors Unconventional Oil & Gas ETF offers hedged exposure with relatively less volatility. For risk-tolerant investors, the direct and high volatility exposure provided by the Invesco S&P SmallCap Energy ETF will likely deliver the biggest price swings out of these three ETFs, both on the upside and the downside.",Fool,Investopedia,,,
1.0,"Thank you for standing by, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2022 financial results conference call. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that this conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Alexia Quadrani, senior vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead.
Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website.
Joining me for today's call are Bob Chapek, Disney's chief executive officer, and Christine McCarthy, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Walt Disney wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, Disney's employees and cast members continued to execute against our strategic priorities of storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus, and I could not be more proud of what they've achieved. Our strong results this quarter, including fantastic performance at our domestic parks and continued growth at our streaming services along with the creative achievements of our content teams, once again proved that we are in a league of our own. We have entertainment's most iconic brands and the world's favorite franchises, a high-quality creative pipeline that will continue to drive engagement and consumption and an unrivaled synergy machine with touch points that reach audiences across distribution channels, geographies and demographics, all of which come together to create a deep, emotional connection with audiences across generations.
I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter that illustrate these strengths, and then Christine will go through the details of our results. As I said, our domestic parks were a standout. They continue to fire on all cylinders, powered by strong demand coupled with customized and personalized guest experience enhancements that grew per capita spending by more than 40% versus 2019. Response to next-generation storytelling like Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser has been phenomenal.
In fact, guest ratings for this immersive experience, which opened March 1, are incredibly high and in line with our best-in-class offerings. Demand is strong, and we expect 100% utilization through the end of Q3. Looking ahead, we could not be more excited to officially welcome riders on Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at Epcot on May 27. One of the longest indoor rollercoasters in the world, the attraction puts guests in the middle of an exciting adventure as they're called on to help the Guardians out of a jam.
With our first-ever reverse launch and rotating cars that turn riders 360 degrees, guests won't miss a second of the story during our most immersive coaster experience yet. At Disneyland Paris, we are thrilled to take the next step in our ambitious expansion plan: the opening of Avengers Campus this summer as part of the resort's 30th anniversary celebration. As Europe recovers from the pandemic, we've seen strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris and look forward to its continued recovery. Another standout this quarter were our streaming services.
We ended Q2 with more than 205 million total subscriptions after adding 9.2 million in the quarter. That includes 7.9 million Disney+ subscribers, keeping us on track to reach 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by fiscal '24. The growth of the platform since its launch reinforces its unique nature. Quite simply, we believe Disney+ is one of a kind, a service based on exceptional branded content with wide appeal across all four quadrants.
It's certainly popular with families, but as a reminder, almost half of Disney+ subscribers are adults without kids. In recognition of Disney+'s unique ability to attract viewers from a range of demographic groups, we are selectively enhancing Disney+ with general entertainment titles designed to drive sign-ups among specific audiences and deepen engagement among those cohorts. A benefit of our incredible creative engines and decades of general entertainment excellence is that we can reach these demographics not only through the creation of original titles but also by shifting resources from across our content ecosystem, especially as consumer behavior continues to evolve. Our strategy is not just to fill our distribution pipelines but to be thoughtful with each asset to best position it among our various distribution options.
For instance, Dancing with the Stars is a beloved show that has entertained viewers for more than 30 seasons on ABC and is a wonderful example of content that brings the whole family together. We recently announced Disney+ will be the series' new home starting this fall. Beyond targeting specific demos, we are equally enthusiastic about our growth potential in international markets. We currently have over 500 local original titles in various stages of development and production.
180 of those titles are slated to premiere this fiscal year, increasing to over 300 international originals per year in steady state. We believe these premium local originals, along with branded content with broad international appeal, will attract new subscribers and drive engagement. One example in production is Nautilus from our EMEA team. Based on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Nautilus is the origin story of the iconic submarine from the perspective of its mysterious commander, Captain Nemo.
This is just one example of how our global network of creative hubs can develop and produce original content with worldwide appeal. And by the end of we plan to roll out Disney+ to 53 new markets across Europe, Africa and West Asia, starting with South Africa next week. Before leaving Disney+, I want to mention our recently announced plans to introduce an ad-supported subscription offering in the US by the end of the calendar year and internationally in 2023. Expanding Disney+ access through multiple price points is a win for consumers and advertisers.
Of course, all of our success is rooted in great content. Our general entertainment team continued its string of phenomenal series with Hulu's Pam & Tommy and The Dropout. And while not in the quarter, we could not be happier with the performance of The Kardashians, more great general entertainment content is ahead, like the second season of Only Murders in the Building on Hulu and the record-breaking 19th season of ABC's Grey's Anatomy. This quarter, our studios earned six Academy awards, including Best Animated Feature for Walt Disney Animation Studios, Encanto, and Best Documentary Feature for Onyx Collective and Searchlight Pictures Summer of Soul.
Pixar Animation Studios' Turning Red premiered on March 11 on Disney+ and became the fastest title to reach 200 million hours viewed on the platform. The Disney+ original series Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett drew positive reaction from audiences, and Marvel's Moon Knight continue the studio's impressive track record. Looking ahead, our studios will continue to deliver high-quality content at scale with an exciting array of series and films coming to all of our distribution channels. In fact, our slate for the remainder of this year is incredibly strong with titles like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ms.
Marvel, Lightyear, Thor: Love and Thunder, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and the long-anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water. Finally, I must mention the phenomenal success of Marvel's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which opened to roughly $450 million worldwide this past weekend. Domestically, it was the second-highest opening of the pandemic era and the 11th highest opening of all time. Our strategy of distribution flexibility has worked well for us, and these fantastic results are another sign of our ability to succeed no matter of the platform.
That success extends to sports. ESPN viewership was notably strong for the quarter across both live events and studio programming with ratings up double digits, and we remain encouraged by how fans are engaging with sports content coming out of the pandemic. Opening weekend of the NBA Playoffs was the most viewed in the past decade, and the ratings have been fantastic with over 4.3 million average viewers through 20 games on ABC and ESPN. Our groundbreaking NHL deal is unique in its exposure across ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, culminating with the Stanley Cup Playoffs, which began on May 2.
In fact, the combination of the NHL and NBA Playoffs going on simultaneously kicks off an exciting stretch of championship programming that also includes Wimbledon, the NCAA Women's and Men's College World Series, UFC, Boxing and more. Coming off the success of Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli, we recently debuted our new season-long MLB alternative broadcast, KayRod Cast with Michael Kay and Alex Rodriguez. And we began the inaugural season of PGA TOUR Live on ESPN+, featuring over 4,000 hours of live golf coverage from 35 tournaments. Before I hand it over to Christine, I want to say a few words about our unique synergy machine or franchise flywheel, if you prefer.
What sets Disney apart is our ability to reach people with our uniquely engaging content across an array of touch points to make our portfolio of businesses and brands a bigger part of their lives. This enables us to not only create new franchises like Encanto, but to also build on existing IP across our lines of business. One example of this is our Toy Story franchise, which was created almost three decades ago with the release of the first film in 1995 and which is now brought to life across distribution platforms, geographies, businesses and time. In our parks, we've built a portfolio of four immersive Toy Story lands with more than 20 attractions and live character interactions available around the world, as well as two themed hotels.
The franchise is the cornerstone of Disney+ with all four feature-length films, as well as the original short series, Forky Asks a Question, exclusively available on the service. And nearly 30 years after the film debuted, Toy Story is still a key consumer products franchise, generating over $1 billion in annual retail sales. And in just a few weeks, Pixar's Lightyear will tell the origin story of everyone's favorite space ranger when it hits theaters on June 17. Of course, Toy Story is just one of our many franchises, but it illustrates our unparalleled ability to bring stories to life in more ways for more people in more places.
In fact, our franchise library and capabilities will continue to set us apart even further as we bring our IP to life through next-generation storytelling that is more integrated and connected across consumer touch points. As we look to our second century, that's our mission: to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger, more connected and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine.
Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter were $1.08, an increase of $0.29 versus the prior year quarter. We continue to be pleased with our financial results with total segment operating income increasing by 50% versus the prior year quarter and by over 80% year-to-date. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment continued to show strong signs of growth and recovery as operating income increased by nearly $2.2 billion year-over-year to approximately $1.8 billion.
Growth was primarily driven by our domestic parks, which were open for the entire quarter. In the prior year, Walt Disney World was open, but Disneyland was closed for the entire quarter. We continue to be pleased with the overall demand and attendance trends at our domestic parks. In fact, there were many days in the quarter where we saw demand exceed 2019 levels.
However, we are continuing to control attendance through our reservation system with an eye on delivering a quality guest experience. As Bob mentioned earlier, per capita guest spending at our domestic parks increased by over 40% versus Q2 of fiscal 2019 and by 20% versus Q2 of fiscal 2021 with increases across the board on admissions, food and beverage and merchandise. Looking ahead to the third quarter. Our forward-looking demand pipeline at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland remains robust.
And while attendance from international visitation is still in the early days of recovery, we are beginning to see some improvements. We are also thrilled that as of the end of March, all of our domestic resorts are now open, a major milestone as we continue to move through the impacts of the pandemic. At our international parks, operating results improved versus the prior year due to growth at Disneyland Paris, which was open in Q2 and closed during the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by lower results at Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disney, both of which were impacted by COVID-related closures in the quarter.
Consumer Products operating income increased in the quarter, reflecting higher sales of merchandise based on several of our iconic franchises, including Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man, Star Wars and Disney Princess. Moving on to the Media & Entertainment Distribution segment. Second quarter operating income decreased by approximately $900 million versus the prior year as revenue growth of about $1.2 billion, primarily driven by direct-to-consumer was more than offset by higher expenses, including programming and production expenses at linear networks and direct-to-consumer, which came roughly in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. At our linear networks business, operating income in the quarter was $2.8 billion or roughly flat versus the prior year as modest growth at our domestic channels was offset by a decline at our international channels.
Domestically, higher operating income at broadcasting was partially offset by lower results at cable. Broadcasting results benefited year-over-year from affiliate revenue growth in addition to higher advertising revenue due to the timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in Q2 this year versus Q3 last year. These impacts were partially offset by higher programming and production costs also driven by the timing of the Academy Awards. At cable, lower operating income versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase in programming and production costs.
The largest component of the increased cost was driven by four additional NFL games versus the prior year, consisting of three regular season games, as well as the return of the Pro Bowl. These impacts were partially offset by growth in cable advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at ESPN increased by over 30% in the quarter, and third quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up significantly benefiting from a return to a pre-COVID NBA schedule that is driving increased viewership and pricing. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 5% in the quarter.
This was primarily driven by seven points of growth from higher rates, partially offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating income at our international channels decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower affiliate revenue and an increase in programming and production costs, partially offset by advertising revenue growth. At direct-to-consumer, operating losses widened to almost $900 million due to higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ and lower operating income at Hulu. The higher losses at our DTC services were largely driven by higher programming and production expenses, in line with what we noted in our guidance last quarter.
At Disney+, programming and production costs grew along with marketing and technology costs to support our growth around the world, partially offset by higher subscription revenue. We ended the quarter with nearly 138 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting close to 8 million net additions from Q1. A little over half of those net adds were from Disney+ Hotstar, which benefited from the start of the new IPL season toward the end of the second quarter. Internationally, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added over 2 million paid subscribers versus the first quarter with Latin America being the strongest contributor, driven by growth of the Combo+ offering.
Domestically, net adds of approximately 1.5 million reflect in part the success of tentpole content releases, including Turning Red and Moon Knight, as well as the strength of our bundled and multiproduct offerings. ESPN+ ended Q2 with 22.3 million paid subscribers, a net increase of about 1 million versus Q1. Operating results decreased compared to the prior year due to higher sports programming costs and lower pay-per-view income, partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, which ended the second quarter with 45.6 million paid subscribers, higher subscription and advertising revenues versus the prior year were more than offset by higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs.
Moving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased by approximately $300 million versus the prior year, driven by lower TV and SVOD results, which we discussed in our guidance last quarter, in addition to a decrease in home entertainment results. As a reminder, these impacts are deliberately aligned with our strategic decision to utilize our content on our own direct-to-consumer services. Before I touch on a few things that we'd like you to keep in mind for the back half of the fiscal year, I'll quickly note two other relevant items for the second quarter.
We recognized a revenue reversal of $1 billion related to the early termination of content licensing agreements with a customer in order to make that content available on our own direct-to-consumer services. Because substantially all of the consideration we received was recognized as revenue at the time that content was originally made available in previous years, we've recorded amounts to terminate the agreement net of remaining amounts of deferred revenue as a revenue reversal. Finally, a note on the impact of some tax-related items on our Q2 EPS. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items of $1.08, includes an adverse impact of approximately $0.11 due to the impact of higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of a recent change in US tax regulations.
It's worth mentioning that while our annual effective tax rate has generally been correlated with the US statutory rate, there are many complex puts and takes in any given period, which can lead to these variances quarter-to-quarter. And we currently expect the full year tax rate could remain somewhat elevated above the US statutory rate. Now, as it relates to the third quarter and the second half of fiscal 2022. At DPEP, closures at our Asia theme parks could adversely impact operating income in the third quarter by up to approximately $350 million versus the prior year.
As a reminder, Hong Kong Disneyland was closed for the first three weeks of the quarter, Shanghai Disney has been closed quarter-to-date, and we do not yet have visibility to a reopening date. As we continue to strategically prioritize leveraging our content for our own services, we expect content sales, licensing and other operating results to decrease in the third quarter by approximately $150 million to $200 million versus the prior year. The expected decrease is primarily driven by declines in content licensing along with a continued decline in home entertainment results. direct-to-consumer programming and production costs in Q3 are expected to increase by more than $900 million year-over-year, reflecting higher original content expense at Disney+ and Hulu, increased sports rights costs and higher programming fees at Hulu Live.
At Disney+, while we still expect higher net adds in the second half of the year versus the first half, it's worth mentioning that we did have a stronger-than-expected first half of the year. Additionally, note that some of the Eastern European markets we're launching in toward the end of Q3, including Poland, are in regions being impacted by geopolitical factors. As it relates to content spend, we previously stated that we expect fiscal year 2022 cash content spend to total as much as $33 billion. We've adjusted that amount to as much as $32 billion to reflect a slightly slower cadence of spending than anticipated during the first half of the year.
Note that we are still expecting a strong content slate in the back half of the year. And as Bob mentioned, we are confident in our long-term subscriber guidance of 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subs by fiscal 2024. We also still expect that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.
Thank you, Christine. We are happy to be back here in person for this call, but to make it easier, I will help direct the questions. [Operator instructions] And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.
Your first question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Yes. Thanks for taking the question. And Bob touched on pricing to some degree during his comments. So I thought we could come back to that.
One of the questions we've been getting is, how do you think about the right cadence for revisiting pricing on Disney+ really when you can take price higher? It just seems like there's a lot of factors that would go into that, including the fact you'll be launching a new ad-supported tier. You're putting a lot more content onto the service. You've seen some increased competition. And obviously, there's some inflationary pressures, and I'm just not quite sure if you put all that to a pot what that yields in terms of how you're thinking about pricing.
All right. Thank you. As you know, we launch with an extremely attractive opening price point on Disney+, and we've been very comfortable with the price-value relationship that we've offered. And as you know, as we increase our content investment, we believe that that's going to give us the ability to adjust our price by -- and still, at the same time, maintain that strong value proposition.
You mentioned the Disney+ ad tier I think this is going to give us the ability to reach an even more broad audience as we expand Disney+ across multiple price points. And using some of our other services, we can see the additive nature of an ad-driven service that enables us to keep the price lower. Of course, that's made up for by the additional revenue that we would get per user on the advertising spending. So we believe that we can sort of move up and cascade up our net price over time given the tremendous value that we started with and the increased price-value relationship of all the new content, but we're pretty bullish about that.
Next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thanks. Good afternoon.  A question and if I can, Alexia, just a clarification from the prepared remarks. On parks, as you know, you'll start to lap some really strong significant double-digit per-capita growth as you move through the rest of the summer and into the fall. And I'm just wondering, particularly given how focused everybody is on the economy and inflation, the consumer, if you're seeing any signs that would suggest that you're going to see substantial deceleration or even maybe not grow your per capita growth at the domestic parks.
Just be curious on how you're thinking about the full year and as you lap these comparisons. And then, I just wanted to come back, Christine, on the second half net adds. Are you still expecting a stronger second half at Disney+ than the first half and you're just calling out that maybe the relative comparison won't be as pronounced? I just wanted to make sure I understood what you -- we understood what you were saying. Thank you.
Bob, why don't you take the first half and then Christine can follow up?
OK. So we continue to see really strong demand, and we're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing, particularly as we're going to get some improvements to international visitation. But we're controlling our attendance, as Christine mentioned in her comments, using our reservation system to optimize the guest experience. But that domestic yield strategy, and we're also seeing it in Paris, is really exceeding our expectations.
If you remember, last quarter, we mentioned that we had some high hopes for it, but we were seeing well above what we had anticipated. Well, I'm happy to say that in Q2 we're even, as you say, we're lapping those numbers again even higher. So we're very, very encouraged by the continuation of the trends that we're seeing in terms of the number of people. For example, that sign-up for Genie+, plus the willingness to come to our parks with our balanced reservation system, which really helps us sort of manage our price per day, if you will.
So that domestic yield strategy has really structurally allowed us to increase that per-capita spending meaningfully without having to rely solely on raising ticket prices, and we don't see any end in sight for that.
Great. Ben, your question on net adds for the second half of the year. We still do expect an increase over the first half. However, the first half came in better than expected, so that delta that we had initially anticipated may not be as large.
But we still do expect an increase in the second half to exceed the first half.
Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Thank you. I have two. First would be, Bob, it seems that the equity markets are now focused on, kind of, the cost to achieve subscriber growth and maybe not just focused on the sub numbers as much as the cost to achieve. So I wonder, given the rising content costs you're seeing in things like sports and competition around the globe, how do you measure maybe the need to drive shareholder returns versus attaining those sub targets that were laid out in 2020? And how do you -- and how and when will you determine what the ROIC would be on maybe the next 100 million subs versus the first 100 million subs? And then, Christine, can you talk a bit about any type of incremental margins at the parks? Very strong so far, halfway through the year.
Any type of inflation on the parks that could limit maybe the margin growth we've seen at this point? So thanks.
So as you know, we're very carefully watching our content growth -- content cost growth. And we reaffirmed, as you heard earlier, our targets, our guidance on both subs and on profitability. So we think they move together. It's obviously a balancing act, but we believe that great content is going to drive our subs, and those subs then in scale will drive our profitability.
So we don't see them as necessarily counter. We see them as sort of consistent with the overall approach that we've laid out. We're extremely happy with the content that we've got both across the general entertainment option, which frankly is -- you heard that 50% of our subs are families without kids. And so, at the same time, that relative content expenditure is a little cheaper than our typical franchise expenditure on a per-program basis.
So even though we're adding a lot of content both in local, international markets and as well in the general entertainment area, it doesn't come at the per-title level, if you will, that we've been seeing sort of to date on our general franchise films. That said, we're balancing all three. And we're very confident that going forward, we're going to hit both of those sub guidance and profitability guidance by bringing in the cost at a reasonable level relative to their ability to attract and retain our subs.
Hi, Michael. On the parks margins, as Bob said, we feel really good about the consumer demand and what we're seeing in the forward-looking bookings and everything else in the attendance levels. So we feel good about that portion of margins. The one that is more challenging is what we face with inflation.
But we do pay close attention to all the recent inflationary pressures, and it covers everything from merchandise to food and beverage. I'll give you an example of something -- for those, we are actually always looking at mitigating impacts of rising costs. But I'll give you a good example of one that we are executing on, and that is the increased cost in fuel. We have a very robust fuel hedging program at Walt Disney World, and that reduces risk and minimizes volatility, reduces volatility in the cost of fuel.
And so, that -- while we suspended that program while the parks were shut, we have reopened that program and we are doing what we can to minimize the impact on that particular cost. We do have the labor impacts. Rising wages is something everybody is dealing with and a tighter labor market. On the supply chain, our business isn't immune to the global supply chain challenges.
And to the extent we experience any product availability impacts given strong demand that we're seeing, we're working with our suppliers to diversify some of our suppliers, and we're also working with shippers to expedite time to receive those through shipping. But right now, it's very difficult to accurately forecast the potential financial impact due to the fluidity of the situation. But you can trust that we are fully aware of it, and we're working hard to mitigate any pressure on the margins.
From Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Thank you. I have one big question, one multipart. Can you -- with the upfronts coming next week, can you give us some -- any color on how you're thinking about what this year's upfront will be like given changes in measurement, multiple platforms that you're selling across and, of course, the economy? And staying with the theme on -- given your upcoming rollout of the AVOD platform for Disney+, you already have Hulu ad inventory, and as you're adding Disney+, do you think this will grow the pie overall for Disney advertising dollars? Or will this ultimately just drive share shift from traditional broadcast linear? Is it incremental or not? How are you thinking about that? And how much do you think that having an ad-supported service will increase overall TAM for subscribers?
OK. Let's see. I'm going to take the first part first. We're expecting a very positive reaction from advertisers overall.
And as you suggest, this is a combination of our excitement around the Disney+ ad tier. They have been asking for this for years. And we also expect Hulu, as you know, which has been very strong for us at the same time, to be a key contributor of our performance at the upfront this year. The other thing is that sports are going to continue to be in high demand.
And so, with the advertisers, we focused on the right deals that we've made over the past few years, as well as our robust slate of original content shows and studio shows and original content games. In terms of sort of the growing-the-pie idea, we believe that the value proposition of advertising with Disney+ is only enhanced with our addition of an ad-supported tier on Disney+. So we believe it's good for the consumer because it's going to give us another entry price point, but it's also going to be great for the advertisers. Our advertisers increasingly are looking for multiple platforms to reach a broader reach.
And we think that as a company, we're going to provide that given our portfolio of streaming and our linear networks. So I think we're creating more avenues, both for consumer choice and for comprehensive advertising solutions, for our advertising customers at the same time.
From Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Thanks. Just two. Maybe first, Bob, what's holding you back from making ESPN+ a fully a la carte sports network? Disney historically has always been more aggressive in the pivot to streaming than some of the peers. We've already seen some of the peers put a lot of their key sports like the NFL on to streaming.
You talked a lot about how much the bundle is working with Disney+ and Hulu. So just really wondering how you're thinking about all the content you've got on ESPN+ and what it would take to make that fully a la carte and drive the DTC strategy even harder. And then, Christine, I have asked this before, so I'm just going to try again. Of the $32 billion in content spend, any help in sizing maybe how much of that is either general entertainment or local content? Thank you very much.
OK. So as you know, on all of our linear networks, they're huge cash generators for us. So to some extent, we're doing a really good job of chopping down some of the debt that we've had to accumulate due to either acquisition or through the COVID challenge. And so, the hesitancy to move too fast away from those is really a cash flow situation that I think puts our company in a healthier overall situation.
At the same time, we're very conscious of our ability to go more aggressively into the DTC area of ESPN. And so, what we're doing is sort of putting one foot on the dock, if you will, and one foot on the boat right now. But we know that at some point when it's going to be good for our shareholders, we'll be able to fully go into an ESPN DTC offering the way that you described. And we fully believe that there is a business model there for us that's going to enable us to regain growth on ESPN+ in a full DTC expression.
But at that point, obviously, that will have ramifications on immediate cash flow that we get from our legacy linear networks.
OK. Steve, to answer your question on that $32 billion of content spend and where it's going, remember back when we talked about that initially, we talked about it being about one-third in sports. That still remains. And when you think about the balance of that $32 billion, a meaningful amount of it will be enterprisewide content budget that will be dedicated into investments into the general entertainment content that we can leverage across all of our various distribution platforms.
When we say that, we mean linear, theatrical, as well as direct-to-consumer. And as I mentioned earlier, our world-class creative teams are focused on creating content that will drive subscriber growth in targeted segments and deeper engagement across the platform. This includes leveraging our existing intellectual property. Also, we're intent on creating new franchises.
You saw that in Encanto and investing in general entertainment, local language content and sports rights. I just want to -- even though you didn't ask about local language content, I do want to give you some perspective because we haven't provided this previously. But as Bob mentioned, we have about 500 shows in the pipeline for local content outside of the US or English speaking. When you look at that 500, I'll give you some broad breakdowns.
In the Asia Pacific region, including Southeast Asia, of that 500, 140 is in that region. In EMEA, it's 150. In India, it's 100. And in Latin America, it's 200.
Next question is from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Thank you. A couple, if I could. So Bob, first, I guess, when we think about the streaming goal, if we are really looking at 240 million subs at the midpoint, with the new ad-supported streaming service, what proportion of the base do you expect will be on that tier versus normal premium tier, especially given the fact that now you may have to do more than 50 million subs a year to get to that goal given the trend lines for this year? So that would be the first one. And secondly, I don't think Disney has been able to release a movie in China since 2019.
If you could just help us understand what the roadblocks there are and when we could see some change in that process? Thanks.
OK. I'm going to start with China. And the situation there has been very fluid, and as you probably guess, very complicated both from a business standpoint and from a political standpoint. But as you know, we've got a long record of success and a strong fan base for our brands and franchises in this market.
And our most recent releases were Death on the Nile and Encanto. And we'll continue to submit our films for release. And it's worth noting, I think, though, that at the time that we're having some difficulty in getting our films in China that Doctor Strange did extraordinary. We've just crossed $500 million in less than a week without this market.
So we're pretty confident that even without China, if it were to be that we continue to have difficulties in getting titles in there, that it doesn't really preclude our success given the relatively lower take rate that we get on the box office in China than we do across the rest of the world. Christine, do you want to talk about streaming?
Sure. On streaming, right now, we have not disclosed a mix or expected mix of an ad-supported tier. So we don't have any additional details on that product, and that includes pricing as well. But when we expand Disney+ across multiple price points with this new Disney+ ad tier, we are able to reach an even broader audience, and we'll create more avenues for consumer choice.
And this is a consistent theme that you've heard from us, having the consumer be our North Star. We'll continue to evaluate what makes sense for the service, our brand and our core principle of providing consumers with the maximum flexibility and choice. So we expect the advertising revenue we earn will contribute positively to our ARPU as we look to achieve our long-term profitability goals.
Question is from Philip Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
I have a couple of follow-ups, if I can. Thank you. On parks, can you talk about where the parks are -- the US parks are in terms of staffing and cost, as well as the potential for upside or not in those domestic attendance numbers for customers? And then, Bob, if I can go back to your comment on ESPN going all online someday. I think most of us expect us to happen eventually.
Clearly, that will be a huge change in the P&L at both DTC and linear. When that happens, does the overall profitability of the company take a hit for a year or 2? And how does the long-term sports on ESPN+ model work? And what's the structure of that versus what we've seen in the past of a purely linear model? Thanks very much.
Christine, do you want to start with the first question? And then, Bob second.
Sure. On our parks business, we're obviously extremely pleased with our domestic parks operations and how they have come back robustly. But on domestic attendance, we could, but we're choosing to limit attendance using our reservation system. And once again, that goes back to us trying to balance demand and attendance throughout the year, not have days when consumers in the parks aren't enjoying the experience.
So attendance is something that we're controlling, but we're doing it to have a better consumer experience. And some of the things that we've brought back, we will continue to with additional capacity. But some capacity that we just brought back in April were things like the character meet-and-greets at our domestic parks. And we also brought back in April our Nighttime Spectaculars at the Disneyland Resort.
And we'll also be opening a new attraction at Walt Disney World, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at the end of this month on Memorial Day weekend, and that is all new capacity, and we're really looking forward to having our guests experience that.
OK. And on the ESPN question, we're not ready to share the specifics of our model in terms of how long it would take for us to reach profitability on that or the impact that it would have on our linear business. But I would emphasize that we're only going to do it if it's accretive to our shareholder value when it comes time to actually pull the trigger. But I can tell you that it will be the ultimate fan offering that will appeal to super fans that really love sports.
And I think there's nobody but ESPN that, frankly, could actually pull that off. But we don't have a lot of specifics when it comes to structure. But we do believe that because sports is so powerful, in fact, in the last quarter, 46 of the top 50 most viewed programs on linear TV were sports. And obviously, ESPN dominates that.
And I do believe that sports is the third leg of our domestic offerings in terms of our DTC offerings, and right now, that expression is through the bundle. And I think that could become very powerful for us going forward in the future.
From Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Thanks so much for taking the question. So I guess two questions, if I could. Bob, you've continued to suggest a lot of confidence in Disney+ guidance. Can you talk about trends for churn and engagement for Disney+? And I'm not sure if you're willing to share how much of Disney+ viewing is new content versus library, just thinking as more and more new content starts to show up and ramp.
And then, separately, and maybe this is for Christine, Alexia, you'll let me know. But I'm just curious what you think the international fee park margin potential because it peaked at 16% in fiscal '19. I think we're getting a pretty good idea that the domestic theme parks is going to be very, very profitable. But international is still a bit of a mystery.
I know you've got some parks closed and there's some disruption, but you also have a good idea of what you're seeing in the US, how you could apply that overseas and what you've done with the cost structure during the pandemic. And also, if you look back at fiscal '19, sorry for making the question a little bit longer, but Hong Kong was shut down for part of the year; China was, what, in year three. So I'm just curious if those international margins, do we think about the getting closer and closer to US margins over time? Thanks so much.
Bob, why don't you take the first half and then Christine can follow up on parks.
OK. In terms of our confidence in Disney+ guidance, as you probably know, we have a tremendous amount of data that we get on our DCC platforms, things like the first view, what's the first view that somebody watches when they first come on to our platform, which is a pretty good proxy for maybe why they signed up. There's also the amount of time spent, the engagement scores and then, of course, the churn, information that you sort of look at. And we've said this before in past earnings calls, but we're extraordinarily pleased with the low churn that we see, particularly given the bundle.
The bundle is really efficient in terms of churn. And that gives us a lot of bullishness when it comes to the idea of bigger offerings from Disney. So as we sort of take each of these elements, when we get a new piece of content, we'll look at first view, we'll look at engagement, we'll look at the amount of time they spend on it. And we can model.
We can do a lot of modeling. And that modeling suggests that in addition to things like local market content, new content coming online, both in terms of general entertainment and from franchises, as well as new markets being added that that Disney+ guidance is going to be very achievable for us both in terms of the sub adds and in terms of the operating performance.
OK. On international theme parks, Doug, on Asia, I think it's really too early for us to tell. And as you heard in my comments, we said that we could see a negative impact of Hong Kong and Shanghai of $350 million in the next quarter, so just keep that in mind. But it is a bit of a tale of two cities.
I can give you some very positive trends we're seeing out of Disneyland Paris. So just like domestically, we're seeing very strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris. And we're looking forward to its continued recovery, particularly with the recent launch of their 30th anniversary celebration. Avengers Campus, that's the first new themed area of our multiyear expansion that we've talked about previously for DLP, that will open this summer.
And what has already opened is the -- one of our large hotels over there, the New York Hotel, has been rethemed in a Marvel theme and Avengers theme. So that's very exciting. And our guests love staying there. So I think what we're seeing in Paris gives me hope.
Hope is not a strategy, but it gives me hope that our other parks in Asia will see that same rebound when their COVID-related headwinds abate.
If I could just follow up, maybe the simple way to put it is, you've talked about the potential for higher park margins than previous peak. Would that apply to both domestic parks, and separately, international parks longer term?
Well, Doug, we've said it for domestic. We're not going to update that for international. There's just too much uncertainty with the region in Asia that has two of our parks right now.
All right. Thanks so much.
Operator we have time for one more question.
Thank you. From Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. I have a couple on this advertising tier we're talking about for Disney+. My first is, can you share anything else on what remains to be done prior to the rollout, the implementation of that advertising tier? Are there assets you need to acquire? Or what are you building or anything like that given the pieces that you do already have in place through your ownership of Hulu, etc.? So I'm curious about the advertising infrastructure.
And then, the second, you touched on this a little bit, Christine, but I'm curious if you can share any more relative sizing of the ARPU potential of the ad-supported service. Given that Disney+ is still half the price of Netflix domestically, I'm curious if ad-supported ARPU could actually be higher than where you are right now and if this does present a catalyst for you to raise price on the ad-free service. Thank you.
Bob, why don't you start and then Christine can finish.
OK. We're in really good shape in terms of being able to meet our timing with our Disney+ ad tier. And that's largely because we're already doing it. The combination of our ESPN+, streaming tech stack and our experience in Hulu and the software, we think that our current advertising capabilities really substantially prepare us to already bring this tier into operations.
So there's nothing that we need to go acquire or, frankly, even in any significant way developing anything new. And that's due to the ongoing investments in technology that we've made over time to increasingly automate much of this process. And we've been looking forward to this for a while. So this is something that's well-greased, if you will.
And our teams are hard at work at making that become a reality.
So on the incremental information you had touched pm our ad-supported tier. At this time, we haven't announced a price point for it. So we're not going to do that today. But we will continue to evaluate what makes sense for the service in terms of pricing.
And I will say that you can look to our experience with Hulu and their ad-supported tier. We believe that this will contribute to ARPU. And we look at it as certainly something additive that will work toward achieving our long-term profitability goals.

1.0,"It's not easy to choose an accounting software application. There are a ton of choices out there, and they're all clamoring to get your attention. But not all accounting software applications are created equal.
Some excel in invoicing while coming up short on other key accounting features, while others include stellar reporting options but only offer basic accounting capability. So which one is right for you? Read on and find out.
Zoho Books and FreshBooks are both popular accounting tools, but their utility may vary, depending on the kind of business you own.
Though both applications are designed for small business owners with limited accounting knowledge, and both offer good bookkeeping and accounting features, Zoho Books and FreshBooks present two very different options for small business owners.
We break down the differences and the similarities to make the decision-making process a little bit easier.
Zoho Books is a good entry-level accounting application that currently offers three affordably priced plans and is a good FreshBooks alternative. A good fit for sole proprietors, freelancers, and small businesses, Zoho Books can be a good fit if your business centers around selling products.
If you're self-employed, working as an independent contractor, consultant, or sole proprietor, FreshBooks was designed for you. FreshBooks recently restructured their pricing levels, now offering four plans, making it easier to scale up to a more powerful plan if necessary.
Both Zoho Books and FreshBooks offer a great selection of features, although the features can vary significantly from product to product.
Zoho Books offers excellent sales management features such as customer estimates, custom invoicing, the option to create recurring invoices, and the ability to manage payments.
You can easily convert a sales order or an estimate to an invoice, and if you're looking for a completely customized invoice, Zoho Books will guide you step-by-step through the invoice creation process. After making a sale, you'll be able to keep track of all your customer's details.
The client portal makes it easy for your customers to pay their invoices online, and it expedites the approval process for both quotes and estimates, while also allowing your clients to easily manage their personal information themselves.
For those selling products, Zoho Books can be particularly helpful, as it offers inventory management features, such as the ability to track items using different units of measurement. You can also track a cost and a selling price for any product for easy tracking of cost of goods sold, and stock on hand is tracked in real time.
In addition, Zoho Books lets you add a product image to your inventory file, set reorder levels, and create custom markup and markdown lists for preferred customers.
Zoho Books also includes good vendor management, so go ahead and assign a payment method to each vendor. Expenses can be uploaded directly into Zoho Books by snapping a picture of a receipt, and if you pay a vendor the same amount monthly (think rent), you can create a recurring bill.
Other notable features in Zoho Books include bank connectivity, time tracking, and a mobile app for both iOS and Android devices. However, one of Zoho Books biggest downsides is the lack of a payroll module either within the application or as an integrated app.
FreshBooks offers a long and continually updated list of features. But among all the new features and functions, one that still stands out is invoicing. FreshBooks has made the act of creating an invoice a simple process that takes less than a minute. And these aren't plain, run-of-the mill invoices.
You can create a professional-looking FreshBooks invoice with your own logo and accent colors effortlessly using the invoice generator feature in FreshBooks. Invoice a new client immediately without having to stop and enter their personal details.
You can make the invoice recurring, set a notification option if the customer is late with their payment, and add a late fee if you wish. If you sell globally, you can create your invoice in your customer's native currency.
Payment is easy as well, since you can add a payment link that takes your customer directly to FreshBooks Payments, where they can pay by credit card or ACH transfer. You can also accept electronic payments using Stripe.
It's been a little over a year since FreshBooks added double-entry accounting capability to their application, making it a true bookkeeping and accounting application, a must for anyone who wants to add employees, accrue expenses, or grow their business.
Other useful features in FreshBooks include the Retainers option, great for attorneys, CPAs, or consultants who provide recurring services to clients, allowing you to budget and reserve blocks of time on a recurring basis.
Expenses are easily tracked in FreshBooks, and you can snap a photo of a receipt using its mobile app (available for both iOS and Android smartphones and other devices), later uploading the photo and dropping it into the expense screen.
Another great feature is the time-tracking feature, complete with a timer that can be used on your desktop or mobile device for conveniently tracking time from any location. While payroll is not included in FreshBooks, it does offer integration with Gusto.
It's a tie. While Zoho Books may be the best option for businesses selling products, FreshBooks is the better choice for service businesses.
Support availability is always important, but perhaps more so to new business owners who are learning their way around the bookkeeping process and learning a new software product at the same time.
While Zoho Books and FreshBooks are both easy-to-use applications, it's still nice to know that support is only a phone call away.
Zoho Books offers excellent choices when you need extra help, with both telephone and email support options available.
In addition, Zoho Books offers numerous resources designed to support new users including a migration guide, a quick navigation guide, and an extensive selection of resources designed to make new users feel comfortable using the application.
Other resources include access to a user community, FAQ page, and numerous webinars, which you can register for on the Zoho Books website.
FreshBooks is so easy to use that it's likely you'll never have to call support. But if you do, there's live support personnel on the other end of the phone, ready to answer your questions.
FreshBooks also offers excellent online support options like a searchable knowledge base that will likely answer most of your questions. You can also access support via email during extended business hours.
Zoho Books wins this round. Although both offer live support options, Zoho Books also includes a variety of user guides and step-by-step help throughout the application.
Ideally, when you log into your accounting software, you should be able to view the home page and know instinctively how to access the features you need.
While not the case for all software applications, both Zoho Books and FreshBooks offer intuitive user-navigation screens, so you don't have to spend a lot of time training, but can jump right in and start entering data.
Zoho Books makes it easy to get started, though your first session can take a bit of time. During the Zoho Books setup process, you'll need to enter details about your business, add sales tax information for your area, enable the modules that you want to use, and finally connect to online payment apps.
Once those steps are complete, you can return to the dashboard, which provides video overviews, helps you set up your client portal, and guides you through the rest of the setup process.
Zoho Books has a vertical navigation bar which allows you to choose the modules you want to access. Clicking on a module will display a drop-down menu that includes all the options within that module. Data-entry screens are uncluttered and offer easy access to Help and other resources should you get stuck.
New users can sign into FreshBooks and immediately know how to access a particular feature. Once signed in for the first time, you'll be directed to the dashboard, where you can start the entire setup process.
As you make your way through the setup process, you'll be able to see your progress displayed. Once setup is complete, you're ready to start entering transactions using the sidebar to the left of the dashboard.
FreshBooks entry screens are uncluttered and efficiently arranged, so you don't have to scroll through a lot of information in order to access the areas you need, and this structure remains the same throughout the application.
Each time you enter a transaction for the first time, FreshBooks will display additional help resources on-screen. You can also access help from any screen in the application.
FreshBooks is the winner here. While both applications are easy to use and offer multiple resources specifically designed for new users, FreshBooks takes it one step further with an intuitive interface that new users will be comfortable with immediately.
For sole proprietors and very small businesses, pricing can be an issue. Even if you don't face budgetary constraints, no one wants to overpay for something. Both Zoho Books and FreshBooks are affordably priced and within the range of just about any business, even those with a very tight budget.
The scalability of Zoho Books is one of its most attractive features, with the Standard plan offering more than enough in the way of features for a sole proprietor or small business just starting out, while giving you the flexibility to move up to a more powerful plan when it becomes necessary.
Pricing for Zoho Books is among the lowest in the industry, and all plans include custom invoicing, expense tracking, budgeting, sales, and bank reconciliation. There are currently no payroll options available in Zoho Books.
All FreshBooks fees are reasonable, and all plans include unlimited custom invoicing, unlimited expense entries, the ability to accept online payments, unlimited time tracking, and bank connectivity. If you have employees to pay, FreshBooks also offers integration with Gusto Payroll.
FreshBooks wins again. The pricing structures in Zoho Books and FreshBooks are similar, but the special pricing FreshBooks is offering makes this a deal too good to pass up.
Integration may not matter to you right now, but that might not always be the case. If you think you might need your software solution to integrate with other applications, here's how Zoho Books and FreshBooks stack up.
Zoho Books offers excellent integration options, including payment gateways such as Stripe, PayPal, Worldpay, WePay, and Square.
Other integrations include Slack, Microsoft Office 365, Fundbox, and Avalara as well as complete integration with Zoho Suite applications such as Zoho CRM, Zoho Inventory, and Zoho Sign. In addition, the application offers access to more than 500 additional apps through Zapier.
FreshBooks offers integration with more than 100 apps as well as an additional 1,500 apps through Zapier. Popular integrations include Gusto, Stripe, Bench, Shopify, Zoom, Acuity, Avalara, Taxfyle, eBay, Slack, Salesforce, and Eventbrite.
It's a tie. If you're looking for integration with more apps, FreshBooks is tops, but if you're looking for integration with numerous online payment applications, Zoho comes out on top. Either way, the integration options are considerable.
Reporting requirements can vary widely from company to company. You may be perfectly content with having access to a few good reports, while the business next door desires a more comprehensive selection of reports. If reporting choices are important to your business, see how Zoho Books and FreshBooks compare.
Zoho Books includes more than 50 reports that cover numerous categories, including accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory, invoicing, purchases and expenses, and taxes. A financial dashboard is also available if you're looking for a quick summary of your business activity.
Any Zoho Books report can be customized, and you have the option to schedule reports to run when you want them to. If Zoho Books customization isn't enough, you can export any report to Microsoft Excel or as a CSV file.
FreshBooks reporting options are fairly basic, though they should be sufficient if you're self-employed. Currently FreshBooks includes 12 reports, including standard financial statements.
Available reports include a Retainer Summary report, an Accounts Aging Report, a Revenue by Client report, and a Time Entry Details report.
A dashboard report that highlights outstanding revenue, total profit, revenue streams, spending, and unbilled time is also available, and all reports can be exported to Excel for customization if desired.
Offering more than 50 standard reports, Zoho Books wins this one. Both products offer a financial dashboard for a quick view of your business finances.
Zoho Books and FreshBooks are both strong contenders in this head-to-head comparison, and although our winner is FreshBooks, Zoho Books isn’t very far behind. In many cases, Zoho Books may be the better option for your business, particularly if you’re interested in using other Zoho applications.
However, if you’re a new business owner, or a new accounting software user, FreshBooks makes it easy for you to get started, with a simple user interface, surprisingly powerful bookkeeping and general ledger capability, and a good selection of features that will have you entering financial transactions for your business a lot faster than you might believe.","FreshBooks and Zoho Books, two of NerdWallet’s picks for best accounting software, aren’t as scalable as products like QuickBooks Online and Xero, but can be affordable choices for specific types of small businesses.
Whereas FreshBooks offers more third-party integrations for freelancers and independent contractors, Zoho Books pulls ahead for its higher user limits and more complex feature set. The choice depends on which third-party apps your business uses (and whether they integrate), along with what type of reporting capabilities you need, among other factors.
Has a strong invoicing feature; app lets users send invoices on the go, scan receipts and track mileage; basic inventory tracking for billable items; least expensive plan lacks double-entry accounting reports.
Includes robust reporting tools, but offers fewer reports than competitors; has customizable invoicing features, advanced inventory control in higher tier plans and a capable mobile app.
Auto-categorizes transactions for you, but you can’t set up your own bank rules; no global search function; least expensive plan lacks bank reconciliation tools.
Includes tools that help automate the reconciliation process; auto-categorizes transactions for you and lets you set up your own bank rules; no global search function.
Can support freelancers, contractors and small businesses with a handful of employees; highest-tier plan includes two users (additional users can be added for a fee).
Typically serves businesses with fewer than 100 employees; highest-tier plan includes 15 users (additional users can be added for a fee).
Least expensive plan doesn’t allow accountant access; lacks complete audit trail.
Has audit trails and offers easy accountant access; less popular than other competitors.
Integrates with more than 100 third-party apps; limited choices for direct payroll and point-of-sale integrations.
Integrates with fewer than 50 third-party apps; limited choices for direct payroll and point-of-sale integrations; no live bookkeeping integrations.
Includes phone support in all plans 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET from Monday to Friday; offers email support, but not live chat support with a human.
24/5 phone and live chat support included in all paid plans.
Plans start at $17 per month.
Offers a free plan, plus a range of paid plans.
Project tracking tools in higher-tier plans; lacks industry-specific reports and transaction tracking tags; users with multiple businesses must pay for separate subscriptions.
Includes project tracking tools in paid plans, along with transaction tracking tags; lacks industry-specific reports; users with multiple businesses must pay for separate subscriptions.
Accounting software typically enables accountant access in every plan — Zoho Books, for instance, even includes it in its free plan for businesses with less than $50,000 in annual revenue. However, FreshBooks’ least expensive Lite plan lacks basic capabilities like accountant access. Zoho Books also stands out from FreshBooks by keeping audit trails, which help accountants check books for errors or unauthorized transactions.
Before committing to Zoho Books, though, make sure that your accountant is familiar with it. The software isn’t as popular as FreshBooks.
If you like to dig into your reports or own a business with multiple departments, Zoho Books will likely be the better option. FreshBooks’ Lite plan doesn’t offer double-entry accounting reports (like a general ledger and balance sheet). Zoho Books includes these in every plan, plus more. All of its paid plans let you add reporting tags to transactions, so that you can drill into reports and separate results by location, department, etc.
Zoho Books’ inventory management features are also more robust. You can generate barcodes for items and set reorder levels so that you can see what’s running low at a glance. Separately, the software lets you create your own custom bank rules for categorizing incoming transactions. This can save you a lot of time if your business has a high volume of transactions flowing in from bank feeds each month. FreshBooks will suggest transaction matches for you, but you can’t set up your own rules for categorizing transactions that meet your set of criteria.
All FreshBooks plans, except the Select plan, only permit one user, so if you need to share your account with a co-owner or accountant, you’ll end up paying extra. Zoho Books’ user limits, on the other hand, scale up with plan tiers. It’s also less expensive to add additional users to Zoho Books vs. FreshBooks if you need to.
FreshBooks’ billable client limits in its Lite and Plus plans may be a drawback, too. You’re allowed up to five billable clients in the Lite plan and up to 50 in the Plus plan. Zoho Books doesn’t limit billable clients in any of its plans, including the free one. Instead, its free plan lets you send up to 1,000 invoices, which is more than many small businesses will send in one year.
Zoho Books is part of the larger Zoho suite of apps, so if you already use Zoho for other aspects of your business (such as customer relationship management, information technology or human resources), you can sync all your business management systems on one platform. If you don’t use other Zoho apps, however, the product’s sparse integrations with third-party tools might be a deal breaker.
For example, Zoho only integrates with Zoho Payroll or SurePayroll for payroll. If you use a different service, you won’t be able to integrate it with Zoho, leaving you with a lot of manual data entry. Compared with Zoho Books, FreshBooks offers greater options for third-party integrations.
Cost: $30 per month and up.
If you’re looking for more established software from a widely recognized and trusted brand, then check out QuickBooks Online. It’s a cloud-based option from Intuit, and while its plans are a bit more expensive, it has fewer restrictions than Zoho or FreshBooks.
With any QuickBooks Online plan, you get income and expense tracking, receipt capture, invoice tracking, reports and accountant access. Its least expensive plan comes with many of the features you’d expect to get from a mid-level plan from another provider. You also have the option to sign up for add-ons like time tracking or payroll.
Wave is one of the few free accounting software options for businesses. It allows unlimited bank and credit card connections, unlimited income and expense tracking and unlimited guest collaborators. The software also helps you implement invoice reminders when necessary.
Wave’s feature set isn’t the most robust, and customer service for its free products is limited to a self-service help center. However, it is still a comprehensive solution, and the price can make it an excellent choice for newer businesses or those on a strict budget.",Fool,Nerdwallet,,,
0.88,"Water is the most important commodity that we largely take for granted.
Water is essential not only for life but for a range of industries and almost all economic activities. From agriculture to beverages to industrial applications to consumer staples, there is a clear and growing demand for fresh, clean water, and there's only a limited supply. Add in the impact of climate change, which is shifting water flows and leading to potential water shortages all over the globe, and there is a pressing need for governments and the private sector to invest in water infrastructure.
A market with nearly unlimited demand and only limited supplies can make for an intriguing investment. There are a large number of water stocks to pick from, including utilities, filtration companies, and the makers of pumps and pipes needed to transport water.
But utilities tend to be limited in their geographic reach, and water tech and equipment companies are often specialists. You'd have to buy a lot of stocks to get exposure to the entire sector. With that in mind, it might make more sense to invest in water through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that gives you a small interest in a large number of companies focused on making sure clean water gets to where it is needed.
Investment management company Invesco (IVZ  -1.34%) dominates the water ETF market, and the Water Resources fund is its largest offering. Based on the NASDAQ U.S. Water Index, the fund seeks to track the performance of companies in the business of purifying, delivering, and conserving water for homes, businesses, and industries. It is not limited to companies that are doing business in the U.S., but it is heavily focused on stocks that trade on U.S. markets.
The five stocks represent about 39% of total assets. Invesco Water Resources has a 0.60% expense ratio.
The water ETF sponsored by First Trust Advisors is based on the ISE Clean Edge Water Index, which is composed of companies that derive a substantial portion of their revenues from the potable and wastewater industry. That can include utilities and other companies, but the index is weighed toward the companies that make the tech that helps to make water safe to drink.
The five stocks represent about 20% of total assets. The ETF has a 0.54% expense ratio.
As the name implies, the Invesco S&P Global Water Index gives you more international exposure and is based on the S&P Global (SPGI  -0.53%) Water Index. The fund aims to invest at least 90% of its total assets in securities tracking that index. The S&P Dow Jones Indices index the fund is based on is designed to measure the performance of the 50 largest global companies in water-related businesses.
The five stocks represent about 32.7% of total assets. The ETF has an expense ratio of 0.57%.
This, too, is an index fund, tracking the Nasdaq OMX Global Water Index. About 55% of fund assets are based in the U.S., followed by the U.K., Switzerland, and Japan. The fund also has exposure to emerging markets, including China and Brazil.
The five stocks represent about 37% of total assets. The ETF has an expense ratio of 0.75%.
Ecofin is a relatively new entry in the water ETFs and has a focus on sustainability. The fund will only invest in companies that derive at least 50% of revenue from the water industry or are ranked as a top company in a water category. Companies must also rank high on an ESG screen.
Combined, the five stocks represent about 36% of the portfolio. The ETF has a 0.40% expense ratio.
Plant-based eating has grown in popularity. These companies are in the middle of it.
Water isn't the most glamorous investment, but it is hard to think of a commodity more critical to society. Nations have gone to war over access to water. Those days are hopefully behind us, but given how widely water is used and the limited amounts of it available in many parts of the world, water should be an area of significant investment and growth in the years to come.
Buying into the water industry can provide a nice counterweight to more speculative tech investments or boom-and-bust cyclical companies. Buying ETFs instead of individual companies provides an easy way to gain geographic and subsector diversification without having to devote too much of your portfolio to the industry.","Water is one of the planet’s most coveted and widely used resources. Like other commodities, such as oil and gold, water assets can add significant diversification to any portfolio.
One way to gain exposure to the water industry is through a water exchange-traded fund (ETF). These ETFs invest in companies involved in the treatment and purification of water, as well as its distribution. Some notable names include Germany-based BASF SE (BAS.DE), 3M Co. (MMM), and ITT Inc. (ITT).
As an essential commodity, water ETFs are often used as a defensive position in a portfolio. However, to the extent that water scarcity becomes a growing threat, these ETFs could be a significant offensive play as well.
We examine the best three water ETFs below. All numbers below are as of Sept. 6, 2022.2 In order to focus on the funds' investment strategy, the top holdings listed for each ETF exclude cash holdings and holdings purchased with securities lending proceeds except under unusual cases, such as when the cash portion is exceptionally large.

0.875,"Many of us were not fortunate enough to buy shares of today's high-growth tech stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA 0.92%) at the initial public offering (IPO) price. But for a few reasons, it's a helpful exercise to look at how much money you would have made if you did get in at the beginning.
To start, it reinforces the power of compound returns on a relatively small investment. Along with that, it highlights the importance of patience. There may be some investors who did buy a $10,000 stake in NVIDIA around the IPO price, but did those investors keep holding after that $10,000 turned into $50,000? If not, they left a lot of money on the table.
It can be very tempting to sell a winner after it's risen in value, but investors who think of themselves as business owners will keep holding, knowing that it would be nearly impossible to find another company to invest in that is as good as the one they currently hold.
With that said, let's look at how much you would have made if you had bought shares of NVIDIA at the IPO price.
A $10,000 investment would have purchased 833 shares at the IPO price. Those shares would have turned into 9,996 shares after all the stock splits. At the current stock quote of around $214, the value of your investment would be $2,139,144.
To be honest, I probably would have been one of those investors who started selling some shares once my initial investment turned into $30,000 or $50,000. But if you have the mindset to let your winners run, all it takes is one moderate NVIDIA investment to make you a millionaire.
NVIDIA's business involves selling very pricey graphics cards that generate high margins. This allows it to generate more free cash flow than management knows what to do with, so the company takes some of that spare cash and pays a small dividend to shareholders. The current quarterly payout is $0.16 per share.
If you owned 9,996 shares, you would be earning $1,599 per quarter in dividend income, which comes to $6,397 over a year.
NVIDIA initiated its first quarterly dividend in 2012 at $0.075 per share. The dividend payout has more than doubled in the last seven years, and it should continue to increase over time as revenue and free cash flow grow.
Another reason that early investors of NVIDIA would have wanted to hang on to their shares is that the business has found more ways to grow over the last decade. The cumulative return of the stock since the IPO is 21,300%. Over the last 10 years, the stock price has increased by 1,290%. That means a $1,000 investment in December 2009 would have already turned into $13,900.
NVIDIA has long been known for its innovation in graphics cards for those who play video games on a PC. It's the market-share leader in the discrete graphics card market, leading its rival Advanced Micro Devices. But management has found additional applications for its core graphics technology, opening up a lot more possibilities for NVIDIA to expand.
More demand is coming from organizations that need powerful graphics chips to process mountains of data with artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (an advanced form of AI). NVIDIA has also formed partnerships with several leading automakers to develop self-driving cars using the NVIDIA DRIVE platform.
Sales of gaming graphics cards still make up most of NVIDIA's annual revenue, but the data center, professional visualization, and automotive segments are just as important to the company's future growth.
The stock is up 62% year to date, but it is still below the all-time high in 2018. NVIDIA suffered a setback last year from a slowdown in its gaming and data center business. With those markets starting to return to growth, it's not too late to consider adding shares of NVIDIA to your portfolio.
John Ballard owns shares of NVIDIA. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends NVIDIA. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.","Founded in 1993, American technology company Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) has grown to become one of the industry leaders in manufacturing graphic processing units for computer and gaming devices as well as Artificial Intelligence and enterprise computing. The company benefited from the artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency markets in 2017 with its shares rising 92%, but the stock has fallen 30 percent in 2018 as of November 22.
The company went public in January 1999, with its shares priced at $19.69 each. An investment of $1,969 would have bought you 100 shares, but after four stock splits you would now be the owner of 1,200 NVDA shares, and your initial capital with reinvested dividends would now have grown to $291,652 as of November 1, 2018. Check NVDA's most recent share price here.
While the company’s growth has fueled the astronomical gains for its stock price, stock splits and dividends also gave a big bump to initial investors.
A little over a year since its listing, the company executed its first stock split, offering two shares for one held by investors. That means an initial 100 shares would now become 200 shares. At the close price of $71.25, the $1,969 investment would now be worth $14,250, a 623% growth.
Just a year later, Nvidia decided to split its stock again, offering a 2:1 split. The number of shares held would now increase to 400, and at the price of $33.29, the investment would now be worth $13,596, a little lower than the previous year but still an impressive 590% return on the initial $1,969 investment.
In 2006, the company announced another 2:1 stock split. The number of shares now increase to 800 and at a price of $30.53 apiece, the investment is now worth $24,424 and spectacular 1,140% gain over the initial $1,969 investment.
The last of the stock splits so far, Nvidia offered a 3:2 split which means the 100 shares bought at the time of the IPO are now 1,200 shares. At a $34.58 price, the initial investment of $1,969 would now be worth $41,496, a 2,007% jump.
Nvidia paid out its first dividend in 2006, and the next payout was made six years later in 2012. Since November 2012, the company has declared a dividend every quarter, adding to the value of the investment.
If you had invested in 100 shares, an initial investment of $1,969, that money, including reinvested dividends, would have grown to $291,652, as of November 1, 2018, a whopping 14,712% return on investment.

0.875,"Guns are a controversial topic in U.S. politics, with arguments pitting gun-control advocates against defenders of Second Amendment rights. Companies that sell weapons often come under attack after mass shootings, and some investors get nervous about the business's long-term prospects. Yet gun stocks don't always react to changing sentiment in the way you would expect. For example, share prices often go up when the news puts more urgency on the issue of gun control; sales rise when the fear of tighter regulation spurs gun fans to stock up. By contrast, periods when there is no prospect that Washington will implement new gun regulations can be poor ones for weapons manufacturers, because that fear-based demand dries up. Such nuances make it crucial to understand the weapons industry before buying stock in a manufacturer.
We'll look at each of these factors below.
The first question investors need to ask is whether they want a pure play on guns or broader exposure. Some gunmakers have embraced related products in order to diversify their businesses. For instance, Smith & Wesson switched its name to  American Outdoor Brands a year ago in order to emphasize the non-gun products in its lineup, which include electronic optics, tree saws, flashlights, knives, and other accessories. Vista Outdoor goes even further, with offerings like Bushnell golf products, Bell and Giro cycling accessories, and Camelbak hydration systems to go with its Savage Arms gun and Federal Premium ammunition brands. Olin is a diversified conglomerate, making chemicals in addition to maintaining its Winchester brand.
Other companies maintain a tighter focus. Sturm, Ruger is well-known for its Ruger gun line, and it markets pistols, revolvers, and rifles along with an assortment of gun-related accessories. You'll find knives and pepper spray at the Ruger website, but it's clearly a weapons-centric business.
Image source: American Outdoor Brands.
Another thing to consider as an investor is which parts of the weapon industry you think is likely to thrive. Military weaponry goes well beyond guns, and the companies that produce sophisticated equipment like tactical missile systems, tanks, and attack aircraft are typically defense contractors with huge operations.
By contrast, gun manufacturers that serve the consumer market tend to be much smaller. Those more modest roots give them greater opportunities to grow, but the risks involved are consequently higher.
Investors who favor exchange-traded funds will be disappointed to learn that there are no gun-specific ETFs, and even some of the funds that focus on so-called ""sin stocks"" tend to shy away from gun manufacturers.
You can find plenty of ETFs that concentrate on defense stocks, so if military weaponry is your primary interest, then that's an option. To get exposure to companies like Sturm, Ruger and American Outdoor Brands, however, you'll have to buy individual company shares.
Gun manufacturers generally had a tough 2017, with a friendly political environment removing any sense of urgency among buyers. As companies adapt to changing conditions, however, many bulls are hopeful that gun stocks can recover and rise in 2018 and beyond.
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sturm wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.
Dan Caplinger has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.","Following the tragic shooting at at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last month, investors became increasingly vocal about funds and other investment vehicles owning shares of publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers. Even some passively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have come under scrutiny for small stakes in gun makers.
BlackRock said that 95% of its U.S.-listed ETFs do not hold those three gun stocks. The list of iShares ETFs that do hold shares of civilian gun manufacturers does, however, include some well-known ETFs. That list includes fixed income and equity products. As of Feb. 26, iShares ETFs holding gun stocks included the iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF (CRBN), iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) and iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR).
The issuer's ETFs that do not own civilian gun manufacturers also include well-known fare such as the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (DSI) and iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV).

Sometimes breakups happen without much warning. In the case of Chase and Korean Air, they gave customers just weeks of notice before ending their partnership on Aug. 25, 2018.
A significant benefit of Chase's Ultimate Rewards program has always been its numerous transfer partners, so seeing it lose one is a step in the wrong direction. Let's explore what the immediate ramifications are for this and how much of an impact it has.
Korean Air is the airline of choice for flights to South Korea, as it's the nation's largest carrier. It also offers flights to many of the mid to large-size destinations in Asia, with particularly impressive coverage in China, where it's one of the largest foreign airlines in operation.
If you frequently travel from the United States to Asia, were planning a vacation there, or live in South Korea, then the Chase-Korean Air breakup is a big loss. If you don't fall into any of those categories, it's less of an issue, especially considering there are still ways to book Korean Air flights using Ultimate Rewards points.

Transfer Ultimate Rewards points to Flying Blue -- Flying Blue is the rewards program for Air France and KLM, which are both in the SkyTeam airline alliance with Korean Air. With Flying Blue miles, you can book a Korean Air award flight on either Air France's or KLM's site. You'll need to find award space on the flight you want, which can make this option hit or miss.
These cards are only worth considering if Korean Air is your airline of choice. If not, there are travel rewards cards with more versatile rewards and benefits.
The loss of Korean Air doesn't have much of an effect on the value of Chase's Ultimate Rewards points, as there are many other partner airlines remaining. It'd be more of a problem if Chase lost Southwest or United, as those are major domestic carriers. Chase also added JetBlue as a transfer partner a day after dropping Korean Air, so you could call it a wash.
Considering how competitive the credit card market is, it's unlikely that Chase will do anything that makes its cards significantly worse. Instead, it will probably continue doing what it has been -- creating new rules that prevent consumers from churning through its cards to rack up more points and making small changes here and there in areas most people won't notice.
When it comes to credit card rewards programs, changes can happen at any time. Korean Air was a mainstay in the Ultimate Rewards program, until one day, it wasn't. Fortunately, those Ultimate Rewards points can still help you book a flight on Korean Air.","Chase Ultimate Rewards® members will have one less transfer partner by the end of August. The bank and Korean Air announced they made the mutual decision to end their relationship: Ultimate Rewards® points will no longer be transferable to Korean Air SKYPASS effective Aug. 25, 2018.
The move will end one SkyTeam transfer option with Ultimate Rewards® and create a roadblock for SKYPASS miles flyers who regularly booked Korean Air award flights. Despite the change, frequent flyers still have multiple ways to gain big from Ultimate Rewards® and other programs.
When Ultimate Rewards® ends its partnership with SKYPASS, several award sweet spots will disappear for Chase cardholders. This includes using SKYPASS miles to book flights on Delta Air Lines and other SkyTeam partners, or booking awards on Emirates as an airline partner.
As an alternative for Delta flights, Ultimate Rewards® can still be transferred to Virgin Atlantic Flying Club and used with Delta. Round-trip flights between the West Coast and Hawaii aboard Delta economy are available for 40,000 Flying Club points.
To use Ultimate Rewards® with SkyTeam partners, transfer points to Flying Blue, the combined loyalty program of Air France and KLM. Points transfer at a 1-to-1 ratio and usually deposit into a Flying Blue account instantly. Before moving points, be sure to look up award availability on the Flying Blue website. To confirm that an award ticket books correctly, it’s always a good idea to book awards over the phone instead of online.
Unfortunately, after the ending date there will be no easy way to directly book award flights for Korean Air, or on its luxury partners, including Emirates. Instead, flyers may be able to seek new awards through the new Ultimate Rewards® Travel center. Those who hold the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card can exchange points through the travel portal for 1.25 cents per point, while Chase Sapphire Reserve® can book travel through the portal at a value of 1.5 cents for each point.
If you fly between the United States and South Korea often, or find value in the SKYPASS program, there is one remaining option available: Korean Air offers SKYPASS-earning credit cards through U.S. Bank.
There are four levels of Korean Air SKYPASS credit cards, including the SKYPASS Visa® Secured Card. Before applying for one of the credit cards, be sure to read all the benefits to see which one makes the most sense for your budget.
After Aug. 25, none of the major bank rewards programs will offer transfers to Korean Air SKYPASS. Holding a Korean Air SKYPASS credit card will be the only way to consistently earn miles.

0.8510638298,"Here’s a look at the most common situations in which mold may—or may not—be covered by homeowners insurance.
Homeowners insurance policies spell out a list of “covered perils,” meaning instances of damage to the home for which you’re eligible to file a claim. The main cause of mold formation is water seeping into the structure of your home, so you need to know which water-related covered perils are included in your policy.
In these instances mold would be “resulting damage” from a covered peril. It’s important to distinguish between resulting damage and initial damage. For example, if your water heater breaks and a leak causes mold to form in the walls, then your policy might pay for the walls to be repaired and the mold to be removed but not for the replacement of the hot water heater.
It’s important to note that the amount your policy may pay for mold repair and removal might not cover all of the resulting damage. “This extent of mold coverage is typically limited—for example, a company may cap mold removal and remediation at $10,000 for a single occurrence,” says Pat Howard, homeowners insurance expert at Policygenius. Higher coverage limits may be available, but if you’re unsure about what’s covered, Howard suggests talking to your agent to find out what options you have.
When taking out homeowners insurance, pay close attention to coverage limits.
In some cases mold can grow as a result of water damage from outside forces. Whether your homeowners insurance covers mold in that instance depends on what caused the damage to begin with.
That may be worth the investment, however, if you’re concerned about mold resulting from a flood. According to FEMA, just one inch of water in your home can cause $25,000 in damage.2﻿ Flood insurance with mold coverage could help mitigate some of the cost.
Mold that results from other acts of nature, such as a hurricane or an ice storm, may be covered under your homeowners insurance policy. For instance, if a hurricane tears your roof off and water gets inside the home, causing mold to grow, you might be able to file a claim for that along with other damages to the home.
Say that you notice the seal around the base of your toilet is leaking water. Instead of replacing the seal or the toilet, you let the leak continue, which causes damage to the subflooring. From there, mold sets in and spreads to the baseboards and walls. In that instance your homeowners insurance policy claim may be denied because you were in a position to prevent the mold from happening.
There are several things you can do to prevent mold and/or improve the odds of having your claim approved if you incur mold damage.
If your homeowners insurance company denies your mold claim, you may want to get a licensed contractor to offer a second opinion on what caused the damage. You could also attempt to appeal the denial with your insurance company if it has a specified appeals process. If not, your state insurance commissioner may be able to offer help on what you can do to get the claim approved or to file a complaint about denial.
FEMA. ""Historical Flood Risk and Costs.""","A homeowners policy usually pays for mold damage only if it’s caused by a covered issue such as a burst pipe.
Homeowners insurance won’t pay to clean up mold due to flood damage.
There are certain types of coverage you can add to your homeowners policy to pay for some mold damage.
Whether your homeowners insurance covers mold damage largely depends on the cause of the mold. If you find mold in your home, here are the options that may be available to you.
Homeowners insurance generally covers mold only when it's caused by a ""covered peril"" — an event your homeowners insurance policy will pay for, such as accidental water damage.
For example, if your washing machine suddenly springs a leak and black mold develops on the floor, a homeowners policy will likely pay to remove the mold. If the floor is damaged beyond repair, your policy may also pay to replace it.
Water damage caused by extinguishing a fire.
A burst or frozen pipe.
Though your policy may cover mold damage from a broken appliance, it probably won’t pay to replace the device; most insurers cover only the resulting water and mold damage, not the cause of the damage.
Some insurance companies limit the amount they will pay for mold removal. So even if your insurer accepts your claim, you may still need to shoulder some of the costs.
Confused about your coverage? Read your policy carefully or call your insurance agent to go over the details.
Poorly sealed doors or windows.
A leaky faucet that you haven’t fixed.
Lack of ventilation in a moist room, like a bathroom.
Below are a few other common causes of mold damage that a standard home insurance policy usually won’t cover.
Sump pump failure and water backup damage. Damage caused by water backup or a sump pump failure can be costly, and standard home insurance policies usually won’t cover it. However, many insurers offer sump pump failure and water backup coverage as an optional add-on.
Flood damage. Standard homeowners policies generally exclude flooding. If you’re at risk, consider buying separate flood insurance.
However, even if you have flood insurance, your policy may not cover mold damage. The country’s biggest flood insurance provider, the National Flood Insurance Program, covers mold damage only if you can't access your home after a flood.
Mold damage coverage varies by the flood insurance policy. If you’re not sure what your policy includes, talk to your insurer.
» MORE: Does homeowners insurance cover roof leaks?
Though a standard home insurance policy doesn't usually cover the above situations, that doesn't mean you're out of luck. Below are other options your insurer may offer.
Sump pump failure and water backup coverage can pay for water and mold damage from a backed-up drain, broken sump pump or clogged sewer line. However, sump pump failure and water backup coverage will likely not pay for gradual issues such as water leaking in through your home's foundation. It also won't cover issues like flooding caused by a rising river or lake near your home.
Hidden water damage coverage pays for damage from leaks you can’t see, like a burst pipe behind a wall. It could also cover mold cleanup. However, not all companies sell this insurance.
Mold can start to form in as little as one day, so acting fast is important.
Document the damage. Take photos and videos of mold and water damage you find. Make a list of everything that was damaged. Be as thorough and truthful as possible. False reporting, even if accidental, can work against your claim.
Clean up excess water, and dehumidify the area. Wipe up pools of water and use a dehumidifier or air conditioner to dry out the site. Place wet items outside in a secure area to dry. If you're having trouble cleaning up the water, consider hiring a professional. Your insurance agent may be able to help you find trusted water removal contractors in your area.
Make temporary repairs to prevent further damage. You don't want to make major fixes before filing your claim, but once you've documented the damage, make temporary repairs to protect your home from further damage. For example, if your basement is flooded, you can remove wet carpeting. Keep receipts for all purchases related to cleanup and repairs.
File as soon as you can. Depending on your insurer, you may be able to file your claim online, through an app or by phone. The sooner you file, the sooner you can clean up the mess (and the less time mold will have to form).
Inspect your pipes, faucets and hoses regularly, and fix leaks right away.
Make sure to direct rainwater away from your home.
Keep humidity low in your house by using air conditioners and dehumidifiers.
Improve bathroom and kitchen ventilation by installing exhaust fans.
Avoid putting carpet in areas at risk for collecting moisture, such as a basement or bathrooms.
Regularly inspect your roof for leaks and keep your gutters free of debris.
Consider replacing the hoses to your dishwasher, washing machine, refrigerator and other large appliances every five years.

0.8235294118,"Protective is our top choice for best term life insurance company. This is because it tied for having the lowest term rates of the companies we reviewed and is one of a handful of companies that provides 40-year term life insurance. It also offers a wide array of other policy types, meaning there’s a good chance you can find a policy suitable for you. But the company scored poorly in a consumer satisfaction survey and doesn’t include as many no-cost living benefit riders as some other companies we reviewed.
Founded in 1907, Protective provides policies in all 50 states and has three operating locations. Its headquarters is in Birmingham, Alabama, and its two other core sites are in Greater Cincinnati and St. Louis. As one of five subsidiaries of the Protective Life Corporation, it provides a variety of methods to obtain coverage, including through Costco and independent agents.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) tracks the number of consumer complaints individual insurers receive, and uses that number to create a complaint index.2 The NAIC complaint index allows you to compare customer complaints across a range of companies, no matter their size. In this way, you can get an idea of how satisfied (or dissatisfied) customers are with the company.
The benchmark is 1.0—which represents the number of complaints a company is expected to receive. A company with a score above 1.0 indicates it received more complaints than expected. Conversely, a score below 1.0 means the company had fewer complaints than expected.
Protective’s complaint index, averaged over three years, was 0.79, meaning the company received fewer complaints than expected.
Financial strength is a critical component to consider when choosing a life insurance company because a life insurance policy is a long-term financial contract—you want to be confident the company will be there and able to pay your beneficiaries when needed and as promised. A life insurance company’s AM Best rating is a good measure of this.
However, Protective does not perform as well when it comes to customer service. In fact, it scored well below average in the 2021 J.D. Power Individual Life Insurance Study. It came in 16th out of 21 carriers, scoring 752 out of a possible 1,000 points (the industry average was 776).
Protective offers a variety of policies and optional features so you can customize your coverage to best suit your needs. You can get a quote and apply for term life insurance online, but you’ll need to contact an agent for all other policy types. Most policies include a terminal illness accelerated benefit rider at no extra charge. The terminal illness rider allows you to accelerate up to 60% of the death benefit (or $1 million, whichever is less) if you have less than six months to live.
Term life insurance offers death benefit protection that lasts anywhere from one to 40 years or more. Unlike most permanent policies, it doesn't build a cash value, and is the most affordable type of life insurance coverage.
According to Protective, its premiums are usually among the top three on the market for similar product types, across all issue ages and face amounts—and our research supports this for term policies. Of the companies we collected term quotes for, Protective tied with Banner for cheapest term life insurance coverage.
Coverage lengths range from 10 to 40 years, with the option to convert to a permanent policy with no medical exam. Protective is one of only three companies we reviewed that offers 40-year term life insurance coverage.
Whole life policies provide life-long guaranteed protection, and build a cash value. Cash value is an essential component to permanent life insurance as it reduces the high cost of life insurance as you age. Over time it can become a source of funds that you can borrow from. In whole life policies, the cash value grows at a fixed rate and is guaranteed as long as you make payments when they are due.
If you decide a whole life policy is best for you because it grows cash value, it is wise to replace any cash you borrow or withdraw from your policy. Otherwise, you could reduce the death benefit for your beneficiaries, or, in some cases, the policy could lapse.
Protective offers its whole life policy to applicants from 0 to 90 years old for coverage of as little as $1,000 and as much as $5,000,000. The policy comes standard with a terminal illness accelerated death benefit at no extra cost.
Universal life (UL) insurance is a permanent policy that grows cash value; but unlike whole life, universal life allows you to adjust your premiums and death benefit.
Unlike other universal life policies, Custom Choice is not designed to provide permanent coverage, but is structured similarly to a term policy. You have the option to exchange it for a permanent policy during the second through 20th policy years, and you’ll pay a relatively low, level premium for a term of up to 30 years. If you want to exchange the policy for permanent coverage (with a higher premium), you won’t have to take a medical exam. It’s available to applicants 18-75 years old.
Variable life insurance can provide coverage for life. It gives you the ability to invest the policy’s tax-deferred cash value in the stock market. Investment options are available via “subaccounts;” choose which to invest in based on your risk tolerance and goals. You can use cash value to pay premiums, but if the investments lose value, your premium could go up.
Protective offers one VUL policy with a range of available features and investment options for applicants up to age 80.
While variable universal life insurance offers higher potential returns, higher returns often come with higher risks. For example, if your investments perform poorly, your premium could increase drastically or the policy could lapse.
If you’re looking for a permanent policy with more potential growth than whole life, but with less risk/reward potential than a variable UL policy, this might be the right choice for you. Indexed universal life (IUL) insurance has growth potential and flexibility with premiums and cash value options like other UL policies. However, the cash value is credited an interest rate based on the performance of a stock market index.
With Protective’s IUL policy, the stock market index used is the S&P 500. You also can choose to invest some (or all) of the cash value in a fixed account that earns interest at a flat rate.
The rate credited to your cash value will never be negative but is subject to limits. For example, if your policy caps gains at 6%, and the index gained 8%, you would be credited no more than 6%.
Guaranteed Insurability Rider (GI): A guaranteed insurability rider is ideal for a young person purchasing a permanent policy who thinks they may want more coverage in the future (say, because they intend to get married or have more children).
Children’s Term Rider: Available on Protective’s IUL, VUL, UL, and term policies, this optional rider provides death benefit protection for all children aged 15 days through 18 years. Coverage continues until age 25 (if the base policy is in force) and can be converted to permanent coverage without having to prove insurability - —meaning your child doesn’t have to take a medical or apply for coverage. A child term rider is an excellent way for parents to establish coverage for their children without purchasing a separate policy.
Waiver of Premium: This optional rider let’s you skip premium payments if you become disabled. Protective’s waiver of premium rider has a six-month elimination period—meaning you must live with the disability for six months before you’re eligible to have premiums waived (an elimination period is a common feature). The rider is available to applicants up to age 55, it expires once you turn 65, and is available on Protective’s term, UL, IUL, and VUL policies.
Accidental Death Benefit: An accidental death benefit rider pays an additional death benefit if you die as the result of an accident. Protective’s version is available on its term, UL, IUL, and VUL policies. It’s available up to age 60 and expires at age 65.
Accelerated Death Benefit: Life insurance with living benefits or accelerated benefit riders allows you to receive a portion of the death benefit early if you experience certain health-related events. Protective offers two—one for terminal illness and one for chronic illness. Only its terminal illness rider is available at no extra cost.
Protective representatives are available by phone at 800-866-9933 between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. Central Time (CT) Monday through Thursday, and between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. CT Friday. Account management features are available to policyholders online, such as submitting payments and submitting a claim.
When it comes to price, Protective can’t be beat. At least not in our analysis of quotes for 30-year $250,000 term life insurance policies for healthy individuals aged 25, 40, and 55 years old. In each age group, Protective had the cheapest term life insurance or tied for having the cheapest. And according to the company, premiums typically rank in the top three for similar products across issue ages and face amounts.
If price is a priority, start with Protective.
If you’re in the market for affordable, no-frills, long-term term coverage, you should consider Protective. It’s top-ranked for cheap term coverage, and offers 40-year-term life insurance—which is uncommon in the industry. The company has a wide range of universal life policies available as well, including a term-like UL policy that may be suitable if you want the flexibility of a cash value component, or the potential to build one.
However, if a comprehensive suite of living benefits is important to you, such as no-cost accelerated death benefit riders for chronic, critical, and terminal illnesses, consider other companies' offerings. And if you’re looking for a policy that pays dividends or if you have health issues and need a final expense policy, you should look elsewhere.

0.8072289157,"The economy would get nowhere without transportation stocks.
The business of getting people and goods from point A to point B is massive. Companies in the transportation industry run trains, trucks, planes, and ships, operate warehouses, and help manufacturers move goods. Globally, transportation is a $6 trillion industry. There are so many different companies doing so many different things that an investor could fill out an entire portfolio gaining exposure to every corner of the transportation world.
We've seen over the past few years how vital transportation is to the economy. Supply chain issues have been in the news throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with bottlenecks causing shortages in some key goods and helping to prompt fears of inflation. We've also seen the government and private sector pledge to invest massive sums in new transportation projects to ease the gridlock, creating potential opportunities for investors.
Given how broad the sector is, transportation is a natural fit for an exchange-traded fund, or ETF. An ETF allows investors to make one purchase and acquire shares in an entire range of companies operating in a single sector.
Here's are some of the top ETFs for investors looking for exposure to the transportation industry without having to buy a basket of individual companies.
The iShares US Transportation ETF (IYT  -0.54%) is the largest sector ETF, with $1.23 billion in net assets of of April 14, 2022. It has a broad target, attempting to provide exposure to U.S. airline, railroad, and trucking companies, and also mixing in some technology-infused transportation disruptors.
Overall, railroads make up 30.1% of the fund, while air freight and logistics companies comprise 28.7%, trucking has 21%, airlines take up 17%, and marine companies make up 1.6%. The iShares US Transportation ETF has an expense ratio of 0.41%.
The SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -0.38%) provides a broad view of the industry, defining transportation as air freight, airlines, airport services, trucks, rail, marine businesses, and port infrastructure. The ETF had $808 million in assets under management as of April 2022 and had 52 companies in its portfolio. The ETF is set up to track the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index.
Overall, airlines make up 34.8% of the fund, while trucking comprise 34.5%, air freight has 16.8%, marine makes up 7.8%, and railroads constitute 6.2%. The SPDR S&P Transportation ETF has an expense ratio of 0.35%.
The First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF (FTXR  0.2%) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Smart Transportation Index, which takes a pretty broad view of transportation. You'll see a lot more emphasis on personal transportation, including autos, in this list. The ETF had $211.7 million in assets as of April 14, 2022.
As of Dec. 31, 2021, trucking made up 17.5% of the ETF's assets, with rail comprising 17%, automobiles having 15.7%, and airlines making up 13.2%. The First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF has an expense ratio of 0.60%.
The SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF (HAIL  0.88%) is set up to generally track the Kensho Smart Transportation Index, seeking out companies with products and services that are pushing transportation into the digital age. That includes investments in autonomous vehicles, drones, and next-generation transportation systems.
Automakers account for 18.5% of the portfolio. Auto parts manufacturers make up 15%, construction machinery comprise 14.1%, semiconductors account for 11.4%, and electronic equipment has 6.6%. Overall, 18 subsectors are represented in the ETF.
The SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF has an expense ratio of 0.45%.
The Direxion Daily Transportation Bull 3X Shares (TPOR  -1.81%) ETF uses leverage to try to provide three times the returns of the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index. The strategy has a lot more potential upside than a traditional index-focused ETF but also a lot more risk. Leveraged ETFs tend to be more expensive to own, which is true in this case. The ETF has about $43.25 million in assets.
Overall, 60.1% of the ETF is invested in ""road and rail"" companies, while 26.5% is in air freight and logistics, 7.8% in airlines, and 5.6% in marine. The Direxion Daily Transportation Bull 3X Shares has an expense ratio of 0.98%.
The SmartETFs Smart Transportation and Technology ETF (NYSEMKT:MOTO) is designed to invest in the companies that will lead the evolution of transportation, including autonomous vehicles, flying taxis, electric powertrains, and transportation as a service. By its nature, this is a much more tech-centric list of holdings than a traditional transportation ETF. Investors might consider it a good way to invest in industry innovation without tying too much capital to one speculative company.
The SmartETFs Smart Transportation and Technology ETF has an expense ratio of 0.68%.
These companies can help your portfolio get where you want it to go.
Investing in exchange-traded funds of industrial companies is a way to play this vital sector.
The interesting thing about transports is that while the sector is vital to the economy, a lot of the individual companies have not been long-term winners. Subsectors such as airlines and truckers tend to be cyclical in nature, meaning the stocks tend to ebb and flow along with the economy.
These types of sectors -- where there is strong potential for future growth, but individual companies tend to post choppy performances -- are ripe for ETF investing because it gives an investor exposure to the broader trends without the risks that come with trying to pick individual winners.
The world needs well-functioning transportation systems, and the promise of technology has the potential to reinvent large portions of the transportation economy over time. A transportation ETF gives an investor a chance to go along for the ride while minimizing the risk of buying a lemon.","Transportation exchange-traded funds (ETFs) give investors exposure to a basket of stocks belonging to a broad range of companies in the transportation sector. The sector is composed of companies that build infrastructure, manufacture vehicles or other equipment, and provide services for the industry. This includes airlines, railroads, trucking, and logistics companies. Some notable companies in this sector include Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL), CSX Corp. (CSX), and General Motors Co. (GM).
Over the past year, the transportation sector has benefited from the reopening of the economy, the passage of the infrastructure bill by the U.S. Congress, and rising use of electric vehicles.

Payroll4Free remains free for up to 25 employees, with a monthly fee assessed if you exceed that number. It also charges your business a small fee ($15/month) if you opt to have Payroll4Free file and pay your payroll taxes.
You can also opt to use Payroll4Free's bank in order to fund direct deposit, though Payroll4Free notes that most of its customers choose to use their own banks for direct deposit.
You can import data from a time clock into Payroll4Free, and the application also lets you export payroll data directly to your accounting software application. Payrolls must be processed manually each pay period as there is no automatic pay option available in Payroll4Free, and the application is not able to handle employee reimbursements, nor does it offer mobile access.
The one major gripe I have with Payroll4Free has nothing to do with its features or functionality but instead is about the initial setup process, which the software completes for you.
Having Payroll4Free set up the initial application does not save you any time, and I don't like sharing a copy of an employee's W-4 with anyone, even a payroll vendor, since it contains sensitive personal identification information.
Payroll4Free uses a grid-style data-entry screen throughout the application. The grid provides a nice view of all of your employees, but there are no individual employee records available to track additional information.
There are a few other notable features in Payroll4Free.
The main reason businesses choose to use full-service payroll is for tax preparation and filing purposes. While this is an optional feature in Payroll4Free that you have to pay for, the cost is so low that there's no reason not to take advantage of it.
If you choose not to use the tax service, you will still have access to the completed forms, which you can file on your own. You will also be responsible for paying the taxes on a timely basis.
Payroll4Free lets you pay both employees and contractors, with the option to pay contractors available in the new employee setup screen. If the new hire is a contractor, you can choose to process a 1099 at year end versus a W-2, which is a nice feature, particularly for a free program.
An added bonus: If you opt to have Payroll4Free handle your payroll taxes, it will also take care of both W-2 and 1099 processing.
One of the most useful features found in Payroll4Free is the employee portal, which provides your employees with access to both current and historic pay stubs as well as year-end forms such as W-2s. The portal also lets your employees view their current vacation and sick time totals as well as make updates to their personal information.
Payroll4Free does offer good reporting options, with users able to view and print reports that detail earnings, taxes, benefits, accrued time off, and detailed payroll journal reports. Reports offer little in the way of customization capability, but they do include all of the details you need for your business.
While there is no direct integration available in Payroll4Free, you can easily export payroll data from the application into a variety of popular accounting software applications. As mentioned earlier, you can also import time clock data directly into Payroll4Free.
Aside from slow onboarding, navigation in Payroll4Free is easy. The application uses a slightly outdated interface with a small menu bar at the top of the screen and a series of tiles representing all payroll-related features. Clicking on the desired tile will take you to a grid-style entry screen where you can add employees, enter hours, and process payroll.
There is no option to run payroll automatically, so you'll have to input the hours worked each pay period, even for salaried employees. The employee grid offers a nice view of all employee details, and you have the option to pay your employees with direct deposit or by check.
Payroll4Free is free. If you choose to use the optional tax-filing service, which will file all tax-related reports and remittances for you, the cost is $15 a month -- still quite affordable.
The only other fee involved is if you need to pay more than 25 employees, but at that point, moving to a different payroll application would likely be a better idea.
A really nice feature Payroll4Free offers is its free telephone and email support, particularly in light of the fact that the application itself is available at no cost. Access to additional help resources is also available from within the application.
It may be difficult to wrap your head around the idea that a business provides payroll services free for up to 25 employees. I know it was for me.
However, slow onboarding aside, Payroll4Free truly does offer a solid payroll option at no cost, with a lot of really useful features including direct deposit, an employee portal, and the ability to import and export data to a variety of third-party software applications.
Another handy feature is the ability to outsource payroll tax processing, including remittances, to Payroll4Free, albeit at a small cost.
While Payroll4Free may not be for everyone, it's certainly worth considering, particularly for those operating on a limited budget.
The downside is that while it's nice that Payroll4Free handles product setup, that actually makes it more difficult for small business owners, as they still have to complete an employee information sheet for all employees as well as provide other legal documents to Payroll4Free.
If standard payroll services are not in your budget, Payroll4Free is definitely worth considering. It offers a good selection of features that small businesses could certainly use. Just be sure to read the rather lengthy legal disclaimer before you sign any agreements. One final word of caution: The software contains ads, which helps make it free, so be sure to take that into consideration.
Yes, it really is free payroll software. The software includes ads in the application that help to pay for it. However, if you want to use Payroll4Free's bank for direct deposit or have it process and pay payroll taxes for you, you will be charged a small fee.
Yes, you can, although you will have to be running Windows on your Mac in order to access the application.
While there is no direct integration, Payroll4Free does offer excellent import and export capabilities, so you'll be able to export payroll files to your accounting software application. You can also import data from a time clock system directly into Payroll4Free.","If payroll software simply isn’t in your budget, Payroll4Free offers all the services you’ll need to ensure your employees are paid on time and that you stay compliant with tax laws. While this free option won’t offer access to features like mobile payroll management and multiple employee rate management, it could be a great solution for a new startup or established small business not looking to exceed 25 employees. For business owners that want extra features and sleek interfaces, or have more than 25 employees, check out our list of alternatives.
Payroll4Free handles most of the setup process for you, though you will have to manually input your employees’ W-4 information. You’ll also need to establish each employee’s salary or hourly rate, as well as their current vacation time. Then, you'll set up direct deposits for each employee using your own bank (unless you opt to pay $15 per month to use Payroll4Free’s bank).
Once set up, you can integrate or export your time-clocking software data directly into Payroll4Free to make calculating paychecks quick and easy. If you are using direct deposit, your employees’ paychecks will automatically go into their bank accounts every pay period, with the necessary taxes being withheld. It is then your responsibility to report and deposit these taxes (unless you pay $15 per month for Payroll4Free to handle this). Vacation hours will be calculated as they’re taken.
If you run into any issues, Payroll4Free offers customer service support via phone or email.
No or low cost: Even if you decide to pay $15 per month to have Payroll4Free handle your taxes, it’s still an extremely affordable solution.
Easy to use: While the interface looks a bit outdated, this free software is simple to set up and use, making it ideal for companies that do not want to spend a lot of time dealing with payroll software.
Provides all essential payroll functions: You won’t get any bells or whistles with this payroll software, but you will get a solid payroll management system that does everything you need to keep your business operating smoothly.
Integrates with popular accounting software: Many small businesses use QuickBooks or other accounting platforms and Payroll4Free allows you to import data quickly with these programs.
Software only manages up to 25 employees: Although Payroll4Free can handle additional employees, you’ll pay a monthly fee for additional employees, which can make this platform less than ideal for medium to large businesses.
Limited to Windows: Payroll4Free works best on PCs, but can be used on Macs — only if they’re running Windows.
Ads: You will have ads running on your payroll software from time to time. These ads are what allow the service to remain free.
No mobile application: One of the drawbacks of this free payroll service is the lack of a mobile app to help you manage your payroll while on-the-go.
Payroll4Free has a basic free plan with a few optional upgrades. The free plan allows you to manage your payroll for no charge as long as you have 25 or fewer employees. You can use Payroll4Free if you have more than 25 employees, but you will incur a monthly payment processing fee of $35 for each group of 25 employees after the first 25.
If you would like Payroll4Free to deposit and handle your company’s payroll taxes automatically, you’ll be charged $15 per month for this service. In addition, if you choose to use Payroll4Free’s bank to handle direct deposit payroll transfers, Payroll4Free will charge you $15 per month. If you opt into both services, you’ll be charged $30 per month.
Choice of direct deposit or paper checks (you must use your own bank for the free version).
Ability to pay full-time, part-time and contract employees.
Access to automatic federal, state and local tax calculations and paperwork (you must make your own deposits and file all required forms for the free version).
Online employee portals for easy access to paystubs and W-2s.
Reporting options (earnings, benefits, payroll journal reports, etc.).
Integration with accounting, bank and time clock software.
If you’re feeling like Payroll4Free sounds too good to be true, you’re not alone. Based on Payroll4Free reviews from the Better Business Bureau (BBB), however, this service really does live up to its promises.
Better Business Bureau: 4 out of 5 stars; rated A+.
Capterra: 2.9 out of 5 stars.
G2 Crowd: 4.5 out of 5 stars.
Note that Capterra and G2 Crowd's ratings are based on a small handful of reviews. The same goes for BBB's 4-star review. The only negative BBB review discusses the long intake process, which other users have noted but found tolerable. Reviewers on Capterra mentioned that the learning curve was challenging.
Gusto: Ideal for small businesses looking to automate payroll processing with reliable software for an affordable cost. You’ll receive all basic payroll functionality — direct deposit, PTO tracking, employee portals, tax withholdings and deposits, etc. — as well as options to purchase employee management and HR resources. Other optional add-ons include flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts and commuter benefits. Gusto also has a handy mobile app to manage your payroll services. Monthly plans start at $40 per month, plus an additional $6 per month per employee.
ADP: Top option for small businesses looking for robust features and a payroll service that can scale with their company. This well-known payroll processing option offers four separate payroll plans with two specifically designed around small businesses. Each plan offers different tiers, so you can customize the exact service that best fits your business needs. On the downside, you’ll need to reach out to ADP online or via the phone to find out pricing, since all plans offer fully customized pricing.
PrimePay: Great for small businesses that need in-depth reporting and HR administrative tools built into their payroll service price. This payroll service offers the complete tools you’ll need to manage your payroll, as well as new hire reporting and onboarding options, tax filing and reporting services, HR resources and new applicant tracking data (for additional fees). Pricing varies depending on the option you choose, but starts at $42 per pay period. There is also a per-check fee.
Paychex: Good choice for small businesses looking for mobile app accessibility and flexible, customized payroll plans. In addition to basic payroll services, Paychex also offers time tracking, HR resources, tax filing and administrative tools and payroll reporting. This cloud-based solution has a mobile app to quickly handle your payroll needs on-the-go too. To find out pricing, you’ll need to reach out to Paychex with the options you want and the number of employees your business has.",Fool,Nerdwallet,,,
0.8,"Life insurance can be tricky to figure out with its complex rules and choices among competing opportunities. With the wrong information, you could end up with the wrong policy which wastes your money and doesn't properly protect your loved ones. This article will briefly examine the top 10 misconceptions surrounding life insurance to help make your road to coverage a little smoother.
Single people may need at least enough life insurance to cover their outstanding personal debts and medical and funeral bills. If you are uninsured, you may leave a legacy of unpaid expenses for your family or other loved ones to deal with. If you have enough cash to cover these expenses, whether you need life insurance depends on your future goals.
Maybe. For a single person of modest means, employer-provided term coverage may actually be enough. But if you have a spouse or other dependents, or anticipate needing additional funds upon your death to pay estate taxes, additional coverage may be necessary.
Employer-paid or employer-provided term insurance provides convenient guaranteed coverage at a low cost. However, it will only be available while you remain with your employer and it does not provide permanent coverage throughout your lifetime.4You may want a policy outside of work so you don't suddenly lose your protection after leaving your job.
For many people, this is often true. However, those with sizable assets may be better off self-insuring. When you self-insure, you use your own savings to cover your medical and funeral costs while providing for your loved ones. You save money by self-insuring as you aren't paying for the cost of setting up a policy.6 However, you might still decide to buy a policy to create a larger inheritance or as a backup in case you spend down your savings more quickly than expected.
This is not necessarily true. Term life starts out less expensive than permanent life insurance, which gives you more money to invest. However, term gets more expensive over time and can become prohibitively high in later years. Permanent policies like whole life do not increase your premium as you get older. The total premium outlay for a permanent policy may actually end up less than what you'd spend on term coverage that keeps getting more expensive over time.
Term coverage eventually ends as insurers set a maximum age limit for renewals. Those who know for certain they must be covered at death should consider some amount of permanent coverage.
Permanent life insurance also builds cash value which you can withdraw or borrow against while alive. While cash value may not grow as quickly as investing in the stock market, it's still extra savings. Ask yourself whether you would truly invest the difference after buying term or if you'd spend it. Some might prefer buying cash value life insurance as the monthly premiums essentially force you to save money over time.
In theory, the long-run investment return of a variable universal life policy (VUL) should outearn a straight universal life policy but that's not guaranteed. Your cash value growth in a VUL depends on the performance of your investments. Poor market performance may result in a a lower cash value than someone with a straight universal life policy. If you prefer to keep it safe, universal life policies with no risk of losses could be the better option.
A return-of-premium (ROP) rider might seem like an excellent deal as you get all your money back if you outlive the term of your life insurance policy. However, you need to pay more per month for this feature. Consider the opportunity cost. Do you think you'd be better off investing the extra cash or would you prefer to play it safe and get your premiums back from the ROP rider on the life insurance?
Doubtful. Perhaps by the end of your career, you'll have saved enough to cover all your needs and to provide for your family. But you take a big chance when you depend solely on your investments in the early years of your life, especially if you have dependents. If you die early in your career, chances are your investments will not be nearly enough to pay off your mortgage or to support your young children. If you want to keep as much money as possible for your investments, consider a low-cost term policy. You'll protect your loved ones while still keeping most of your money for investing.
Do you have the assets to cover your final expenses and the ongoing needs of your loved ones after you're gone? If not, you probably need a life insurance policy to cover them.
Most people with dependents need life insurance. If you're single and have enough money to cover your final medical and funeral costs, life insurance coverage may be optional.  If you have considerable savings, like at the end of your career, you could also self-insure to provide for your family rather than buying a life insurance policy.
A quick rule of thumb says you need at least ten years of your annual salary. The exact answer for most people is more complicated. Some people need more, some less, and some don't need life insurance at all.
Think of your personal situation. Are you single or married with a family? Do you have significant debts such as an outstanding mortgage? What assets do you have on hand: cash, stocks, property, and so forth? You can review the situation with a life insurance agent to determine whether you need coverage to fill gaps in your plan.
These are just some of the more prevalent misunderstandings concerning life insurance. You probably should not leave life insurance out of your budget unless you have enough assets to cover your expenses after you're gone. For more information, consult your life insurance agent or financial advisor, and be sure to do your research to determine which of the best life insurance companies is right for you.

You may have heard that it’s too expensive or only healthy people can qualify for coverage, but the truth may surprise you.
We break down six common life insurance myths so you can better understand your options and get coverage that’s right for you.
» MORE: How does life insurance work?
The payout from a life insurance policy is not affected by whether the policyholder received or did not receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Plus, applicants are not denied coverage solely based on the fact that they received the vaccine. In fact, vaccines often lead to lower mortality rates because they reduce the risk of dying from diseases.
Concerns over whether life insurance covers deaths from COVID-19 are also largely unfounded. In most cases, life insurance policies cover infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.
One of the biggest myths about life insurance is that it comes with a hefty price tag. Over half of Americans think term life insurance costs three times as much as it does, according to the 2022 Insurance Barometer Study from marketing and research firm LIMRA and life insurance-focused nonprofit Life Happens.
In reality, the average cost of life insurance can be relatively low, especially for younger generations. That’s because the younger and healthier you are, the higher your life expectancy.
Use online calculators to find out how much life insurance you need. Once you know the type of policy and coverage amount you want, be sure to compare life insurance quotes from multiple companies to get the best price. If you’re unsure of where to start, speak with a fee-only financial advisor to better understand your options.
Although your mortality may not be top of mind when you’re young, getting coverage early can help you lock in low rates. This can be useful because the price of a policy can go up as you age.
Your future insurability is another factor to consider. If you develop a health condition before you buy coverage, your access to affordable life insurance may be restricted. Features like guaranteed insurability riders will allow you to purchase more coverage in the future without a medical exam.
Although insurers typically use your health to calculate rates and coverage amounts, it doesn't mean you can’t get life insurance with a pre-existing condition. In fact, some policies are built specifically for people with certain health conditions like diabetes.
You can skip the medical exam with simplified issue life insurance. These types of policies require only a short health questionnaire. If you don’t want your medical history to be a factor, consider guaranteed issue life insurance. Acceptance is guaranteed regardless of your health — as long as you’re within the eligible age range.
Life insurance isn’t just for breadwinners. For example, if a parent, sibling or friend co-signed on your mortgage, life insurance can help them pay it off if you die.
You can also use life insurance as an inheritance for someone who doesn't rely on you financially, like a niece or nephew. Similarly, if you support a charity or nonprofit, you can assign some or all of the death benefit to the organization.
Life insurance can also offer a financial safety net to small-business owners. For example, your partners can use the payout to buy out your share in the company.
Group life insurance through an employer is typically one or two times your salary, which may not be enough to support your loved ones.
Another factor to consider is portability. Free policies through work are often tied to employment, so if you leave your job, you may lose your coverage. Buying individual life insurance means you’re covered regardless of where you work.
When speaking with a licensed agent or financial advisor, ask them to walk you through each type of life insurance. One type of life insurance isn’t necessarily better than another; it’s about what’s right for you.",Investopedia,Nerdwallet,,,
0.8,,"You don’t have to choose whether to pay off student loans or buy a house. With the help of first-time home buyer programs, and if you’re able to build up enough emergency savings, you may be able to do both at the same time.
Here are three ways to decide if that’s possible for you.
For many student loan borrowers, the biggest hurdle to homebuying is coming up with a down payment. But many states offer first-time home buyer programs that will subsidize the down payment. Many lenders also offer mortgages that require far less than the traditional down payment of 20% of the home’s price.
Look into these options before despairing that it’s impossible to put tens of thousands of dollars down while paying off student loans. You may find it’s more feasible than you thought, especially when you choose a house you can afford.
At the same time, you’ll likely need to save more than you expected for items beyond the down payment. These include closing costs — which generally come to 2% to 5% of your home’s price — and home maintenance, furnishings and appliances. Plan to save 2% of your home's value per year for repairs and maintenance alone. Plus, you’ll need emergency savings left over to cover non-home expenses that might come up, like medical bills and car repairs.
Use a closing costs calculator to help you figure out how much extra to budget for. Add three months of your bare-bones expenses to that amount, and that’s how much you should plan to save in addition to the down payment.
If you feel defeated, try making a budget using the 50/30/20 plan, which encourages you to spend 50% of your income on necessities, 30% or less on wants and 20% or more on savings. That will give you a framework for saving and help you determine how long it will take.
To give yourself more flexibility to save, consider refinancing student loans, which could lower your interest rates and potentially your monthly payment. Refinancing turns multiple loans into one, at an interest rate based on your financial history. To qualify, you’ll need a credit score in the high 600s or above, solid income and a history of on-time debt payments.
Getting a lower monthly payment may mean stretching out the time it takes to pay off your loans, which could eat into your interest savings. Make sure you’re comfortable with that before refinancing in order to pay less per month.
» CALCULATE:  Should you refinance student loans?
If you can meet these goals while paying off loans, go for it. Buying a home while paying off student loans isn’t necessary, though. There’s nothing wrong with renting longer and taking more time to pay off debt. The decision, ultimately, depends on your personal homebuying timeline and how much you can save in advance.",Fool,Nerdwallet,,,
0.8,"Offering a range of life insurance products, including a guaranteed issue whole life policy, Farmers is an excellent choice for life insurance for individuals of almost all health conditions. You can also add riders to customize your policy as needed. However, you can’t get a quote without supplying personally identifying information, and you can’t apply without talking to an agent.
Life insurance through Farmers Insurance is not the same as life insurance through Farmer’s Life, which is based in Knoxville, Tennessee.
The Farmers Insurance Group of Companies (Farmers) was founded by John C. Tyler and Thomas E. Leavey as Farmers Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange in 1928. Based in Los Angeles, California, the duo started the business to sell auto insurance to rural farmers. Since then, the company has expanded beyond car insurance to home, business, life, and other insurance products. Farmers issues life insurance through Farmers New World Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary based in Bellevue, Washington. Farmers New World Life is licensed to sell life insurance in all states except New York.
For the graded benefit whole life policy, if you pass away within the first two years of coverage, your beneficiaries only receive 110% of the premiums you paid instead of the whole death benefit.
Compared to other insurance companies of its size, Farmers New World Life Insurance Company received fewer than expected customer complaints over the past three years. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) provides a complaint index for insurance companies based on the number of consumer complaints received and the company’s market share. An index of 1.00 indicates an expected number of complaints. An index under 1.00 indicates fewer complaints than expected for a company’s size, and a rating higher than 1.00 means the company received more complaints than expected.
Farmers is deemed to be financially strong by the independent insurance rating agency, AM Best, which assesses an insurer’s financial stability in order to project the company’s ability to pay claims long into the future. The financial strength of insurers is particularly critical when it comes to life insurance because buyers trust the insurer to deliver on a long-term promise.
Farmers offers several different types of life insurance.
Term life insurance is a form of insurance that guarantees the payment of a death benefit to the policy’s beneficiaries if the insured person dies before the end of a selected period. Farmers’ term policies can last for 10, 20, or 30 years and can be converted to a permanent policy. Term insurance does not have any savings component and generally provides no other value aside from the death benefit.
Whole life insurance is a type of permanent insurance that covers you for your entire life as long as you continue to pay premiums. Unlike term insurance, whole life has a cash value which accumulates tax-deferred and can be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals. Farmers offers several whole life products you can choose from.
Universal life insurance is a type of permanent insurance that offers both death benefit protection and the opportunity to build cash value that earns interest. Universal life policies are flexible. You can adjust how much you pay and how often your premiums are due, and you may be able to adjust the death benefit as well.
This policy is another type of permanent insurance. The cash value in indexed universal life insurance is linked to one or more market indexes, such as the S&P 500. If the market does well, you have the potential for growth. And since the money isn’t directly invested, your account is protected against losses if the index falls.
Variable universal life is a type of permanent insurance that lets you invest and grow the cash value through subaccounts that operate like mutual funds. Exposure to market fluctuations can generate high returns but may also result in substantial losses.
VUL is similar to variable life insurance, but unlike variable life, it allows you to change your premium payment amount.
Farmers offers a small whole life policy, which may also be referred to as a final expense policy or burial insurance. These types of policies are typically limited. With Farmers, there’s a maximum coverage amount of $30,000. This policy type is designed to cover your final expenses, such as funeral costs, medical bills, and outstanding debts (but your beneficiaries can use the funds however they need). You can get this type of policy without a medical exam.
A rider is an optional feature that you can add to your life insurance policy to customize your coverage and address additional insurance needs. Farmers offers several riders.
This option allows you to purchase additional coverage in the future without having to go through a medical exam. It's helpful if your health changes over time such that you may not qualify for additional coverage.
The child rider is an affordable way to add temporary coverage for your dependent children to your life insurance policy. When the child reaches adulthood, this rider can often be converted to a permanent policy.
This rider allows your insurance coverage to continue under certain conditions, such as if you become totally disabled and can't work to pay your premiums. It's a valuable option if you want financial protection for your family in case of an injury or illness.
This rider pays an additional death benefit if you die due to an accident. It can provide extra peace of mind if you're worried about accidental death.
Accelerated death benefits allow you to access some of your life insurance death benefit while you're still alive. However, you need to meet certain conditions in order to qualify. With the terminal illness rider, you can receive a portion of your death benefit if you have a terminal illness or injury that's expected to result in death in the near future. With Farmers, this rider is added to some policies for no additional cost.
The chronic illness rider is another accelerated death benefit that may be included on some policies from Farmers at no cost. It allows you to access your life insurance death benefit if you have a chronic, long-term illness, or injury that impacts your ability to perform at least two activities of daily living or if you suffer from a severe cognitive impairment.
Though they sound similar, chronic and critical illnesses aren't the same. A critical illness rider allows you to access your life insurance death benefit if you are diagnosed with a critical condition, such as cancer or a heart attack. This rider can help provide ongoing financial support for your family during your treatment and recovery process.
Farmers offers customer service support via phone or an online contact form on its website. Phone agents can be reached toll-free at 1-888-327-6335 from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday, with slightly shorter hours on the weekend.

Farmers life insurance earned 3 stars out of 5 for overall performance. NerdWallet’s ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula takes into account consumer experience, complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and financial strength ratings.
Farmers Simple Term is available for 18- to 65-year-olds for 10, 20 or 30 years. Coverage amounts start at $75,000, and premiums remain level throughout the term. This policy usually doesn’t require a medical exam or lab test, and you could get approved for coverage within 24 hours.
Farmers Value Term lasts 10, 20 or 30 years, with premiums that stay the same throughout your chosen term. This policy is open to those between the ages of 18 and 75 but requires a medical exam. Coverage starts at $150,000, with no maximum.
Farmers EssentialLife Simple Whole Life is open to people ages 15 days to 80 years old, with proceeds paid to age 121. Coverage starts at $15,000 and comes with a guaranteed death benefit, and premiums stay the same. To apply, you’ll need to answer a health questionnaire and potentially take a life insurance medical exam.
Farmers Graded Benefit Whole Life doesn’t require a medical exam. It’s marketed to people ages 18 to 80 who may have health issues but are able to take care of themselves. Premiums remain level, and policies earn a cash value over time, which Farmers guarantees. Once you’ve accumulated enough cash value, you can begin withdrawing money or taking out loans against your policy. The policy comes with a graded death benefit. This means if the policyholder dies of natural causes within the first two years, their beneficiaries will receive a payout equal to 110% of the premiums paid.
Universal life insurance. Like all universal life insurance policies, Farmers EssentialLife Universal Life offers flexible premiums, and has a cash value component that earns interest over time. The policy is open to people ages 15 days to 80 years old, with coverage starting at $50,000.
Indexed universal life insurance. Farmers Index Universal Life insurance targets people who want protection from underperforming markets. Portions of your premiums can remain in a short-term holding account earning 0.1%, be allocated to accounts indexed to the S&P 500 or S&P MARC 5% ER or placed in a fixed interest account paying a guaranteed minimum interest rate of 1%.
Over three years, Farmers has drawn close to the expected number of complaints to state regulators for a company of its size, according to a NerdWallet analysis of data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
The Farmers website has clear descriptions of each life insurance product and several resources for shoppers, including guidance determining which type of life insurance is right for them. You can log in to manage your policy and make payments.

To make the decision a little easier, we're comparing Xero and QuickBooks Online, side by side based on features, pricing, ease of use, and more.
Xero is an excellent accounting software option for startups and small business owners, and it’s particularly well suited for business owners who know absolutely nothing about accounting but still need to properly manage their finances.
The Xero accounting interface is clean and uncluttered, and new users have access to a demo company where they can manipulate data without worrying about entering or deleting important information.
QuickBooks Online, an offshoot of the popular QuickBooks Desktop application, is a good fit for small and growing businesses.
Originally designed for very small businesses, when compared to the desktop version, QuickBooks Online now offers growing businesses the option to use an application they won’t outgrow in a short amount of time.
Xero and QuickBooks Online both offer a ton of features all designed for small business owners.
While the vocabulary may vary between the two products, they both offer electronic banking, excellent invoicing, payment acceptance, and bill management capabilities.
Xero places its features into five main categories: Dashboard, Business, Accounting, Projects, and Contacts. Xero’s accounting dashboard offers a nice summary of your business, including bank balances, invoices owed, and total cash in and out of your business, with the dashboard completely customizable.
The Business category is where you’ll find invoicing, bills to pay, purchase orders, and products and services. The invoices option in Xero displays a nice summary view of all invoices and their current status.
Xero’s invoice entry screen, seen above, is clean and uncluttered with easy look-up options available for most fields. Once the invoice is completed, you can send it via email with online bill payment options included in the email. Once payment is received, Xero will automatically apply the payment if paid online, or you can process the payment during your regular bank reconciliation process.
The Accounting category in Xero is where you’ll handle all of your banking transactions, as well as manage your chart of accounts and financial statements. The Projects category lets you manage any projects and record time spent using the time tracking feature.
The Contacts category lets you manage all contacts, from customers to suppliers to contractors, from one location. Reporting in Xero is solid, with a variety of financial statements and management reports available.
A mobile app for both iOS and Android devices is available in Xero, offering the ability to handle common tasks such as receipt management, contact management, bank reconciliation, and invoice creation.
Like Xero, QuickBooks Online offers standard features like electronic banking, solid invoicing capability, bill management, and payment acceptance, but it breaks them down into more specific categories rather than lumping them together into one category.
User preference can play a role in which style you prefer, but generally, the more self-explanatory a central navigation screen is, the easier it is for new users to find their way around.
Entering an invoice in QuickBooks Online is simple, and it offers the ability to add a credit card or bank account number to a customer’s account – a nice feature that allows you to immediately process an online payment for that customer.
QuickBooks Online also gives you the option to have customer payments applied automatically once they’re deposited, or leave that option to the user. The Expense category lets you add vendor invoices and get them ready for payment, and QuickBooks Online lets you manage customers, vendors, and employees in the system, with a payroll option available through Intuit.
The Report Center in QuickBooks Online offers a central location to process reports, which include all standard financial statements as well as a healthy selection of management reports.
This one is a tie. Xero and QuickBooks Online offer very similar features and functionality along with summary dashboards to measure business health.
You tried importing data, but it’s not showing up. You’ve entered a transaction, but it won’t post. The product won’t let you log in. All of these things can cause extreme frustration, and you'll need the assistance of product support to solve these problems.
While both of these accounting tools offer a ton of help articles, knowledge bases, and robust user communities, who will win in the Xero, QuickBooks Online comparison in the battle of support personnel?
Xero's accounting functionalities are fairly simple to navigate, so it’s likely these resources will be sufficient if and when something goes wrong.
You'll rarely be asking yourself how to use QuickBooks Online as they offer plenty of guidance throughout the application; users can click on the question mark anytime they need assistance.
The winner here is QuickBooks Online. Live support will always beat chat or text support. You may never need to call support, but it’s nice to know it’s an option.
An important though often overlooked component of any software product is how easy it is to use.
That’s one of the most important reasons for downloading a demo (if possible) of any accounting application in which you may be interested, because preferences differ, and something I like may be something you absolutely hate.
For those who like everything in neat compartments, Xero may be your best option. Instead of the “add what you need” process many other accounting software applications employ, Xero requires you to set up your business completely before you can start using the software.
If you just want to get started and add things as you go, Xero may not be for you.
Xero’s main entry screen uses a menu bar at the top of the screen for access to system functions. This pared-down menu makes it easy for new users to find their way around the application without too much trouble.
Help is accessible from any data-entry screen, and a demo company is available for those who want to enter practice transactions without worrying about messing up their own data.
For those on the go, Xero has a mobile app accounting tool for both iOS and Android devices, though the app does not give you access to all of the features found in the full version. You can import data such as customers into Xero, but you’ll have to download the CSV file template in Xero in order to import the data correctly.
The QuickBooks Online setup is designed to be, well, quick. You can enter as much or as little information as you need, and simply add the rest when it’s necessary.
One of the things I like about this Xero alternative is the fact that you can place your cursor over one of the categories listed in the vertical menu to see what features are available in that category.
For those moving their small business' accounting over from another application, you can import data into QuickBooks Online using the Import Data function.
The QuickBooks Online accounting dashboard provides much of the same information that’s included in Xero’s dashboard, but it also provides quick links to tasks such as invoicing, time tracking, and payroll.
The edge goes to Xero for ease of use. Its data-entry screens are more minimalist than those of QuickBooks Online, and its invoice and billing entries require less in the way of data entry. However, QuickBooks Online edges out Xero for dashboard features.
Pricing levels for Xero and QuickBooks Online are very similar, with both applications offering three pricing plans. For example, both mid-level plans are similar in price and scope, with the Growing plan in Xero costing you $32, while QuickBooks Online’s Plus plan is $35.
A 50% discount will be applied to the above prices for the first two months.
Xero’s Early plan offers limited capability (send five invoices, enter five bills, reconcile limited bank transactions), while the Growing plan includes unlimited invoicing and bill processing, along with unlimited bank transactions.
Features found only in the Established plan include multicurrency capability, project tracking, and expense management capability.
A 50% discount will be applied to the above prices for the first three months.
All QuickBooks Online plans include income and expense tracking, invoicing, payment acceptance, estimates, sales tax tracking, and receipt organization.
Moving up to the more expensive plans will get you features such as inventory, custom user permissions, and accelerated invoicing, with all plans providing the basic functionality your business needs.
QuickBooks Online is the winner, here. While Xero might be a good application to start with, growing businesses will appreciate the scalability offered by QuickBooks Online.
Yes, QuickBooks' accounting tools do come in a little higher in overall pricing, but the plan options are more flexible and offer more features than Xero’s plans.
The ability to integrate a software product with other applications can increase its functionality tremendously. Both Xero and QuickBooks Online offer excellent integration with hundreds of apps.
Xero offers integration with more than 700 apps in a variety of categories, including payment acceptance apps such as Stripe, PayPal, and GoCardless, as well as CRM, inventory, payroll, point of dale, e-commerce, and time tracking applications.
QuickBooks Online offers integration with hundreds of apps, making it great for small business owners. These integrations including PayPal, TSheets, Bill Pay for QuickBooks Online, and Stripe, with apps available for inventory, payroll, CRM, and time tracking.
Xero is the winner in this category, offering more than 700 apps that can connect with its core application.
One of the major differences between Xero and QuickBooks Online is the setup process.
Xero's accounting functions use a very structured setup process that requires eight distinct steps, whereas QuickBooks Online allows users to enter only the bare minimum and get started quickly, adding additional details when they become necessary.
While this, again, can come down to user preference, I like the ability to just jump in and get started.
Xero uses a very structured setup process, which is great for those who like to have everything in place prior to starting work.
QuickBooks Online's accounting software has a looser setup structure, allowing you to enter the bare minimum and add the rest as you go along.
QuickBooks Online is the setup winner for me, but you more organized folks may disagree.
QuickBooks Online by a nose, a very small nose. While there are some distinct benefits found in this QuickBooks' competitor, their offers the one thing Xero does not: live support.
I have learned never to underestimate the importance of live product support, particularly when it comes to managing my money. Another benefit is that QuickBooks Online is better for small businesses, as you're able to scale with your growing company.","Xero and QuickBooks Online are both powerful accounting software solutions for small businesses. However, when you compare features, QuickBooks Online inches ahead for its stronger feature set, ease of sharing with accountants and customer support.
This doesn't mean QuickBooks Online is the right choice for all businesses, though. Xero's unlimited-users feature makes it a winner among larger businesses and well-established small businesses that require more than five users. It’s also less expensive than QuickBooks Online and a bit easier to use, thanks to its customizable dashboard and simple layout.
Has robust reporting tools and report customization options, basic inventory tracking in all plans and a capable mobile app; Early plan limits the number of invoices and bills.

All plans include 24/7 live chat support; phone support is available 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. PST Monday through Friday, and 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. PST Saturday and Sunday.

Includes project tracking tools in most expensive plan; limited transaction tracking tags; lacks industry-specific reports; users with multiple businesses must pay for separate subscriptions.
Includes project tracking tools in most expensive plan; limited transaction tracking tags; lacks industry-specific reports; users with multiple businesses must pay for separate subscriptions.
All QuickBooks Online plans support unlimited invoices. Xero’s Early plan, recommended for self-employed people or brand-new businesses, allows 20 invoices per year. If you only send out an invoice or two each month, the Early plan is an affordable option at $13 per month. Otherwise, you’ll have to bump up your subscription or consider QuickBooks Online plans.
QuickBooks Online allows users to claim expenses and match them to photos of receipts in all plans, whereas Xero requires Xero Expenses, an additional feature only included in the highest-tier Established plan. If snapping photos of receipts to claim expenses on the go is a key mobile feature you’d like to have, regardless of plan level, QuickBooks Online might be a better fit.
Both Xero and QuickBooks Online have their own versions of transaction tracking tags, but QuickBooks Online is the winner in this arena. Xero lets users create two active tracking categories, while QuickBooks Online allows users to create 40 in the Simple Start, Essentials and Plus plans. QuickBooks Online’s Advanced plan allows for unlimited tag groups. The more categories you create, the more reports you can run to get a better idea of how your business functions and where there's room to grow.
Both accounting software products let users invite their accountants by email. The process shouldn’t take more than a couple of minutes. If you’re located in the United States, though, there’s a better chance your accountant is familiar with QuickBooks Online than Xero. QuickBooks Online is an industry standard with more than 5 million users worldwide. If you count QuickBooks Desktop users, that number rises to 8 million. With more than 3 million users worldwide, Xero is popular but not as ubiquitous as QuickBooks Online.
Business owners who prefer working through a hiccup on the phone will favor QuickBooks Online. The company offers phone support Monday through Friday from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT and Saturday to Sunday from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. PT. Advanced plan subscribers get 24/7 customer support. Xero doesn’t provide customers with a phone number but will call you if you provide your contact info.
If you need to give accounting access to more than five people, Xero could be the better option for you. QuickBooks Online’s most popular Plus plan tops out at five users; its highest-tier Advanced plan allows up to 25 users, but that plan is expensive at $200 per month. In contrast, all Xero plans offer unlimited users and its highest-tier Established plan is a more affordable $70 per month.
Xero is known for having a simple, sleek layout that could feel more approachable to business owners who are new to accounting basics or don't have the background knowledge to leverage QuickBooks Online's full functionality. You can do a lot with QuickBooks Online, but all the options may feel like information overload starting out.
If you can’t justify the $90-per-month QuickBooks Online Plus plan, you won't get inventory management, because QuickBooks Online's lower-tier plans don’t come with it. This could be a real shortcoming for small online retail businesses, for instance, that need to keep track of their products and the materials used to make them. All of Xero’s plans come with inventory management so business owners can track what’s in stock and which products are selling.
Just keep in mind that unlike the inventory feature in QuickBooks Online’s higher-tier plans, Xero doesn’t let users set up reorder points that flag when stock is running low.
Wave Accounting is a free accounting solution for very small service-based businesses, contractors, freelancers and consultants. If you can’t justify paying for QuickBooks Online or Xero or they have too many features your business doesn’t need, Wave might be an ideal alternative. It has comparable invoicing features, but lacks an audit trail and doesn’t integrate with third-party apps.
With a free plan and paid plans starting at $20 per month, Zoho Books has plans for most budgets. Higher-tier plans include unique features, like workflow rules, on top of tools that help you measure project profitability. Phone support and live chat support are available 24/5 to all paying customers, but third-party integrations are limited compared to QuickBooks Online and Xero.
Pricing: $17 per month and up.
FreshBooks can be a good option for freelancers and contractors looking for an affordable, simple accounting software. There’s time tracking in all plans and phone support is available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET. Monday through Friday. The first two plan tiers put a limit on billable clients, but not on invoices.",Fool,Nerdwallet,,,
