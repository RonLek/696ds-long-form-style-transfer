1,"Good morning. My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Uber first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Mr.
Balaji Krishnamurthy, head of investor relations, you may begin your conference.
Thanks, Emma. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber's first quarter 2022 earnings presentation. On the call today, we have Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi; and CFO, Nelson Chai. During today's call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, are included in the press release, supplemental slides and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com. As a reminder, these numbers are unaudited and may be subject to change. Certain statements in this presentation and on this call are forward-looking statements. Such statements can be identified by terms such as belief, expect, intend, and may.
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Uber Technologies wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements we make today, except as required by law. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today as well as the risks and uncertainties described our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2021 and in other filings made with the SEC when available. We published our quarterly earnings press release, prepared remarks, and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website about an hour ago, and we ask you to review those documents if you haven't already.
We will open the call to questions following brief opening remarks from Dara. With that, let me hand it over to Dara.
Thanks, Balaji. We delivered a very strong quarter across the board with record results on the top and bottom line. After two years of persistent and sometimes unpredictable impacts across our business, our Q1 results resoundingly affirm that we're on a strong path emerging out of the pandemic. Our focus on profitable growth, product innovation and operational excellence over the last two years has set us apart from the pack.
Our mobility team is demonstrating phenomenal execution, growing both demand and supply faster than competitors and rapidly innovating to roll out new accretive offerings, all while delivering record margins despite the macro turbulence that we all see. Delivery has continued to surprise us positively as demand has remained resilient in a reopening world, and we expect top-line growth and profitability to expand through 2022. Finally, freight reached its first profitable quarter as well. We're keenly aware that the market is placing a high value on companies generating and expanding profits as interest rates rise.
We're leading the industry in this respect. Our focus over the past two years on profitable growth has resulted in the strong top and bottom lines that we delivered in Q1. We're confident that our leadership position, our global scale, and our innovation and platform advantages will allow us to deliver significant profitability and durable growth as investors rightly expect from globally scaled technology platforms. We're committed to taking all necessary actions to continue to deliver industry-leading margins and free cash flow generation, along with a disciplined capital allocation strategy.
We've never been more optimistic about our prospects and we're determined to execute as a team to bring that optimism to fruition. With that, let's go to questions.
Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, sort of on users and on drivers.
I was wondering, Dara, in the past, you've shared stats about some of your cross-platform adoption, 17% of users in the past, etc. Any updates on what you're seeing on a cross-platform adoption for your users and drivers and just some of the benefits of your multiproduct offering integration you're seeing from that is the first one. And the second one, just a comment about the expected acceleration in delivery in the back half. Anything you'd call out there on what you're seeing on user growth, cohort or anything sort of gives you confidence in the ability to continue to celebrate the delivery business throughout potentially weaker consumer?
Yes, definitely. As far as our cross-platform usage, it remains strong and consistent really with what we went through with you at Investor Day. And one of the interesting factors that we're seeing is that as mobility is opening up, mobility of significant number of new riders are coming on onto the platform, and that gives us the opportunity to then upsell those new mobility riders to Eats, to our grocery offerings, and then ultimately to our Uber One membership plan, which is the only membership plan globally that offers both mobility and delivery offerings as well. So what we're seeing is really kind of a swelling of new audience coming in, that then we can essentially upsell our cross-platform products and then ultimately membership as well.
So we're super optimistic about all of the platform investments that we're making and the potential there. We've already launched, obviously, Uber One in the U.S. We announced launches in Mexico and Germany. We've got a number of other launches teed up for the balance of the year.
And I will remind everyone that members spend 2.7 times more than nonmembers. So as we move over, as new customers come in, we cross-sell them into the platform, we cross-sell them into membership, we can increase the spend and the lock-in that our platform provides in a way that no other monoline player can, and it's -- we already have the formula down and it's about rolling out Uber One globally and then applying the same formula over and over again. Then on the cross-platform side, the side that's invisible to I'd say most investors, is on the earner side. And we talked about how our efforts to sign up earners now are truly cross-platform.
We bring you in not to drive or to deliver, but we bring you in to earn on the Uber platform. The success there has been very, very significant. You heard I think last night, one of our competitors in the U.S. having challenges or at least looking to lean into driver supply.
Our active drivers in the U.S. and Canada are up 70% on a year-on-year basis in April. New drivers were up 121% year on year in April, and it's because we're bringing new drivers on not as Uber Rides, not as Uber Eats, but as Uber as a platform and to earn in any way, shape or form that they can on the platform, and that's proving to be a structural advantage from what we can see versus the competition, both locally and then we think ultimately, globally.
And then a question on back half for delivery.
Yes, of course. Back half for the delivery goes, it really is about the European reopenings and comps. So some of the countries, France, for example, is reopening. It is a spectacular news for mobility business.
It makes the delivery comps a little bit tougher. So I think you'll see Q2 growth rates similar to Q1, and then we expect Q3 and Q4 to accelerate. And I think you've also seen for us as a team, we've delivered on what we say we're going to do. So we're pretty confident of acceleration in the second half.
The other factor that's going to affect the second half is that with new verticals, actually very recently, along with the Albertsons deal, we are now launching the native stack of Cornershop, essentially grocery, on the Uber Eats platform. It's very, very early, but we see substantial improvement in customer experience, and we see substantial improvements in terms of conversion on the Uber Eats native stack. So we think that the U.S. growth rate that is already pretty high, is going to significantly accelerate in the second half of the year, which again gives us confidence as the delivery growth rates in the second half of the year.
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask two on the mobility product side, Dara. Just if you could talk a little bit about the efforts so far with upfront fare and destination info and some of the key benefits and the rollout timing there. And then also about -- around UberX Share, how that's reimagined and the key points of differentiation.
Yes, absolutely. As far as upfront destination, one of the most significant complaints that we get from our earners and our drivers is that they don't know where the upfront destination is. And if you go back to the origins of this business and how pricing was built, pricing originally was based on time and distance, and that comes from, let's say, the taxi days. But the fact is that based on the destination, the value of a ride, which may take the same amount of time and distance for a driver, may be very different based on the destination.
So if you're going from the airport into Central San Francisco and you're going to get a ride as soon as you drop the person off, that's a pretty valuable ride. If you carry a passenger, same time and distance, into the outskirts of the neighborhood and then have to drive back empty for, let's say, 30 or 40 minutes, that's not a ride that's particularly valuable to an earner. And if you're purely basing your charges on time and distance, essentially those two rides are priced equally. We think that's a bug in our system.
And it certainly does not serve the best interests of the earners. So now with our new system, we display the full information of the ride, especially what the destination is. Our algorithms are then able to take signal, let's say, the trip out to the outskirts where the drivers have to come back empty, we will then price up that trip so that the earner trip earns the fair value of that fare and also knows exactly what they're accepting or not accepting. That also improves the consumer experience because cancellation rates, once drivers understand what the destination is, go down as well.
There's a huge amount of technology that has to go into developing this kind of a system because essentially, your pricing systems have to get signal based on earner behavior in order to hone in the pricing to truly price kind of that trip based on the market clearing price that earners are willing to accept that trip with. So there's a huge amount of ML data work that goes into that system. But we think it's fundamentally a better way. And the feedback that we're getting from our driver partners has been quite positive.
It's a big change though, I'll tell you. And there's a lot of debugging going on. There's a lot of algorithmic work to make sure that the earner experience is as great as it is, but we're very, very optimistic about this fundamental change. Last thing I'll say about this is, this is one of those invisible or not so invisible benefits of the platform.
This is actually how delivery have been pricing their trips for some period of time. Delivery companies show upfront where you pick something up, they show an upfront fare. It's exactly like introducing upfront fare to Uber riders. And our being a multi-platform, multiproduct business, allows us to take learnings from one side of our business, apply it to the other.
And instead of kind of starting from scratch, we've already -- we're adolescents now turn -- now using all open knowledge from our delivery business and passing it on to the mobility business. So lots of advantages having a single marketplace team, a single technology team, thinking about the best of both worlds, and constantly applying learnings for one to the other. And then as far as UberX goes, UberX Share, we're super excited about the business. I think with Share, we're looking to resolve a fundamental issue that the older pool model had, which is the interests of the rider and the interests of Uber were misaligned, right, which is the rider would ask for a pool trip hoping not to be batched and Uber, obviously, would want that trip to be matched in order to achieve the economics that we expect.
With UberX Share, there's an upfront discount, and when you are matched with another rider, you get a higher discount on your trip. So all the time, interests are aligned in this kind of system and we're very, very encouraged by the early signal that we're seeing, and we're looking to launch UberX Share in about 15 markets in the next quarter, and we will continue to expand from there. So both upfront fare and UberX Share are areas that we're quite excited about and areas where there's a lot of innovation going in per piece.
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can, on the delivery business. You grew, as you talked about, earners at a very high rate, especially in the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape for earners in the delivery business and where you see yourself vis-a-vis competition from a scale standpoint? Especially in the markets that you think are the most important to you where it lines up the most with the mobility business.
And then on the expansion of categories, how important is it to get some of those categories right as stand-alone apps and stand-alone businesses versus them being broadly more folded into the Uber app and getting the platform experience more right than wrong if you look out over the next couple years, vertical versus platform? Thanks so much.
Sure. I think in the U.S. on the earners' side, and again, we don't necessarily look at earners now as couriers or drivers because increasingly, we want earners to earn however they want to on a particular day. They may want to stay in their little neighborhood and that accrues more to delivering food because typically, you stay within a certain radius, or they may want to make more money and right now, earnings for drivers, for example, who drive more than 20 hours on our platform, in the last quarter were $39 including tips.
So earnings are super, super high, which is great for earners. On the courier side, I wouldn't say that there's a huge amount of competition in that we've got plenty of couriers and from what we can tell, our competitors do as well. It's a very flexible way to earn, which our earners appreciate. So we have seen the number of active couriers globally, up 34% on a year-on-year basis.
And in the U.S. and Canada, up 79% year-on-year. So we're in very good shape there. And actually, a fair amount of the year-on-year increase intake rate, call it, true take rate that you're seeing in the delivery business is because we've been able to drive cost per transaction down as a result of higher efficiency in our marketplace because we have plenty of couriers.
And as we get more density in our marketplace, essentially the distances that we have to carry food and go pick up food, etc com reduced, and our algorithms in terms of routing and batching continue to optimize and get better and better and better. That is essentially upside as it relates to net revenue. And it really doesn't cost anything. It just cost engineering time to achieve, which is time that we have.
And then as far as the super app versus multi-app consumer experience, the way that we're doing it is on the consumer side, we're looking to get the best of both worlds. Think about it in the same way that Facebook has a family of apps. They've got Facebook and Instagram and what's happened, they're kind of loosely coupled. Same thing with Google; they got Google and Google Maps and Google Mail, again, they are coupled.
You have one identity, one payments, etc. We're looking to achieve the same thing multiple apps, whether it's Uber or Uber Eats or Cornershop, your identity is the same, Drizly, your sign-up is the same. We treat you the same way. Your customer experience is consistently excellent.
You've got the Uber One membership that flows across all of those apps to save you on delivery fees. And at the same time, within each app, we're constantly cross-promoting one platform to the other. On Rides, we're cross-promoting Eats. We're actually super excited.
We're starting to cross-promote Rides on our Eats app. We frankly weren't sure if it's going to work. We now see a signal that it's working. Actually, we're able to resurrect riders back into the reopening through the Uber Eats app, which is something that we're super excited about.
So all the apps talk to each other, cross-promote each other. We use machine learning algorithms to figure out what is the best promotion to put in front of the right person at the right occasion. And you can imagine, lunchtime the promo may be different than drinks time, for example. On the back end, as it relates to earners, we are a single super app and essentially, you sign up to earn on Uber, and more and more, we will offer you different opportunities to earn based on what we know about your profile, based on time of day, based on where you are and based on what the opportunities are and we think that's a very, very significant structural advantage over other players in our industry, none of which has a super app model.
Thanks for all the color.
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Great. Thank you. Just given the challenges at Lyft, they talked about on driver incentives. Can you talk about the mobility supply demand dynamics and how you're going to manage what hopes to be a pretty robust opening over the next six months? And then when you look at your prepared remarks, some interesting stuff on regulatory and new use cases.
I just want to see if you feel like you're kind of getting over the hump here on regulatory, if there's real progress there. And why you've kind of decided now to expand some use cases to car rentals and travel. Does that kind of signal that the core business is now kind of on a positive trajectory? Thanks.
Yes. Listen, Justin. Our need to increase the number of drivers on the platform is nothing new nor is it a surprise. We were on this last year.
If you remember, Q2 of last year, we were very early. We saw signal and we leaned in very aggressively initially with incentives into improving our driver supply. And then we followed up the investment in incentives with tons and tons of innovation in terms of products, in terms of improving the driver signup flow, in terms of welcoming drivers to the Uber family, and then giving them opportunities, delivery opportunities, or rise opportunities. We see the sooner an earner can earn on the platform, the higher our sign-up rate to that first trip and often, we can get earners earning on the platform faster with delivery than we can with mobility because of regulations or background checks, etc.
So we're able to engage that earner with money in their pockets really, really early. And at the same time, we've invested in experiences where instead of, for example, you're having to upload your documents into our systems, we will go connect to insurance companies, DMVs, etc. And as we build out those APIs, essentially, upload those documents automatically versus having you do the hard work, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't and sometimes we may get the document right or wrong. We have -- we talked about upfront destinations for earners as well.
So we have pivoted the company to being earner-centric, innovating for earners, thinking about the earner experience, treating earners as with respect and dignity, and building for them versus building just for the company. This has been an activity that we've been on for a year and we feel very, very well prepared for the future. We're constantly watching supply demand dynamics. We're constantly watching supply hours.
Earner retention is improving. Engagement on the platform is improving. So we feel as good about our driver supply in general, our earnings earner position as we ever have. That said, we know we have to improve.
We have to keep increasing the number of new drivers on the platform. We're focused on resurrecting a number of drivers as well, and we're focusing on increasing engagement on the platform because the earnings levels are so high. So there's a lot of work to do ahead of us, but this is a machine that's rolling. Like this, the earner team at all levels, at the operational level, at the technical level, at the engineering level with ML algorithm optimizing, for example, driver incentives, all of it is rolling, and we know all of it has to work well in order for us to hit our really aggressive targets in the balance of the year.
And then as far as the regulatory process and new use cases. I'd say the new use cases are us playing offense. We have seen the cross-platform initiatives throwing from one essential service to the other from Eats to Rides, from Eats to Groceries, etc. We know how to cross-promote use cases.
There's a huge amount of trust and frequency and comfort with our products. We have your identity. We understand where you are. We have your payment details, etc.
So our adding new use cases such as car rental or travel bookings or adding new supply areas like taxi, they're just natural growth areas for us. And because we've already acquired the customer, because we already have built trust with that customer, we're essentially able to continue to increase engagement with our customer. The more engaged our customers are, the more we retain those customers and we're able to monetize those MAPCs as a result. So it's kind of a win-win-win on that front.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.
Thanks. Two questions, please. There's been a lot of focus on retail marketing. So at least across the industry.
So could you just give us a little bit of an update on where you are in terms of putting together Advertising revenue? I know you laid out a goal at your Investor Day? Any update on that? And then secondly, on the MAPCs numbers, any way to think about what the -- what should happen to MAPC growth going into the next quarter? I think that was -- that sequential decline, I think, was a lot of omicron hit. So are you back to a point where it's reasonable to expect MAPCs to grow through the balance of the year?
Yes. I'll start the second one first, which is we're absolutely seeing MAPC growth continue to accelerate post omicron. So for example, while MAPC growth for the quarter was -- or MAPCs were $115 million, up 17% for the quarter, in March, they were up at $120 million, up 20% on a year-on-year basis. So we're seeing MAPC growth accelerate, and we expect to see that acceleration build into April and the balance of Q2.
We absolutely see the reopening as a very, very big MAPC driver, especially on the mobility side. So expect MAPC to continue to grow and, if anything, to accelerate into the second quarter. As far as our Advertising business goes, continued strength there. We essentially more than tripled the business on a year-on-year basis.
And we are very much on track to hit the targets that we laid out during Investor Day.
Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is now open.
Thanks. Two, if I can. Just first, can you talk about the U.K. mobility business and where that is on kind of the path back to profitability under the worker classification and VAT charges? Can the U.K., do you think, get back to prior levels of profitability? And where are we on that journey? And then the second one, in the script, you talked about now expecting to be free cash flow positive for the full year.
Any update on how you think about the potential for capital return given your cash position and kind of where the shares are trading? Anything you could share that would be great.
So, Lloyd, I'll do the second one first, and Dara will do the U.K. after. So as you know, we're still coming out of the pandemic. We were clear early on that we were going to focus on making sure we add ample liquidity.
I covered this on Investor Day to let you know that free cash flow largely trails EBITDA by about $1 billion a year. And so that's why we have the confidence to make the statement that we'll be free cash flow positive this year. We certainly recognize, given what's going on in the market right now, and we encourage all to get toward being free cash flow positive because we think it will be very important as we think about the cycle. As we think about capital return down in the future, we certainly are going to be open to it, right? So we recognize that we're not going to get -- we don't get paid for hoarding capital.
As you know, in the past, there may be some things we want to do, and we will certainly look at capital return as one of those levers. But again, I think it was important that as you think about the pragmatic walk that we've taken on capital and on liquidity importantly. And as you know, we've taken every opportunity to improve our debt in terms of the amount of both extending and reducing the debt. And so I think you'll expect -- you'll hear more about this as we go into next year, but I think it was important to get to this point where we could declare that we'll be free cash flow positive this year.
And then we understand about capital return. I think if you think of our equity stakes, while they were mark-to-market down, they're very good sources of liquidity. And many of those lockup restrictions expire, if you will, or come due during the course of this year. nd so depending on where markets trade as well, we'll have plenty of sources to return capital.
Yes. And I think as far as the U.K. goes, look, we made tremendous progress in the U.K. We moved to the worker model.
We're now compliant with merchant status and we've recently been granted a private hire vehicle operator license for 30 months, which is terrific. ur relationship with the city is second to none, and we're committed to Citycon's goal of electrifying our fleet by 2025 in London, a real leader in environmental impact and something that we're firmly behind. e absolutely believe that it is a condition for every operator's license to move to merchant. We have not seen some of our competitors do so, but the TfL has been very, very clear that they will enforce those rules.
So we just think a level playfield is just a matter of time. And the ones that are ignoring the law are either accruing liability, they're going to pay for it sooner rather than -- sooner or later, one way or the other. We can't tell you the timing, but it is going to happen. s it relates to our business on the ground, our CIPD position is very strong.
So we're very confident as it relates to our category position. And our business has returned to solid profitability. Now we see profitability in the U.K. healthy and improving into the balance of the year.
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Hey, guys. Just two kinds of big picture questions. First is on the delivery side. So on convenience and Grocery, I think there's a debate whether 3P delivery or these new dark store concepts are a better business model.
So how do you view that? I know most of your businesses started in 3P, but would it make sense to build out 1P grocery or convenience eventually? And then second question is on the taxi partnership. So I think you said you want every taxi on the planet on Uber by 2025. Can you just talk about how those partnerships might impact the unit economics in rides? Thanks a lot.
Operator, somebody needs to be muted.
My apologies about that. Please continue.
OK. We'll try again. So as far as 3P versus 1P. I think our goal is to provide a great experience as it relates to our eaters and our shoppers who want their groceries and they want it fast.
All of our data suggests that getting your groceries inside of an hour is a spectacular experience. I think there's lots of debates as to whether it's got to be 10 minutes or 15 minutes or half an hour. And if anything, we see a bunch of the 10- or 15-minute folks move to the half an hour area, which is more of where we are. We believe we can get a spectacular experience for our grocery shoppers through partnerships with our grocery partners.
This is what they do day in and day out. And for example, we have a partnership with Carrefour, which is a huge player in France, where they are adjusting their model. They're taking everything that they've learned in their grocery space, years of experience and essentially, they're reducing the number of goods that they have and reducing the delivery times to that 20, 30 minutes, which is a delightful experience. So we believe that we're able to get the -- essentially 100% of the experiential benefits of fast grocery through partnership and avoid the kind of capital investments that you have to make in terms of leases, opening up a bunch of stores all over cities, in addition, frankly, to the defocusing of the team.
What we build, we are building a software layer on top of the physical world. That's what we're good at. We're good at matching demand and supply in a real-time way. We do it more broadly and with audiences that are unrivaled around the globe.
And we think building a bunch of dark stores in a few cities doesn't make our network any better, and we certainly have that -- the best real-time network out there. So everything that we see right now, we're essentially partnering up on 1P and all the signals that we see as positive. We are in a very limited way, running some tests in a few countries, in Taiwan and Japan, just to make sure we understand the counterfactual because we want to be intellectually curious. At this point, we think the partnership way is a route to go.
If we ever have to switch, we have the audience. We've got millions of members. So we think it's much easier to go vertical if we ever need to. But right now, we don't see any signal that we should be going vertical especially as it relates to the defocusing of the team.
In terms of taxi, just this one for us is, we think, a no-brainer, which is we talked at the beginning of this call and a lot of folks have talked about how bringing driver supply on in the U.S. and globally is an incredibly important initiative. We have about 4.5 million total Uber earners all around the world. There are 4 million taxis globally, 4 million taxis versus 4.5 million total Uber earners that we have.
These taxis typically are underutilized relative to our earners. We think that the technology that serves these taxis can be better and we're helping partner with them as it relates to technology. We think that the days of you're going on a street and waving your arm to hail taxis, we think those days are over. Like we think any entity that is dependent just on street hail is like a retailer who pretends that the Internet never happened.
So this is the time and we're seeing taxi partners want the benefit of our technology. They want the benefit of our demand. They understand that we're all in it together, and this can be a benefit for us. It can be a benefit for taxi drivers.
It can be a benefit for fleet owners, etc. So this is a win-win-win, and it's a big opportunity, 4 million taxis on a global basis. And we are now kind of going country by country, city by city. We're obviously excited about the announcements in New York City and San Francisco, but I want to make sure that our investors and analysts understand we've been at this for a while, right? We've been signing up taxis in Spain and Japan and in Korea and we have built out an experience set as to how you build out the taxi product and how you optimize the experience for the rider as well.
This is another benefit of our being a global company. We're coming to the U.S. with the confidence and experience that we built in Spain, Japan and a bunch of other markets as it relates to taxis. So we think it's a huge opportunity, and the team is incredibly excited to get going on it.
Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Great. So first, Dara, given that you have a meaningful competitive advantage on the ride share side, would your driver supply position versus competitor, how do you think about the opportunities to gain share? I mean it feels like you can manage consumer prices at better levels versus competition. Can you talk about the opportunity to gain share? And then second on Eats, one of the fears investors have on this space is that every product category that's saw benefit from the pandemic is now seeing some form of accelerated reversal may be due to churn or retention issues. Food delivery has been very resilient.
Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of frequency and usage underlying the bookings growth? Thanks so much.
Yes. Absolutely. As far as gaining share versus our competition, I'll tell you, gaining share isn't a priority for us right now. It's happening naturally in some of the reopenings and it could be because of the mix shift.
For example, travel or the travel category is growing at very, very significant rates, and we tend to skew high on the travel category or the Uber for business category. So we are observing some share gain in the U.S. and frankly, in most countries around the world, we're observing these kinds of share gains and it may be that the kind of consumer that's an Uber consumer is higher end, travels a lot, travels for business, etc is coming to the platform pretty quickly. And obviously, we're a beneficiary of that.
Our focus is on profitable growth. And we're -- I think we're able to achieve profitable, call it, durable growth while gaining share versus our competitors because of the power of the platform. And so it's kind of naturally happening. It's not something that we have to lean into.
And we're a lot less focused on, let's say, our competitors or competitor share as we are the opportunity to grow the business durably to add on new segments such as taxi or hail-ables, two-wheelers, three-wheelers or lower-cost product, whether it's high-capacity vehicles, etc. That's really the focus and the share will take care of itself, although it has been taken care of itself, and we're quite constructive in terms of share gains. As far as the delivery reopening impact and frequency. Listen, when you look at our delivery business, MAPCs were up 4% year on year.
Basket sizes were up 3% year on year. Frequency was up 4% year on year. So all of the core metrics that drive the business are positive and because of our innovation, as it relates to bringing more earners onto the platform and then the density of the network driving cost per transaction down, we're able to improve the margins of the delivery business. So we're happy with the trends that we see, and we think that our frequency is going to also be assisted by our cross-platform usage and a higher penetration of Uber One members into our gross bookings base.
We are -- the penetration of Uber One members is still low, generally for us and low compared to some of our competitors. And we see higher frequency with Uber One members. So we think that's a natural tailwind that can maybe combat some of the headwinds that some folks are seeing in the reopening.
By the way, one note, I didn't answer, and I want to answer all questions. I didn't answer the question on taxi margins. So as it relates to taxi margins, First of all, margins differ by geography. So for example, in the U.S., the deals that we've done with the taxi companies should be at quite attractive margins that are consistent with the rest of our business.
In some markets, let's say, of Japan or some developing markets, our taxi margins are lower. But we've consistently seen we're able to start at lower margins and then increase margins over a period of time. So when we think about the growth of our mobility business and the 10% incremental EBITDA margins that we are looking to deliver, our core product, that's the Uber Eats, X or Reserve, or Black, those will tend to deliver higher than 10% incremental margins. We'll use some of those, the incremental above 10% to invest in products such as taxi, three-wheelers, two-wheelers, etc, in order to drive what I'll call durable growth, MAPC growth, etc.
And we're constantly balancing the two. And hopefully, you've seen as it relates to our execution over the past couple of quarters and years that we have our hands on all the different levers in order to deliver very, very healthy top-line growth and the kind of profitability that investors are especially looking for nowadays. All right. Next question.
Our next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Just a follow-up on the regulatory update here. Maybe, Dara, can you talk about maybe the ongoing conversation with the New York state, given your recent wins in Washington and also pretty strong ongoing support from drivers in Massachusetts? Did these victories kind of help you move the conversation along? And also what are the key friction you're looking to resolve?
James, thanks for the question. The most important factor that is helping these conversations move forward is that drivers want to be independent contractors. Drivers price flexibility above anything. That's the reason why they earn on our platform.
I think everybody knows in the U.S., if you want a job, you can have a job, if you want a full-time job. It's not a problem getting a job, but our opportunity -- flexible work opportunities and healthy work opportunities is unique. You can work for us, you can work for competitors, you can work when you want, you can work, where you want, etc. It's pretty powerful.
And I think that fortunately or unfortunately, in our Zoom world where white-collar workers now have a lot more flexibility, maybe they also appreciate the value of flexibility in a way that they couldn't appreciate previously. So as it relates to New York or any other state, the good news is regulators are more and more aware of what drivers want and drivers overwhelmingly want flexibility and they want other protections and benefits, whether it's minimum earnings or other benefits which may change state to state to state. So I don't want to comment on New York specifically. We're having promising discussions there, but you never know when kind of the regulatory winds move one way or the other.
But generally, I would say that the regulatory momentum is positive. You see that in Washington. In Massachusetts, we have a ballot initiative out there. We are very confident of our prospects in Massachusetts.
And essentially, we'd like to see a negotiated settlement in these cities. Certainly, we'll look to have a negotiated settlement in Massachusetts but we're confident if we have to go to the ballot. And hopefully, New York will get there, but we can't predict the time.
Let's take the last question, operator.
Our last question today comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Great. Thanks. Two questions. What were the mobility rides volumes in the first quarter versus pre-COVID levels? And what are the kind of the key use cases where there is headroom to close the gap, particularly as we look toward reopening in the second quarter and the back half of the year? And then just on grocery and other delivery, what was that as a percent of delivery gross bookings in the first quarter? And just discuss any progress that you saw in the quarter and as we round through the year? Thank you.
So our Rides business is actually fully recovered versus where we were in pre-pandemic levels. And in fact, even on a trip basis, we're more than 95% recovered globally. We still have some room in the U.S. We're still in the high 70s in terms of recovery there.
But we've really seen all use cases come back, including airport travel, pretty much in line with pre-pandemic levels. So we were seeing a very, very strong reopening on the mobility side.
As far as delivery goes, new verticals, ARRs were -- continue to be higher than $4 billion. And we're seeing very, very strong growth there. We're also integrating the new verticals experience in a native way on Uber Eats and we're seeing really, really promising early signal there. And when you look at as of March, less than 10% of the users who completed a delivery trip on Uber in the last month ordered new verticals.
So there's huge opportunity there. That number is up 400 basis points year on year but we think that the potential of essentially upselling new verticals opportunities to our Eats -- to our eaters is very, very young, and there's a ton of upside left there.
All right. Great. We can wrap up there.
All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call, and great work to the Uber team. Q1 was a super, super strong quarter. We're expecting more of that in Q2.
I think this is a quarter where we're starting to show separation against our competitors in terms of execution and that execution showing up in the financials in terms of a healthy growth profile that we expect to see for some period and also profit generation and free cash flow generation coming up this year that we're very, very excited about. So thanks, everyone, for joining, and we'll talk to you next quarter.

1,"If you’re part of the LGBTQ+ community, finding a certified financial advisor who is LGBTQ+-friendly can be both important and challenging.
How can you get the best financial advice from an industry that doesn’t seem to have a very diverse pool of people from which to choose? Money is personal. What works for another person may not work for you. But here’s the thing: financial planning should be available to everyone. You deserve the absolute best financial advice, and finding a financial advisor who caters to your specific financial needs as an LGBTQ+ person can make all the difference to your future financial stability.
The amount that transgender women earn for every dollar earned by an American worker.
Rae says that such statistics make finding an LGBTQ+-friendly financial advisor more crucial for anyone dealing with transgender issues. “The attacks on the transgender community pose a wider set of financial challenges. The ability to get gender-affirming care will definitely affect decisions on where someone chooses to live. Likewise, where you live can affect what insurance will or will not cover.” It makes having an advisor who knows all the ropes even more important.
LGBTQ+ people who do decide to have children generally face steep financial costs for things such as in vitro fertilization, surrogacy, and adoption procedures. DINKS or not, there is an increased need for money, which can be best amassed through the kind of smart financial planning you can get from an LGBTQ+ or LGBTQ+-friendly advisor.
You should do your homework and make sure that the planner is legitimate and has a good service record before you hire them. Using a financial advisor search engine can help you find reviews about the advisor and verify their credentials.
Ideally, a financial advisor will have experience working with LGBTQ+ clients and can provide you with examples of challenges and strategies that can benefit your overall finances. Notice the advisor’s body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice when answering these questions. If they acknowledge the importance of these questions, they may be a good fit in your selection of a financial advisor.
Consider the type of client whom the advisor typically serves. For instance, some might take clients from all over the country, while others limit their practice locally.
Many levels of qualifications exist for financial professionals. A “financial coach” doesn’t require any formal training or certifications. Some organizations issue easy-to-get credentials that sound more impressive than they are. Not all credentials are created equally.
A CFP designation requires successful completion of a rigorous examination, which generates trust and implies competence. A chartered financial analyst (CFA) also must complete in-depth studies and pass an exam. Both designations have ethics and experience requirements.1516 Look for these credentials when choosing a reputable advisor.
Being a member of the LGBTQ+ community confronts a person with many challenges caused by prejudice and discrimination that are not faced by non-LGBTQ+ people. Some of these challenges make it harder to accumulate wealth. A supportive financial advisor will have good advice on how to overcome them.
There are online sources that specialize in locating LGBTQ+ and LGBTQ+-friendly advisors, but you can also use other search engines for advisors and then interview a selection with a view to determining their support and understanding of LGBTQ+ issues. In addition, asking friends and family for referrals can also yield good results.
No. Anyone can call themselves a financial advisor or planner. However, there are certain certifications, such as certified financial planner (CFP) and chartered financial analyst (CFA), that require rigorous study and the passing of an exam. These certifications are good indicators of competence.
Members of the LGBTQ+ community face financial challenges all their own, which is why it is wise for them to seek an LGBTQ+ or LGBTQ+-friendly financial advisor to guide them. Ultimately, having a supportive advisor provides a welcome level of comfort. However, even if the advisor is in sync with LGBTQ+ issues, it’s still important to vet their credentials and work history thoroughly before you sign on as a client.

According to an analysis by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, gay men earn about 69 cents on the dollar to their straight peers and lesbian women earn about 89 cents on the dollar to their straight peers. And these wage and wealth gaps are larger for queer and trans people of color.
Nevertheless, financial counselors and planners can help LGBTQ+ people navigate the tough financial questions they’re facing.
Bair wants to hear from clients about what it was like growing up, how a client’s family talked about money, whom the client loves and whom they financially support. These details are especially important for LGBTQ+ people who may be estranged from or not recognized by their family of origin.
“If you don't have your financial and legal house in order, your family's desires can come in and make decisions that exclude the people that you love and leave behind” in the event of an emergency, illness or death, says CFP Cait Howerton.
Finding an advisor who is both culturally and financially competent can help you identify and execute your financial and life goals, be it paying down credit and student loan debt, or financing your transition.
It's a common misconception that you have to be rich to need a financial planner. In fact, financial counseling and planning can be a tool for supporting LGBTQ+ families and communities to realize their goals, protect them amid challenges to trans and queer personhood and family security, and (potentially) shrink wealth gaps.
While there are many more LGBTQ+ individuals than LGBTQ+ financial planners, financial counselors and planners allied with the community are immersing themselves in the cultures and demographics they seek to serve. They can help you start small with paying off debt, financing a medical procedure and investing for retirement.
Financial counselors help with everything from learning money management and creating financial goals to helping you access tax credits, public assistance agencies and manage debt. This is especially important given that members of the LGBTQ+ community are more likely to live in poverty, experience homelessness and face discrimination and violence, including from their families of origin.
Long term, a certified financial planner can assist in creating a comprehensive financial plan. CFPs hold rigorous financial certifications and are fiduciaries, meaning they are legally required to act in their clients' best interests.
To find a financial counselor or financial planner near you, you can start by searching your local chamber of commerce or the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce to see if there is a financial advisor near you.
However, if you’re not out yet, or not comfortable using a planner you might run into at the grocery store, online or remote financial planning can help connect you to a member of the LGBTQ+ community or an ally.
You can use the Find an Advisor tool on the XY Planning Network website to search by LGBTQIA. Or you can search Find a CFP Professional by specialties such as ""LGBTQIA Individuals/Couples.""
Finding a financial planner who understands specific financial needs and situations can greatly improve your financial outlook, according to Dasarte Yarnway, co-founder of the Onyx Network, a platform supporting underrepresented financial advisors.
“From a money perspective, alone you go fast, together you can go far,” Yarnway says of the partnership with a financial advisor.
Once you’ve found a financial counselor or planner, the following financial, health and legal tools can help ensure your wishes are carried out in the event of an emergency or death.
Advance directives designate someone to act on your behalf in medical decisions if you’re no longer able to communicate, such as during end-of-life care.
A power of attorney allows someone else to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so on matters ranging from health care and money management to placing trades on behalf of a company.
A will details issues such as guardianship of children, funeral arrangements and distribution of property.
A trust ensures your assets go to the intended people (with tax benefits).
These are especially important for LGBTQ+ individuals and families who are not legally married, says Atlanta-based CFP candidate Kiersten Peshek.
“If clients aren’t interested in getting married, which is perfectly acceptable in relationships, we need to think about estate planning: that they inherit the house, have the ability to make health care decisions and make sure the law and family members don’t get in the way,” Peshek says.
Legally formalizing your financial, health and other wishes is especially important for children of LGBTQ+ people who may not be biologically related to their parents.
A previous version of this story gave an incorrect location for Kiersten Peshek. Peshek is based in Atlanta, Georgia. This article has been corrected.",investopedia,nerdwallet
1,"If you are a good saver, you know the value of maxing out your 401(k) plan and making sure you get the employer match on your contributions. And if you're a really good saver, you may be aware of the benefits of front-loading your 401(k) contributions, adding as much as possible to your plan early in the year. Front-loading maximizes your money's time in the market, which should produce better returns for your 401(k) account in the long run.
But if you're not careful with your front-loaded contributions, you could actually be missing out on a portion of your employer match. That's ""free money"" you deserve as an employer benefit.
Let's say you make $80,000 a year in salary. If your employer matches 4% of your salary dollar for dollar, you would assume that you'll get an employer match on the first $3,200 you contribute to your 401(k). In other words, your account gets an extra $3,200 provided by the employer.
But it doesn't quite work out that way. Your employer, for instance, doesn't know if you'll work 12 full months for the year. It doesn't know whether you'll get a raise midyear or if you'll take lower compensation at some point in the year for extended time off. So, instead of matching your contribution based on your annual salary, employers usually base their matching contributions on your compensation for each pay period throughout the year.
So, that $80,000 annual salary breaks down to 24 pay periods of approximately $3,333 each, and your employer's 4% match ends up going toward the first $133 or so that you contribute in each pay period.
If you don't make a 401(k) contribution during a pay period, there's no match.
So, if you stop contributing part-way through the year, you could be missing out on a portion of your match. The reasons for stopping can vary. You might stop because you hit the annual contribution limit early (related to the front-loading of contributions strategy). Or you might stop because you thought you'd contributed enough to guarantee the company match and moved to funding an IRA, a Roth, or some other retirement accounts.
To account for this issue, some 401(k) plans have what's called a ""true-up"" provision. At the end of the year, the plan administrator will determine how much the company match should've been if you had contributed evenly throughout the year. The company will contribute those funds sometime at the beginning of the year following your contributions.
Check with your 401(k) plan administrator to see if your plan has a true-up provision. If it does, you don't have to worry as much about missing out on the employer match for contributions you've already made, but you should still consider making changes to how you contribute in the future. That's because if you're terminated or leave your job midyear, you won't get that true-up match at the start of the next year.
Let's go back to our example of the employee who gets paid $3,333 twice a month and gets a 4% employer match (equal to $133 per pay period). Normally, that person will need to contribute at least $133 (and 33 cents, to be closer to exact) to a 401(k) in each of the 24 pay periods during the year to get their full employer match. That creates a total employee contribution of $3,200 for the year (as well as the employer contribution of $3,200).
IRS rules in 2020 say that employees can make tax-deferred contributions of up to $19,500 toward their 401(k) plan. That leaves $16,300 in contributions still potentially available to add to the plan. Let's say you want to max out your contributions and your overall budget allows for that level of contribution. You also want to front-load those contributions to enhance your return and you have the discretionary income to contribute $1,000 per pay period (or an extra $867 above the minimum needed to get the match). It takes just a little more math to determine how many pay periods you should maintain elevated contributions to fully max out your 401(k) without missing out on the employer match throughout the year.
Here's the math. If you divide $16,300 by the additional $867 per pay period that you are contributing, you see it will take 18.8 pay periods to cover the added contributions. To make things easy, we will round down to 18. Through your first 18 pay periods, you will have contributed $18,000, leaving you with six pay periods left in the year and $1,500 still to contribute. That means contributing $250 per pay period through the rest of the year to max out your contribution.
Remember to increase your withholdings again at the start of the next year to repeat the process.
There are lots of different scenarios for how to manage this idea, depending on available income and contribution goals, but the overall idea is the same. By doing a little planning at the start of the year can help make sure you don't miss out on the company benefits you deserve while also maximizing your retirement strategy. Plan your contributions to max out your match while front-loading your investments and you'll improve your chances of growing your 401(k) balance as big as possible.","Welcome to NerdWallet’s Smart Money podcast, where we answer your real-world money questions.
This episode starts with a discussion about how to protect yourself from being tracked by websites and apps that want to use your personal data.
“I have a question about my 401(k) match. I have a goal to max out my 401(k) this year, so I was thinking of increasing my contribution amount early in the year, so that I could max it out early and then have larger paychecks towards the end of the year.
Many companies harvest your personal information to sell for profit, which makes protecting your privacy online a challenge. There is only so much you can do on your own, but those steps are worth taking. Consider disabling location on your devices, or for at least a few of your apps. Try services such as DuckDuckGo, Brave and Firefox, which build privacy into their platforms. Also contact your elected representatives and let them know if you’re concerned about privacy.
When it comes to saving for retirement, investing through a 401(k) is great, especially if you contribute enough to take full advantage of any match your employer offers. Maxing out your 401(k), or contributing the max amount allowed per year, is even better.
If you’re looking to take your 401(k) game to the next level, front-loading may be something to consider. Front-loading a 401(k) helps you get your dollars into the market at the start of the year — allowing you to take advantage of an extra 12 months of growth.
However, front-loading may come with an unexpected cost. You may miss out on some of your employer match, because some retirement plans only match contributions during each pay period that you contribute.
You’re less likely to miss out if your employer offers a true-up provision. In that case, your plan administrator determines how much the company match should have been if you had contributed evenly throughout the year and then contributes the difference the next year. This allows you to receive the same amount of money from your employer match that you would have if you had contributed throughout the year.
Front-loading may be worth considering if you can comfortably do so without becoming financially strapped; your employer offers a true-up provision; and you can remember to check in with your plan administrator. However, contributing at a more regular cadence is fine, too.
Contribute for a match: If you have a 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get your employer match.
Diversify your contributions: Consider having savings in retirement accounts with different tax treatments.
Ask about your specific plan: Front-loading may mean you miss out on your employer match, so talk to your plan administrator before making any decisions.

Sean Pyles: In this episode, Liz and I are talking about the smart way to max out your retirement accounts. But first, we're going to talk about her recent column, “Tweak Your Tech Settings to Protect Your Privacy,” which sounds encouraging, but Liz — from my understanding, you got pretty discouraged doing the research for this.
Liz Weston: Oh, I did. And so, so discouraged. I mean, I know something about privacy, and I know something about how much data is being collected. But once you really get into it, you see why all the privacy experts are such doom-and-gloomers.
Basically, all this data is being sucked up about you and kept in perfectly legal databases. And having all this data means that advertisers not only target you and have their ads follow you from site to site, but they can manipulate people and figure out how to get them to spend more. They're trying to maximize profits so one person will spend much more than someone else. People who are struggling financially are getting targeted by predatory lenders and other seedy companies.
And then if there's any kind of database breach, suddenly all these bad actors are buying up your information for a buck or two and using it to scam you, to impersonate you. It's really pretty awful.
Sean Pyles: Yeah. Well, a lot of companies are interested in taking your information to essentially manipulate you.
Sean Pyles: These companies know you better than you know yourself in some way because they're understanding how you're engaging with an app, the amount of time you're spending on it, the way you are navigating through it. And then they can use that information to try to sell you things or suck you further into their platform.
Liz Weston: Yes, and it's being used in politics on both sides of the aisle. We're really only starting to understand how this is working, but no matter what your politics, they're being used against you to manipulate you. So there's a whole lot of reasons to be worried and discouraged.
Sean Pyles: And a whole lot of reasons to maybe just put your phone down and go for a walk in nature every once in a while. That sounds kind of nice.
But now that we are pretty acquainted with the risks of having our information tracked, what can we do to limit this?
Liz Weston: Well, fortunately, there are some real and significant ways that you can get back a little bit of your privacy, and a lot of them have to do with location tracking.
A few years ago, there's this wonderful article that The New York Times did that basically took what was supposedly anonymous data and tracked down the individuals involved, like children being tracked to schools and then after-school activities. And there's a woman who was a nurse going to her hospital and then a doctor’s visit and other places. So that's all a little bit scary, and really it's none of anyone's business where you're going.
And it's fairly easy to turn off the location tracking. You don't have to turn it off for all your apps; some of them are not going to work, like Google Maps, if you turn that off. But a lot of them do.
And basically just try it out. I mean, see what breaks and what doesn't. If it does ""break"" — if it won't work without your location — it will ask you, and you can easily set it back up.
Look at everything that's tracking you and shut down access for the apps that really don't need it.
Sean Pyles: And sometimes you'll be really surprised by which apps, that have nothing to do with your location, do want to know where you are and when.
I have this bad habit of, whenever I have a flight, I'll download like three dozen games on my phone just to occupy me when I'm in the air. And, every so often, I'll go into that privacy part of my phone — location tracking part of my phone — and I will see that some of these games are following me around and, as you described, selling my information.
So that, for me, is always very alarming. And it makes me just want to delete all the games and the apps that I'm not actively using on my phone.
Liz Weston: Yeah, I think a lot of those games — that's their primary purpose is to suck up data about you.
If you have an iPhone, by the way, and you've updated to iOS 15, check out something called the “App Privacy Report.” Basically, turn it on and let it run, and you will be amazed at which apps are tracking you and the kind of data that they're picking up about you.
We need to be constantly checking our privacy settings to make sure that they haven't been turned back on.
And that was something else the privacy experts mentioned — is that for these apps and websites to keep shooting requests at you, it's really easy to click on something just to make that pop-up go away. And then you might have answered it correctly and protected your privacy 35 times. Once in your rush, you're going to accidentally give it permission, and then everything's turned back on. So you have to constantly be vigilant about these kind of things.
Sean Pyles: One thing that stood out to me in your column as well is the idea of personalized ads, and how it's sold to us as something that is beneficial. And, in fact, I think fewer personalized ads in front of us is a greater thing for our budgets. Because that means that we are not being as actively manipulated by the companies that know us, again, better than we know ourselves.
Liz Weston: Yeah, I don't think personalized ads is something I care about, so I try to turn it off wherever.
Also, if you have a Gmail account — any kind of Google account, YouTube, whatever it is — you also want to turn off Google's location tracking. And I give some instructions for how to do that, for exactly the reason that you're talking about.
If you see those ads following you around the internet, that means way too much information's being sucked up about you. So you want to turn off the location tracking and also wipe your search and your app history from your Google accounts.
And again, the settings are there. They're not that hard to find; you click through a few screens. But shutting that down is super important.
Sean Pyles: I'm also a big fan of ad-blocker extensions on my browsers because of exactly that. Well one, ads are annoying.
But two, I am a sucker for an ad in a moment of weakness, where I'm like, ""Oh, well, that actually does seem kind of nice. Maybe I will buy it, because it's being advertised to me on every website that I go to."" And I've fallen for it more than once.
So it's just a good reminder to set up some safeguards for yourself, so that you don't fall prey to these things.
Liz Weston: And speaking of safeguards, an additional one is to switch the browser that you're using. Switch to Firefox, to Brave, to DuckDuckGo. Those were not built to suck up information about you; they were actually built with privacy in mind.
Sean Pyles: I will say they are not all created equal, though. I've used a couple of these over the years, and some I found had really wonky search results. Others seemed pretty good, but every so often I'll run into a website that doesn't quite function as well as it would on a Safari or a Chrome, for example.
So I think that these are absolutely worth adopting, but maybe doing a little bit of research to see which one works best for you.
Liz Weston: Yeah, exactly. I've defaulted to DuckDuckGo. Every once in a while, though, I have to switch back to Google or Chrome to do something.
Try them out, see how they work for you. But again, these were built with privacy in mind, rather than getting all the data possible about you.
Sean Pyles: You also talk in your article about how there is only so much we as individual consumers can do. But one of the best actions we can take as individuals is actually to let our lawmakers know that we care about privacy.
Liz Weston: Yes, exactly. We are not in the European Union, which does have a right to privacy. And it's clearly something that is needed going forward, because there is very little that we can do to protect most of our privacy. What I've been talking about will protect a chunk of it, but not protect everything that needs to be protected.
So if you care about privacy at all — if you've been out there and seen some of the information that's being collected about you — I think you will want to reach out to your lawmakers and say, ""Hey, let's do something about this.""
Sean Pyles: Always great advice. Well, before we move on to this episode's money question segment, we have a callout for all of the parents that listen to Smart Money, and we know there are a lot of you. We are working on a new series about the cost of child care, and we want to know: How are you paying for childcare? Where does it fit in your budget?

Liz Weston: Great. Well, I think we can get on to the money question.
Listener: I have a question about my 401(k) match. I have a goal to max out my 401(k) this year, so I was thinking of increasing my contribution amount early in the year, so that I could max it out early and then have larger paychecks towards the end of the year.
My question is regarding the match. Since 401(k) contribution limits are based on what I contribute and not what my employer contributes, if I max everything out what I'm allowed to contribute and then I can no longer contribute from my paycheck, will I be missing out on the employer match for the second half of the year, if I max it out early? Let me know. Thanks.
Liz Weston: All right. To help us discuss this question, we're joined by investing Nerd, Alana Benson.
Sean Pyles: Alana, our listener is clearly excited about maxing out their 401(k). But for folks who may not know, Alana, can you talk a little bit about the basics of a 401(k)?
Alana Benson: Absolutely. So, 401(k)s are great. They are employer-sponsored retirement plans, and they usually come with a pretty sweet benefit, which is the employer match. That's just when your employer matches what you contribute.
So, if your plan offers a 4% match, that means that as long as you contribute 4% of your salary, your employer will also match that 4%. And for just easy math’s sake, if you make $100,000 a year, and your employer matches 4%, as long as you put in $4,000 (or 4%), your employer will also kick in $4,000. That means that you get $8,000 total but you only have to pay for half of that.
Sean Pyles: It's basically free money.
Alana Benson: It's free money. It's awesome.
Sean Pyles: You don't get that often. All right. And what exactly does maxing it out mean when it comes to your 401(k)?
Alana Benson: So 401(k)s have contribution limits set by the government, which means that you can only put in a certain amount each year. You can't just put in however much you want. The 2022 401(k) contribution limit is $20,500, and those 50 or older can contribute up to $27,000.
So if you're trying to max out your 401k, that just means you're contributing the maximum amount for that year. Your employer's contribution does not actually count towards that personal max for you.
Liz Weston: One thing I've heard from people is they get confused about vesting with a 401(k). When we're talking about company matches, sometimes you don't get access to all that money right away; it takes some time.
And the good news is that the money you put in, you always have access to. In other words, if you put in $5,000 and you leave that company, you get to take that $5,000 with you. How much of the company match you get to take might depend on their vesting rules.
Sean Pyles: OK, and that's typically determined based on how long you spend at the company.
Liz Weston: Yeah. Vesting just means you get a right to the money over time, so there you go.
The other thing we should always mention is that we're not investment or financial advisors and what we're talking about is for general informational purposes only.
Sean Pyles: Thank you for that disclaimer, Liz.
Sean Pyles: So our listener seems to have a pretty clever plan for maxing out their 401(k), by front-loading contributions early in the year, and then reducing their contributions once they hit that maximum contribution amount.
That inevitably means that their paychecks will be smaller at the beginning of the year and then larger at the end of the year. Can you do that, Alana?
Alana Benson: Yeah. So I'll caveat that by saying that whether or not you can front-load a 401(k) will depend on your particular employer. So some might allow it; others might not. But if you can front-load, it will allow your money to get into the market faster, which means it will have longer to grow, which is a good thing.
And our listener alluded to the one downside, which is that your paychecks will definitely feel the difference when you're front-loading, so definitely be sure to do the math first and figure out if you can actually afford to front-load.
Sean Pyles: This also sounds suspiciously similar to timing the market. Is that going on here at all?
Alana Benson: I wouldn't say this is timing it. You know, timing it is going to depend on looking at the market and saying, ""Oh, this is what's happening in the world today, so I bet right now it's a better time for me to put money in than a year from now.""
But if you get your money in a year ahead of time, you know, over 30 years — if that's how long you have until retirement — it probably won't make that big of a difference. But it is still getting your money in a year ahead of time, and so you get an extra year of growth. But I wouldn't categorize this as timing the market. It's more just taking advantage of that extra 12 months of growth.
Sean Pyles: That makes sense.
Liz Weston: So our listener is mainly worried about whether or not they'll miss out on that critical employer match, since they won't be contributing from their paycheck for the second half of the year. Is that a concern they should have?
Alana Benson: So this will really depend on each person's 401(k) plan, kind of like I mentioned. Some plans will only match contributions during each pay period that you contribute, so every time you get a paycheck. And in that case, you actually would be missing out on some of your matching dollars, which is something that we definitely want to avoid.
But some 401(k) plans have what's called a true-up provision. And this means that at the end of the year, the planned administrator will determine how much the company should have matched you, if you had contributed evenly throughout the year. And then the company will then just contribute the difference the next year.
So, really, it will just depend on your plan. Talk to your administrator and specifically ask about their policies on front-loading so that you don't miss out on your match.
Sean Pyles: OK. And, you know, I'm thinking that our listener’s plan could be a pretty savvy way to front-load their 401(k) contributions.
But I'm also beginning to see some potential trade-offs — one of which you just alluded to, which is the added administrative work of changing your contributions, making sure your employer will even allow you to do this. And all of that administrative overhead sounds like more work than I personally am willing to go through.
What do you guys think about any other trade-offs?
Alana Benson: Well, the added administrative work is definitely something, because we're human. We're not perfect, and so if you want to do this, it means you need to be in the driver's seat. You need to check in with your administrator. Maybe the next year you need to follow up if you don't see that true-up provision coming through, if you don't see that money coming back to your account.
So that means you'll just really have to be on the ball and take accountability for your own money. And for some people, that's second nature. But if that's something that you struggle with, it might not be worth it if you forget to let your administrator know to pay you the rest of your employer match.
Alana Benson: And it could also make managing a budget more difficult because your net pay will just change depending on how much is actually being contributed.
And then, obviously, the big one: If you do actually miss out on matching dollars — if your plan doesn't have this true-up provision — I mean, as we said, this is free money; you don't want to miss out on it.
Sean Pyles: And one thing that could be a potentially controversial take is that maxing out a 401(k) isn't actually the best use of someone's money. You might not be able to multitask and meet other financial goals.
If you're shoveling all of your money into a 401(k), you may not be able to build up a down payment on a house. And if all of your money is going into this one retirement account, that might prevent you from contributing to something like a Roth IRA that has a different tax structure that could help you in retirement.
Alana Benson: You just want to make sure that you have enough money to live your life. You know, if you're doing everything you can to maximize what you can do with your 401(k), that's one thing. But if it's creeping into the rest of your life and making it so that you don't have room in the budget for other things, that might be something to consider, too.
Liz Weston: Well, I'll make the argument from the other side. Especially if you're younger and you can do this, maximizing your retirement contributions early on gives you so much more flexibility later on. The earlier you get that money in, as Alana said, the more it can grow.
And it just gives you more freedom to take a sabbatical, stay home when you have kids, do all kinds of other things — maybe even retire early. So I get that you don't want to put all your money into retirement, but I like the idea of maximizing where you can.
Alana Benson: Yeah, it's all a balance.
Sean Pyles: Yeah. And I think there are ways to balance your 401(k) contributions with other retirement contributions to help you really max out what you're contributing, but doing it in a really savvy way. Some financial advisors will recommend that you contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match, and then moving other funds that you would contribute into a Roth IRA or something like an HSA.
Liz Weston: We constantly talk about this, but it's really important to have money in different tax buckets when you get to retirement, because that really helps you manage your tax bill.
If you put all your money into pre-tax vehicles like the 401(k), all of your withdrawals are going to be taxable, and there's also required minimum distributions that can mess you up and throw you into a higher tax bracket.
Anyway, the bottom line is: You do want money in different tax buckets if you possibly can, and that's why advisors suggest doing it this way.
Alana Benson: Yeah. The one caveat I'll make to that, too, is that obviously that's a different situation if you have a Roth 401(k) because then you are getting that tax advantage in the form of your 401(k) as well.
Liz Weston: Yeah, good point.
Sean Pyles: Another thing that folks might want to consider is contributing to an HSA. It's a health savings account that allows you to invest directly from the account and use that money also for health-related expenses.
HSAs offer a triple tax advantage, which means that the contributions are tax-deductible; growth is tax-free; and distributions are tax-free when used for a qualified medical expense.
Liz Weston: Right. And they're different from FSAs, which are also a way to save for medical expenses, in that you can roll the money over from year to year. This is what allows you to be able to invest.
Sean Pyles: Yeah, and for listeners who have not checked it out, we actually recorded an episode with Alana about exactly this subject, so check that out in our archives. Alana, do you have any other thoughts around maxing out retirement contributions?
Alana Benson: The most important thing is just contribute. It's maybe stressful to hear about people maxing out their accounts and you think, ""Oh, wow, I'm really far away from doing that.""
That doesn't matter; just contribute. And maybe if you don't have the means to contribute to get your employer match, just work up to that. There's nothing to feel bad about, and just remember that where you're at is OK and that saving for retirement at any rate is a good rate.
Sean Pyles: And the sooner, the better. I talk with some friends who are a little on the fence about this sometimes. And I try to convince them that the earlier you do it, the more time you have for these funds to grow, the more time you have to take advantage of compound interest.
And you will thank yourself later on. You'll have less to catch up on down the road.
Sean Pyles: Well, Alana, thank you so much for talking with us today.
Alana Benson: Thank you for having me.
Sean Pyles: Now let's get on to our takeaway tips. First up, contribute for a match. If you have a 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get your employer match.
Liz Weston: Next, diversify your contributions. Consider having savings in retirement accounts with different tax treatments.
Sean Pyles: Lastly, ask about your specific plan. Front-loading may mean you miss out on your employer match, so talk with your plan administrator before making any decisions.

1,"Zenefits has made waves since day one. It disrupted the HR software market right from its launch, showing small businesses that they could save a ton of time and money by automating manual processes.
Even better, Zenefits doesn’t take years to set up, require a huge amount of training, or mean massive upheaval for your business.
Despite a few blips along the way, Zenefits remains a market leader and continues to push boundaries, such as with its offering of free payroll for a year.
However, that doesn’t mean it’s perfect, and it may not be right for your business. This article looks at Zenefits’ competition and explains what other HR solutions have to offer.
No piece of software is perfect. Even a solution as strong as Zenefits has its weaknesses. Here we’ll explore the features and functionality you should look for in Zenefits’ main competitors.
HR is a data-driven business function. Trying to manually track HR metrics using pen and paper or a spreadsheet is time-consuming and error-prone.
That’s why you need to look for an HR solution that not only collects all of your data, but also centralizes it in one place, so you can glean insight into company and employee performance.
Look for competitors of Zenefits that have built-in reports you can run with the click of a button, plus the option to create your own custom reports for your specific business needs.
Right now you might need only basic HR functionality, but what about a year from now? You need HR software that can grow with your business. Look for an HR solution that has multiple pricing plans so you can upgrade (or downgrade) when your needs change.
Or, look for HR software that has add-ons or integrations that let you expand its functionality as you grow.
If you’re managing a small business, you don’t have weeks to get up and running. You can’t afford the downtime, and you can’t afford to pay for days of training to get employees up to speed with a new software product.
You need an intuitive, easy-to-use solution that doesn’t require formal training or constant reference to a manual.
Also, look for HR software that has a familiar look and feel to consumer solutions so it feels like you're using the latest technology rather than an outdated tool.
The HR software market is crowded with solutions. It can be difficult to wade through all of the options (and promises) to find the software that's right for your business. Here, we look at what Zenefits’ biggest competitors have to offer.
If you’re a startup, Zenefits might have features you won’t use -- at least until your business grows. And you don’t want to pay for features you don’t need.
Zoho People offers a free plan for up to five users that provides basic HR functionality, such as time and attendance, an employee database, document management, and reporting. This makes it an attractive solution for startups and small businesses on a limited budget.
As your business grows, you can move up to one of the four paid pricing plans, which start at $1/month, per user. This gives you the option to add extra functionality, such as onboarding and performance management, in line with your business’s needs.
If you’re looking for HR software that can grow with your business, ADP Workforce Now is a great option. Its modular approach means you pay only for the features you need, and you can add more functionality as your business grows.
This helps you identify areas where you're overspending -- such as overtime pay -- and take actions to address the issues, such as automating manual processes or improving the way you run your operations.
You can also view this data by location and benchmark your results against your competitors to see how you stack up.
ADP Workforce Now has some interesting employee management features, such as its integration with Slack and Microsoft Teams. Your employees can see their vacation balances and submit time-off requests directly from these productivity platforms rather than logging in to the ADP portal.
Some HR solutions, while packed with great features, lack user-friendly workflows and sport outdated designs. This becomes a bigger issue as digital natives enter the workforce and expect their work systems to be on par with the technology they use in their personal lives.
Namely’s modern user interface and dashboard borrows from social media apps such as Facebook. Its Newsfeed draws attention to company announcements, and the layout allows users to quickly access different HR functions from the left-hand menu.
Users can get up and running without needing to complete hours of training or pore over a user manual.
Namely is also a good all-around HR software. It offers a broad range of features, covering recruiting, onboarding, performance management, time and attendance, and benefits administration, all of which are easy to use and understand.
Bamboo HR is a straightforward, intuitive piece of software. Suitable for small businesses that don't have the resources to run a dedicated HR department, it provides hiring, workforce management, and reporting functionality.
You can also choose to add on functionality on a per-module basis, including performance management, time tracking, and employee satisfaction.
Bamboo HR has a well-organized and easy-to-use dashboard that clearly highlights important company information. It’s easy to find your way around and quickly complete common tasks such as managing job openings, accessing reports, and requesting time off.
It also provides a seven-day free trial, so you can try before you buy.
If you work at a startup or small business, you’ll often have to take on responsibilities that are far outside your wheelhouse. This includes recruiting.
If you don’t have the budget for a dedicated hiring manager, then the responsibility for sourcing and managing talent will land on the shoulders of whoever has time. That’s when you’ll realize the value of an applicant tracking system like Workable.
Workable’s intuitive and modern user interface makes it easy to create job ads, even if you’ve never done it before. It provides suggestions -- for example, in finding the right words to use -- that help you quickly create more effective ads.
Its functionality also helps you better promote your vacancies by targeting the right audience according to criteria such as location or whether it’s a remote job, while Workable’s artificial intelligence capabilities help you more quickly source top talent.
While all businesses want to spend the minimum amount of time managing their HR departments, some companies have complex human resources needs. That’s when a solution like Workday HCM comes into play.
Workday HCM has a vast array of features covering the entire human resources spectrum. This ranges from workforce management and planning and recruitment to performance management, compensation and benefits administration, and payroll.
Workday HCM also helps your HR professionals play a more strategic role in the way your business operates. It provides an overview and a detailed breakdown of the performance of both employees and the business as a whole.
Its comprehensive dashboard displays easy-to-digest visual representations of factors that influence the smooth running of any workforce. This includes the cost of your freelance workforce, your progress toward diversity targets, and your succession planning achievements.
Before ruling Zenefits in or out, you need to think about what you need now as well as what you’ll need in the next few years. Draw data from your staffing plan and organizational goals to help you decide what features are must-haves, which are nice-to-haves, and which you can live without.
Then head over to our HR software review pages where you can get more in-depth information on each solution, such as pricing, support, features, and ease of use.
Karen McCandless covers email marketing software for The Ascent, and specializes in business communications and tech.","You’ll make many decisions over the life of your business, one of which will likely be the type of small-business HR software you’re going to use. Zenefits is a popular platform, but there are great alternatives to Zenefits, too.
All of these different platforms excel in certain areas. Some are more tailored to people management, while others are better at payroll. Some have it all — though you might have to make other trade-offs along the way, such as within ease-of-use or price. Ultimately your best option will be the platform most suited to your unique business needs.
Zenefits is among the most popular platforms for small businesses to manage their HR, benefits, payroll and more. If you’ve spent any time with Zenefits reviews, then you know that the platform is well-liked — packed full of features as well as priced competitively.
Multiple pricing tiers for businesses of varying sizes (between $10 to $27 per employee per month, with a discount for buying yearly instead of monthly).
Add-on library for extra customization.
Good at automating onboarding and offboarding tasks, as well as regulatory and compliance tasks.
Offers both a benefits-management portal and a comprehensive payroll portal.
Among the strongest mobile apps available, with integration into tools including G Suite, Salesforce, Asana and more.
Easy-to-shop-for benefits on the platform.
Competitive pricing, but on the higher end of some Zenefits competitors.
May not be as intuitive to use for some.
Customer service can be hit or miss.
Another well-loved HR software provider is Gusto. If you’re looking for an intuitive experience that’s easy to use and well designed, then Gusto is right in your sweet spot.
Gusto’s strength is its payroll management (something that comes as an add-on in Zenefits) for both staff and contract employees. The platform seamlessly manages check payments, direct deposits and tax filings, and you can connect it to many of the most common business accounting software platforms to keep you organized. It also is well-designed for easy onboarding, with features including e-signing and ways to manage commuter benefits, retirement plans and more.
Like Zenefits, Gusto has tiered pricing. The first tier - Gusto Core - costs $40 per month, plus $6 per employee per month, and is more focused on these payroll tasks. To get the comprehensive HR-management platform from Gusto, you’ll need to opt into a higher tier. If you only handle contract employees, you can opt into Gusto’s newest option for $6 per employee with no base price.
Health-benefits administration isn’t available in every state with Gusto, so make sure that your state is among the ones it services if you’re going to use it as a benefits portal.
For those who want powerful payroll management with their HR software, Paychex Flex should be a consideration among the Zenefits competitors. Paychex is one of the stalwarts in the space, which means it has a strong track record of delivering a great product to many different companies.
Paychex Flex is a very scalable service with well-regarded customer service. You can use Paychex Flex to manage your payroll and do a few HR tasks, too, such as benefits administration. There’s also the option to expand the type of HR services that your business runs through the platform (though, of course, this will affect the cost). One drawback that some users have noted is that the platform isn’t as easy to use as some others, including Zenefits.
Paychex Flex also has a few different tiers of pricing, but you’ll need to reach out to the company to find out exactly what you’ll be paying, since it operates on a quote-based pricing model. All tiers include 24/7 support should you need it.
Another close Zenefits competitor for those who are looking for a strong people-focused platform is BambooHR. It’s an excellent platform for streamlining your HR operations, including onboarding and offboarding, vacation management, paperwork and more. A huge strength of BambooHR is its hiring focus: You can post jobs, track applicants and customize your hiring process directly through the platform.
BambooHR does not handle small-business payroll out of the box; instead, you’ll need to opt for an add-on that exports data to a third-party payroll system. So, if taking control of your payroll is your top priority, BambooHR won’t be for you.
Users love BambooHR due to the platform’s ease of use both on the back-end and employee-facing side. And, of course, it’s lauded for those great hiring tools. One of the downsides, however, is that it doesn’t offer upfront pricing like Zenefits; you’ll have to get a quote through BambooHR in order to find out what this software will cost you.
Kronos, which offers HR and benefits management to many major companies, offers a tier called Kronos Workforce Ready, specifically designed for small businesses — think of it as a selectively curated version of the larger platform.
Even though it might sound scaled back, this Zenefits competitor is still packed with features and customization options. In fact, the ability to incorporate add-ons, such as talent acquisition and performance management, makes this one of the most flexible platforms out there. That said, this customization can be a little confusing and overwhelming — so keep that in mind if you’re looking for a quick and easy platform versus something more powerful.
The mobile app here is very strong, too, and the company is well-recognized for staying on top of trends in the HR space.
Before diving in with Kronos Workforce Ready, you’ll need to reach out to the company directly to receive a quote on its pricing — it’s not as straightforward or transparent as Zenefits is. On the bright side, there is a free demo you can request through its website to help you get familiar with the platform before you commit.
Although GoCo isn’t necessarily the best-known platform among Zenefits competitors, it’s among our very favorite HR software for small businesses. It’s very easy to use and straightforward, and its features pack a big punch — especially for its competitive pricing. There’s also an ability to customize the way you use the platform, but it doesn’t make getting down to business confusing.
You can use GoCo for employee paperwork, time management and benefits administration. GoCo is unique with its network of benefits advisors who can help with the (inevitable) support you’ll need as you go through benefits admin. Keep in mind that you can’t do payroll entirely with GoCo, but it’ll sync with existing payroll software (there’s a small additional fee).
A big bonus is that there’s a free version that’s relatively robust, but look into the paid versions, too, since you’ll get more features and integrations that can really help save you time. There’s no free trial here, but you can ask for a demo — or you can sign up for the free version to test drive the software for yourself.
Not everyone has international needs, but if your business is among those working with employees around the globe, CezanneHR could be a good fit for you. This platform helps you through all of the varying international compliance regulations and laws, no matter where your employees are.
With CezanneHR, you’ll pick the platform modularly, meaning that you’ll choose what kind of functionality you use. For instance, you could opt into payroll management, performance management, recruitment and more.
As you might expect, this kind of functionality comes at a premium; although you’ll need to get a quote directly from CezanneHR to find out how much the platform will run you, you should be prepared to pay on the higher end compared to Zenefits. On the bright side, CezanneHR can handle up to 5,000 employees, so if you’re growth-focused, this scalability is a great thing to keep in mind.
If Zoho sounds familiar, it probably is — Zoho People is by the same people who are behind the popular accounting software Zoho Books.
This platform particularly excels in people management for entrepreneurs looking to manage their workforce: It does a great job keeping track of employee records and paperwork, managing attendance, scheduling shifts and tracking time. You’ll find this particularly helpful if you work with a lot of contractors. Zoho People is employee-centric, instead of being tailored toward an HR manager, so there’s a great employee self-service portal that’ll enable your staff to enter their information on their own.
This Zenefits competitor isn’t quite right for those who are looking to administer benefits to staff members as opposed to tracking individual employees’ information.
You can try out Zoho People with a limited free trial. And, if you’re interested from there, it’s one of the less expensive people management platforms for small businesses. Zoho People is free for up to five users and beyond that, you’ll pay between $9 and $29 per month (if you choose to pay annually you’ll receive two months free).
Remember that, ultimately, the best fit for your small-business HR platform is very personal and completely dependent on what your business needs — not how well it’s working out for someone else. That means that even if a platform sounds like it could be great, you won’t know unless you spend some time in the weeds getting to know the features and determining whether it’s a match for your day-to-day operations.
With that in mind, there are a few ways to help you narrow down your search for your perfect HR management platform.
What’s more important — do you need a robust way to handle lots of employee benefits and track PTO, or are you really hoping for more of a payroll platform? Are you looking into one of these HR platforms because you need to cut down on the amount of time you’re spending on these tasks, or are you just looking to get more organized?
Questions like these are very important for you to ask yourself since some platforms do a better job of addressing certain issues than others. If you’re not sure of the questions you should be asking, take a step back and then walk through your day-to-day with HR, noting both what works and what doesn’t.
Some platforms have a better user experience for employees and enable them to manage more from their employee dashboards. Your business might not be at a place where you need anything like that yet, but keep in mind that there’s a workforce-facing side to most of these platforms, too.
As you’ve probably noticed, many HR platforms are priced per seat — meaning per employee. If you go through a growth period, you might all of a sudden find that you’re paying more for your platform than you expected — or, worse, can even afford. Keep in mind how you’re expecting your company to scale in the coming months or years, which can help you consider not only the features that you need from a platform, but also how much you’re going to end up spending.
One of the best ways to know which of the Zenefits competitors is right for you is to take advantage of any free trials or demos. So many small-business payroll platforms offer free trials for around a month, which means you can really get into the program and give it a try yourself.",Fool,nerdwallet
1,"Despite the country's best efforts, U.S. oil production had been on a steady decline for decades. That was until producers found the keys to unlocking the country's vast shale resources, which quickly reversed those declines. In fact, the resurgence of U.S. oil output was so dramatic that it caused oil prices to crash, which unfortunately had recently caused U.S. oil production to start falling again.
U.S. companies that produce and distribute oil and gas.
U.S. companies engaged in the exploration, production, and distribution of oil and gas.
U.S. oil and gas exploration and production.
Data source: iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF, iShares U.S. Energy ETF, and SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production ETF.
The iShares U.S. Energy ETF is a lower risk way to invest in shale because the bulk of its investments are in top-tier U.S. oil companies like ExxonMobil (XOM 0.75%) and Chevron (CVX 0.01%), which are the fund's largest holdings at 23.4% and 13.9%, respectively. While they are among the biggest of big oil, both have large, growing shale businesses. Exxon, for example, recently spent $5.6 billion to double its Permian Basin position, where it was already dominating along with Chevron. In addition, the fund also holds a significant stake in shale-focused driller EOG Resources (EOG 0.26%), oilfield service giants Schlumberger (SLB -0.39%) and Halliburton (HAL -0.85%), pipeline giant Kinder Morgan (KMI -0.43%), and refiner Phillips 66 (PSX 1.23%).
Overall, the fund holds 71 investments. However, its top ten holdings account for 65.7% of the total. Because of the fund's concentrated investments in top-tier energy companies, it has lower risk than other ETFs, which also means that it has less direct upside to resurgent shale.
The iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF is a much more focused bet on the U.S. oil and gas industry. While it does hold several refiners among its top ten, the vast majority of its holdings are E&P companies focused on shale, including ConocoPhillips (COP 0.40%), which is its largest holding at 10.5%. While ConocoPhillips is a global oil company with a balanced portfolio, about a third of its production and the bulk of its future growth is from unconventional shale assets such as the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Permian Basin.
In addition to Conoco, four other shale-focused producers are in the top-ten: EOG Resources, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD 0.93%), Devon Energy (DVN 0.44%), and Concho Resources (CXO). All four companies hold prime positions in the Permian Basin, which they anticipate will fuel double-digit oil production growth over the next several years at current oil prices.
While this fund holds 53 companies, its focus is also at the top. At the moment, its top ten holdings account for nearly 60% of the total. That said, because large shale producers make up the bulk of that top-ten, this fund represents a directional bet on the best-of-breed shale stocks.
The SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production ETF does things a bit differently. Instead of weighting its holdings by the market size of the company, the fund equal weights its holdings. Because of that, it holds roughly the same sized stake in big oil behemoth Chevron as it does in Permian Basin-focused Pioneer Natural Resources and other smaller drillers. As a result, the fund offers investors much more upside potential, especially as smaller shale drillers ramp up output.
That greater upside has been evident over the past year where the fund is up 55% thanks to a significant rally in shale stocks. That's nearly double the return of both the iShares U.S. Energy ETF and the iShares U.S. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production ETF.
However, that higher reward also comes with increased risk because by putting all 63 companies on an equal footing, the fund opens investors up to the likelihood of higher volatility from weaker producers. That has certainly been the case over the past three years, where the fund has returned a negative 17.3% due to the impact of the oil market downturn. Contrast this with a negative 4% return by the iShares U.S. Energy ETF and a negative 6% return by the iShares U.S. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production ETF.
While all three of these energy ETFs should benefit from resurgent shale production, they'll do so to varying degrees due to their different risk profiles. The iShares U.S. Energy ETF, for example, comes with the least direct shale exposure and lowest risk due to its concentration on big oil stocks. Meanwhile, SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production ETF is a higher risk option because it has roughly the same exposure to more than 60 U.S. oil stocks.

When these companies are wrapped in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investors can choose between strategies involving indirect participation, hedged portfolios and direct exposure with high levels of volatility. Three ETFs particularly stand out for using these strategies, should the shale industry rebound, as of March 10, 2016.
Should a recovery in the U.S. shale oil industry occur, the companies that compose the holdings of the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF (NYSE ARCA: XES) should benefit as well. Unlike conventional drilling with rigs that can pump relatively consistent levels of oil for 20 years or more, a typical shale oil well loses about 70% of production in the first year. By the third year, production is reduced to a trickle. The need to replace lost production puts shale oil companies in a constant state of drilling new wells, but with oil's price in the mid-$30s and the break-even price on shale oil being around $50 per barrel, oil producers have slowed the development of new wells.
However, an increase in oil prices to the point where shale oil can be extracted and produced at a profit would likely start a new round of rig construction as companies play catch-up to replace lost production and rebuild their balance sheets. The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF could also benefit from lower shale oil production costs due to improvements in technology. On average, production costs for shale oil dropped from $100 in 2006 to $50 per barrel by the end of 2015 as advances in fracking technology resulted in lower up-front costs and more output per well. The continuation of this trend would lower the break-even point for production costs, resulting in profitable drilling at oil prices lower than $50 per barrel.
The ETF that provides the closest thing to a pure play on shale oil companies is the Invesco S&P SmallCap Energy ETF (NASDAQ: PSCE), which focuses on exploration, production, services and equipment companies in the Standard & Poor’s Small-Cap 600 Index. The fund's largest holding at a 13.8% allocation is PDC Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: PDCE), which has shale oil operations in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and the Utica Field in Ohio. The second-largest position in the fund is Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. (NASDAQ: CRZO) at a 10.01% allocation, which focuses primarily on shale oil operations in Texas, Ohio, Colorado and Pennsylvania.
The portfolio’s exposure to small-cap energy companies in general, as well as shale oil explorers and producers specifically, results in a high-volatility ETF that is not for the faint of heart. For example, the fund's beta is 1.7, meaning it is 70% more volatile than the general market. However, this fund is worthy of consideration for risk-tolerant investors seeking a bet on a U.S. shale industry rebound.
As a market-weighted fund, the Market Vectors Unconventional Oil & Gas ETF (NYSE ARCA: FRAK) concentrates 58.48% of its top 10 holdings in large-cap companies that get a small percentage of revenues from shale oil, and distribute the balance of its holdings over smaller exploration and production companies. For example, the fund’s largest holding is Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY), which operates in three distinct segments: oil and gas, chemicals, and midstream and marketing. The company announced in October 2015 that it was reducing its exposure to shale oil by selling its operations in the Bakken field, located in North Dakota. These operations represented Occidental's largest stake in shale oil.
As a result of its concentrated holdings of large-cap integrated oil positions mixed with small-caps in the oil and gas sector, the ETF offers hedged exposure to shale oil companies, with relatively lower volatility than a portfolio composed entirely of small-cap explorers and producers. For example, its return over 2015 was -34.01%, versus the Invesco S&P SmallCap Energy ETF’s loss of 48.3% during the same period. The performance relationship of these funds is similar on the upside, as the one-month return for the Market Vectors Unconventional Oil & Gas ETF was 17.48%, while the Invesco S&P SmallCap Energy ETF gained 24.41% over the same period.
These ETFs provide investors with three strategies to bet on a rebound for the U.S. shale industry. As an indirect play, the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF will benefit as producers expand their drilling operations. The Market Vectors Unconventional Oil & Gas ETF offers hedged exposure with relatively less volatility. For risk-tolerant investors, the direct and high volatility exposure provided by the Invesco S&P SmallCap Energy ETF will likely deliver the biggest price swings out of these three ETFs, both on the upside and the downside.",Fool,investopedia
1,"Thank you for standing by, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2022 financial results conference call. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that this conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Alexia Quadrani, senior vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead.
Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website.
Joining me for today's call are Bob Chapek, Disney's chief executive officer, and Christine McCarthy, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Walt Disney wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, Disney's employees and cast members continued to execute against our strategic priorities of storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus, and I could not be more proud of what they've achieved. Our strong results this quarter, including fantastic performance at our domestic parks and continued growth at our streaming services along with the creative achievements of our content teams, once again proved that we are in a league of our own. We have entertainment's most iconic brands and the world's favorite franchises, a high-quality creative pipeline that will continue to drive engagement and consumption and an unrivaled synergy machine with touch points that reach audiences across distribution channels, geographies and demographics, all of which come together to create a deep, emotional connection with audiences across generations.
I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter that illustrate these strengths, and then Christine will go through the details of our results. As I said, our domestic parks were a standout. They continue to fire on all cylinders, powered by strong demand coupled with customized and personalized guest experience enhancements that grew per capita spending by more than 40% versus 2019. Response to next-generation storytelling like Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser has been phenomenal.
In fact, guest ratings for this immersive experience, which opened March 1, are incredibly high and in line with our best-in-class offerings. Demand is strong, and we expect 100% utilization through the end of Q3. Looking ahead, we could not be more excited to officially welcome riders on Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at Epcot on May 27. One of the longest indoor rollercoasters in the world, the attraction puts guests in the middle of an exciting adventure as they're called on to help the Guardians out of a jam.
With our first-ever reverse launch and rotating cars that turn riders 360 degrees, guests won't miss a second of the story during our most immersive coaster experience yet. At Disneyland Paris, we are thrilled to take the next step in our ambitious expansion plan: the opening of Avengers Campus this summer as part of the resort's 30th anniversary celebration. As Europe recovers from the pandemic, we've seen strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris and look forward to its continued recovery. Another standout this quarter were our streaming services.
We ended Q2 with more than 205 million total subscriptions after adding 9.2 million in the quarter. That includes 7.9 million Disney+ subscribers, keeping us on track to reach 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by fiscal '24. The growth of the platform since its launch reinforces its unique nature. Quite simply, we believe Disney+ is one of a kind, a service based on exceptional branded content with wide appeal across all four quadrants.
It's certainly popular with families, but as a reminder, almost half of Disney+ subscribers are adults without kids. In recognition of Disney+'s unique ability to attract viewers from a range of demographic groups, we are selectively enhancing Disney+ with general entertainment titles designed to drive sign-ups among specific audiences and deepen engagement among those cohorts. A benefit of our incredible creative engines and decades of general entertainment excellence is that we can reach these demographics not only through the creation of original titles but also by shifting resources from across our content ecosystem, especially as consumer behavior continues to evolve. Our strategy is not just to fill our distribution pipelines but to be thoughtful with each asset to best position it among our various distribution options.
For instance, Dancing with the Stars is a beloved show that has entertained viewers for more than 30 seasons on ABC and is a wonderful example of content that brings the whole family together. We recently announced Disney+ will be the series' new home starting this fall. Beyond targeting specific demos, we are equally enthusiastic about our growth potential in international markets. We currently have over 500 local original titles in various stages of development and production.
180 of those titles are slated to premiere this fiscal year, increasing to over 300 international originals per year in steady state. We believe these premium local originals, along with branded content with broad international appeal, will attract new subscribers and drive engagement. One example in production is Nautilus from our EMEA team. Based on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Nautilus is the origin story of the iconic submarine from the perspective of its mysterious commander, Captain Nemo.
This is just one example of how our global network of creative hubs can develop and produce original content with worldwide appeal. And by the end of we plan to roll out Disney+ to 53 new markets across Europe, Africa and West Asia, starting with South Africa next week. Before leaving Disney+, I want to mention our recently announced plans to introduce an ad-supported subscription offering in the US by the end of the calendar year and internationally in 2023. Expanding Disney+ access through multiple price points is a win for consumers and advertisers.
Of course, all of our success is rooted in great content. Our general entertainment team continued its string of phenomenal series with Hulu's Pam & Tommy and The Dropout. And while not in the quarter, we could not be happier with the performance of The Kardashians, more great general entertainment content is ahead, like the second season of Only Murders in the Building on Hulu and the record-breaking 19th season of ABC's Grey's Anatomy. This quarter, our studios earned six Academy awards, including Best Animated Feature for Walt Disney Animation Studios, Encanto, and Best Documentary Feature for Onyx Collective and Searchlight Pictures Summer of Soul.
Pixar Animation Studios' Turning Red premiered on March 11 on Disney+ and became the fastest title to reach 200 million hours viewed on the platform. The Disney+ original series Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett drew positive reaction from audiences, and Marvel's Moon Knight continue the studio's impressive track record. Looking ahead, our studios will continue to deliver high-quality content at scale with an exciting array of series and films coming to all of our distribution channels. In fact, our slate for the remainder of this year is incredibly strong with titles like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ms.
Marvel, Lightyear, Thor: Love and Thunder, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and the long-anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water. Finally, I must mention the phenomenal success of Marvel's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which opened to roughly $450 million worldwide this past weekend. Domestically, it was the second-highest opening of the pandemic era and the 11th highest opening of all time. Our strategy of distribution flexibility has worked well for us, and these fantastic results are another sign of our ability to succeed no matter of the platform.
That success extends to sports. ESPN viewership was notably strong for the quarter across both live events and studio programming with ratings up double digits, and we remain encouraged by how fans are engaging with sports content coming out of the pandemic. Opening weekend of the NBA Playoffs was the most viewed in the past decade, and the ratings have been fantastic with over 4.3 million average viewers through 20 games on ABC and ESPN. Our groundbreaking NHL deal is unique in its exposure across ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, culminating with the Stanley Cup Playoffs, which began on May 2.
In fact, the combination of the NHL and NBA Playoffs going on simultaneously kicks off an exciting stretch of championship programming that also includes Wimbledon, the NCAA Women's and Men's College World Series, UFC, Boxing and more. Coming off the success of Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli, we recently debuted our new season-long MLB alternative broadcast, KayRod Cast with Michael Kay and Alex Rodriguez. And we began the inaugural season of PGA TOUR Live on ESPN+, featuring over 4,000 hours of live golf coverage from 35 tournaments. Before I hand it over to Christine, I want to say a few words about our unique synergy machine or franchise flywheel, if you prefer.
What sets Disney apart is our ability to reach people with our uniquely engaging content across an array of touch points to make our portfolio of businesses and brands a bigger part of their lives. This enables us to not only create new franchises like Encanto, but to also build on existing IP across our lines of business. One example of this is our Toy Story franchise, which was created almost three decades ago with the release of the first film in 1995 and which is now brought to life across distribution platforms, geographies, businesses and time. In our parks, we've built a portfolio of four immersive Toy Story lands with more than 20 attractions and live character interactions available around the world, as well as two themed hotels.
The franchise is the cornerstone of Disney+ with all four feature-length films, as well as the original short series, Forky Asks a Question, exclusively available on the service. And nearly 30 years after the film debuted, Toy Story is still a key consumer products franchise, generating over $1 billion in annual retail sales. And in just a few weeks, Pixar's Lightyear will tell the origin story of everyone's favorite space ranger when it hits theaters on June 17. Of course, Toy Story is just one of our many franchises, but it illustrates our unparalleled ability to bring stories to life in more ways for more people in more places.
In fact, our franchise library and capabilities will continue to set us apart even further as we bring our IP to life through next-generation storytelling that is more integrated and connected across consumer touch points. As we look to our second century, that's our mission: to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger, more connected and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine.
Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter were $1.08, an increase of $0.29 versus the prior year quarter. We continue to be pleased with our financial results with total segment operating income increasing by 50% versus the prior year quarter and by over 80% year-to-date. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment continued to show strong signs of growth and recovery as operating income increased by nearly $2.2 billion year-over-year to approximately $1.8 billion.
Growth was primarily driven by our domestic parks, which were open for the entire quarter. In the prior year, Walt Disney World was open, but Disneyland was closed for the entire quarter. We continue to be pleased with the overall demand and attendance trends at our domestic parks. In fact, there were many days in the quarter where we saw demand exceed 2019 levels.
However, we are continuing to control attendance through our reservation system with an eye on delivering a quality guest experience. As Bob mentioned earlier, per capita guest spending at our domestic parks increased by over 40% versus Q2 of fiscal 2019 and by 20% versus Q2 of fiscal 2021 with increases across the board on admissions, food and beverage and merchandise. Looking ahead to the third quarter. Our forward-looking demand pipeline at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland remains robust.
And while attendance from international visitation is still in the early days of recovery, we are beginning to see some improvements. We are also thrilled that as of the end of March, all of our domestic resorts are now open, a major milestone as we continue to move through the impacts of the pandemic. At our international parks, operating results improved versus the prior year due to growth at Disneyland Paris, which was open in Q2 and closed during the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by lower results at Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disney, both of which were impacted by COVID-related closures in the quarter.
Consumer Products operating income increased in the quarter, reflecting higher sales of merchandise based on several of our iconic franchises, including Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man, Star Wars and Disney Princess. Moving on to the Media & Entertainment Distribution segment. Second quarter operating income decreased by approximately $900 million versus the prior year as revenue growth of about $1.2 billion, primarily driven by direct-to-consumer was more than offset by higher expenses, including programming and production expenses at linear networks and direct-to-consumer, which came roughly in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. At our linear networks business, operating income in the quarter was $2.8 billion or roughly flat versus the prior year as modest growth at our domestic channels was offset by a decline at our international channels.
Domestically, higher operating income at broadcasting was partially offset by lower results at cable. Broadcasting results benefited year-over-year from affiliate revenue growth in addition to higher advertising revenue due to the timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in Q2 this year versus Q3 last year. These impacts were partially offset by higher programming and production costs also driven by the timing of the Academy Awards. At cable, lower operating income versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase in programming and production costs.
The largest component of the increased cost was driven by four additional NFL games versus the prior year, consisting of three regular season games, as well as the return of the Pro Bowl. These impacts were partially offset by growth in cable advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at ESPN increased by over 30% in the quarter, and third quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up significantly benefiting from a return to a pre-COVID NBA schedule that is driving increased viewership and pricing. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 5% in the quarter.
This was primarily driven by seven points of growth from higher rates, partially offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating income at our international channels decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower affiliate revenue and an increase in programming and production costs, partially offset by advertising revenue growth. At direct-to-consumer, operating losses widened to almost $900 million due to higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ and lower operating income at Hulu. The higher losses at our DTC services were largely driven by higher programming and production expenses, in line with what we noted in our guidance last quarter.
At Disney+, programming and production costs grew along with marketing and technology costs to support our growth around the world, partially offset by higher subscription revenue. We ended the quarter with nearly 138 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting close to 8 million net additions from Q1. A little over half of those net adds were from Disney+ Hotstar, which benefited from the start of the new IPL season toward the end of the second quarter. Internationally, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added over 2 million paid subscribers versus the first quarter with Latin America being the strongest contributor, driven by growth of the Combo+ offering.
Domestically, net adds of approximately 1.5 million reflect in part the success of tentpole content releases, including Turning Red and Moon Knight, as well as the strength of our bundled and multiproduct offerings. ESPN+ ended Q2 with 22.3 million paid subscribers, a net increase of about 1 million versus Q1. Operating results decreased compared to the prior year due to higher sports programming costs and lower pay-per-view income, partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, which ended the second quarter with 45.6 million paid subscribers, higher subscription and advertising revenues versus the prior year were more than offset by higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs.
Moving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased by approximately $300 million versus the prior year, driven by lower TV and SVOD results, which we discussed in our guidance last quarter, in addition to a decrease in home entertainment results. As a reminder, these impacts are deliberately aligned with our strategic decision to utilize our content on our own direct-to-consumer services. Before I touch on a few things that we'd like you to keep in mind for the back half of the fiscal year, I'll quickly note two other relevant items for the second quarter.
We recognized a revenue reversal of $1 billion related to the early termination of content licensing agreements with a customer in order to make that content available on our own direct-to-consumer services. Because substantially all of the consideration we received was recognized as revenue at the time that content was originally made available in previous years, we've recorded amounts to terminate the agreement net of remaining amounts of deferred revenue as a revenue reversal. Finally, a note on the impact of some tax-related items on our Q2 EPS. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items of $1.08, includes an adverse impact of approximately $0.11 due to the impact of higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of a recent change in US tax regulations.
It's worth mentioning that while our annual effective tax rate has generally been correlated with the US statutory rate, there are many complex puts and takes in any given period, which can lead to these variances quarter-to-quarter. And we currently expect the full year tax rate could remain somewhat elevated above the US statutory rate. Now, as it relates to the third quarter and the second half of fiscal 2022. At DPEP, closures at our Asia theme parks could adversely impact operating income in the third quarter by up to approximately $350 million versus the prior year.
As a reminder, Hong Kong Disneyland was closed for the first three weeks of the quarter, Shanghai Disney has been closed quarter-to-date, and we do not yet have visibility to a reopening date. As we continue to strategically prioritize leveraging our content for our own services, we expect content sales, licensing and other operating results to decrease in the third quarter by approximately $150 million to $200 million versus the prior year. The expected decrease is primarily driven by declines in content licensing along with a continued decline in home entertainment results. direct-to-consumer programming and production costs in Q3 are expected to increase by more than $900 million year-over-year, reflecting higher original content expense at Disney+ and Hulu, increased sports rights costs and higher programming fees at Hulu Live.
At Disney+, while we still expect higher net adds in the second half of the year versus the first half, it's worth mentioning that we did have a stronger-than-expected first half of the year. Additionally, note that some of the Eastern European markets we're launching in toward the end of Q3, including Poland, are in regions being impacted by geopolitical factors. As it relates to content spend, we previously stated that we expect fiscal year 2022 cash content spend to total as much as $33 billion. We've adjusted that amount to as much as $32 billion to reflect a slightly slower cadence of spending than anticipated during the first half of the year.
Note that we are still expecting a strong content slate in the back half of the year. And as Bob mentioned, we are confident in our long-term subscriber guidance of 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subs by fiscal 2024. We also still expect that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.
Thank you, Christine. We are happy to be back here in person for this call, but to make it easier, I will help direct the questions. [Operator instructions] And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.
Your first question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Yes. Thanks for taking the question. And Bob touched on pricing to some degree during his comments. So I thought we could come back to that.
One of the questions we've been getting is, how do you think about the right cadence for revisiting pricing on Disney+ really when you can take price higher? It just seems like there's a lot of factors that would go into that, including the fact you'll be launching a new ad-supported tier. You're putting a lot more content onto the service. You've seen some increased competition. And obviously, there's some inflationary pressures, and I'm just not quite sure if you put all that to a pot what that yields in terms of how you're thinking about pricing.
All right. Thank you. As you know, we launch with an extremely attractive opening price point on Disney+, and we've been very comfortable with the price-value relationship that we've offered. And as you know, as we increase our content investment, we believe that that's going to give us the ability to adjust our price by -- and still, at the same time, maintain that strong value proposition.
You mentioned the Disney+ ad tier I think this is going to give us the ability to reach an even more broad audience as we expand Disney+ across multiple price points. And using some of our other services, we can see the additive nature of an ad-driven service that enables us to keep the price lower. Of course, that's made up for by the additional revenue that we would get per user on the advertising spending. So we believe that we can sort of move up and cascade up our net price over time given the tremendous value that we started with and the increased price-value relationship of all the new content, but we're pretty bullish about that.
Next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thanks. Good afternoon.  A question and if I can, Alexia, just a clarification from the prepared remarks. On parks, as you know, you'll start to lap some really strong significant double-digit per-capita growth as you move through the rest of the summer and into the fall. And I'm just wondering, particularly given how focused everybody is on the economy and inflation, the consumer, if you're seeing any signs that would suggest that you're going to see substantial deceleration or even maybe not grow your per capita growth at the domestic parks.
Just be curious on how you're thinking about the full year and as you lap these comparisons. And then, I just wanted to come back, Christine, on the second half net adds. Are you still expecting a stronger second half at Disney+ than the first half and you're just calling out that maybe the relative comparison won't be as pronounced? I just wanted to make sure I understood what you -- we understood what you were saying. Thank you.
Bob, why don't you take the first half and then Christine can follow up?
OK. So we continue to see really strong demand, and we're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing, particularly as we're going to get some improvements to international visitation. But we're controlling our attendance, as Christine mentioned in her comments, using our reservation system to optimize the guest experience. But that domestic yield strategy, and we're also seeing it in Paris, is really exceeding our expectations.
If you remember, last quarter, we mentioned that we had some high hopes for it, but we were seeing well above what we had anticipated. Well, I'm happy to say that in Q2 we're even, as you say, we're lapping those numbers again even higher. So we're very, very encouraged by the continuation of the trends that we're seeing in terms of the number of people. For example, that sign-up for Genie+, plus the willingness to come to our parks with our balanced reservation system, which really helps us sort of manage our price per day, if you will.
So that domestic yield strategy has really structurally allowed us to increase that per-capita spending meaningfully without having to rely solely on raising ticket prices, and we don't see any end in sight for that.
Great. Ben, your question on net adds for the second half of the year. We still do expect an increase over the first half. However, the first half came in better than expected, so that delta that we had initially anticipated may not be as large.
But we still do expect an increase in the second half to exceed the first half.
Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Thank you. I have two. First would be, Bob, it seems that the equity markets are now focused on, kind of, the cost to achieve subscriber growth and maybe not just focused on the sub numbers as much as the cost to achieve. So I wonder, given the rising content costs you're seeing in things like sports and competition around the globe, how do you measure maybe the need to drive shareholder returns versus attaining those sub targets that were laid out in 2020? And how do you -- and how and when will you determine what the ROIC would be on maybe the next 100 million subs versus the first 100 million subs? And then, Christine, can you talk a bit about any type of incremental margins at the parks? Very strong so far, halfway through the year.
Any type of inflation on the parks that could limit maybe the margin growth we've seen at this point? So thanks.
So as you know, we're very carefully watching our content growth -- content cost growth. And we reaffirmed, as you heard earlier, our targets, our guidance on both subs and on profitability. So we think they move together. It's obviously a balancing act, but we believe that great content is going to drive our subs, and those subs then in scale will drive our profitability.
So we don't see them as necessarily counter. We see them as sort of consistent with the overall approach that we've laid out. We're extremely happy with the content that we've got both across the general entertainment option, which frankly is -- you heard that 50% of our subs are families without kids. And so, at the same time, that relative content expenditure is a little cheaper than our typical franchise expenditure on a per-program basis.
So even though we're adding a lot of content both in local, international markets and as well in the general entertainment area, it doesn't come at the per-title level, if you will, that we've been seeing sort of to date on our general franchise films. That said, we're balancing all three. And we're very confident that going forward, we're going to hit both of those sub guidance and profitability guidance by bringing in the cost at a reasonable level relative to their ability to attract and retain our subs.
Hi, Michael. On the parks margins, as Bob said, we feel really good about the consumer demand and what we're seeing in the forward-looking bookings and everything else in the attendance levels. So we feel good about that portion of margins. The one that is more challenging is what we face with inflation.
But we do pay close attention to all the recent inflationary pressures, and it covers everything from merchandise to food and beverage. I'll give you an example of something -- for those, we are actually always looking at mitigating impacts of rising costs. But I'll give you a good example of one that we are executing on, and that is the increased cost in fuel. We have a very robust fuel hedging program at Walt Disney World, and that reduces risk and minimizes volatility, reduces volatility in the cost of fuel.
And so, that -- while we suspended that program while the parks were shut, we have reopened that program and we are doing what we can to minimize the impact on that particular cost. We do have the labor impacts. Rising wages is something everybody is dealing with and a tighter labor market. On the supply chain, our business isn't immune to the global supply chain challenges.
And to the extent we experience any product availability impacts given strong demand that we're seeing, we're working with our suppliers to diversify some of our suppliers, and we're also working with shippers to expedite time to receive those through shipping. But right now, it's very difficult to accurately forecast the potential financial impact due to the fluidity of the situation. But you can trust that we are fully aware of it, and we're working hard to mitigate any pressure on the margins.
From Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Thank you. I have one big question, one multipart. Can you -- with the upfronts coming next week, can you give us some -- any color on how you're thinking about what this year's upfront will be like given changes in measurement, multiple platforms that you're selling across and, of course, the economy? And staying with the theme on -- given your upcoming rollout of the AVOD platform for Disney+, you already have Hulu ad inventory, and as you're adding Disney+, do you think this will grow the pie overall for Disney advertising dollars? Or will this ultimately just drive share shift from traditional broadcast linear? Is it incremental or not? How are you thinking about that? And how much do you think that having an ad-supported service will increase overall TAM for subscribers?
OK. Let's see. I'm going to take the first part first. We're expecting a very positive reaction from advertisers overall.
And as you suggest, this is a combination of our excitement around the Disney+ ad tier. They have been asking for this for years. And we also expect Hulu, as you know, which has been very strong for us at the same time, to be a key contributor of our performance at the upfront this year. The other thing is that sports are going to continue to be in high demand.
And so, with the advertisers, we focused on the right deals that we've made over the past few years, as well as our robust slate of original content shows and studio shows and original content games. In terms of sort of the growing-the-pie idea, we believe that the value proposition of advertising with Disney+ is only enhanced with our addition of an ad-supported tier on Disney+. So we believe it's good for the consumer because it's going to give us another entry price point, but it's also going to be great for the advertisers. Our advertisers increasingly are looking for multiple platforms to reach a broader reach.
And we think that as a company, we're going to provide that given our portfolio of streaming and our linear networks. So I think we're creating more avenues, both for consumer choice and for comprehensive advertising solutions, for our advertising customers at the same time.
From Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Thanks. Just two. Maybe first, Bob, what's holding you back from making ESPN+ a fully a la carte sports network? Disney historically has always been more aggressive in the pivot to streaming than some of the peers. We've already seen some of the peers put a lot of their key sports like the NFL on to streaming.
You talked a lot about how much the bundle is working with Disney+ and Hulu. So just really wondering how you're thinking about all the content you've got on ESPN+ and what it would take to make that fully a la carte and drive the DTC strategy even harder. And then, Christine, I have asked this before, so I'm just going to try again. Of the $32 billion in content spend, any help in sizing maybe how much of that is either general entertainment or local content? Thank you very much.
OK. So as you know, on all of our linear networks, they're huge cash generators for us. So to some extent, we're doing a really good job of chopping down some of the debt that we've had to accumulate due to either acquisition or through the COVID challenge. And so, the hesitancy to move too fast away from those is really a cash flow situation that I think puts our company in a healthier overall situation.
At the same time, we're very conscious of our ability to go more aggressively into the DTC area of ESPN. And so, what we're doing is sort of putting one foot on the dock, if you will, and one foot on the boat right now. But we know that at some point when it's going to be good for our shareholders, we'll be able to fully go into an ESPN DTC offering the way that you described. And we fully believe that there is a business model there for us that's going to enable us to regain growth on ESPN+ in a full DTC expression.
But at that point, obviously, that will have ramifications on immediate cash flow that we get from our legacy linear networks.
OK. Steve, to answer your question on that $32 billion of content spend and where it's going, remember back when we talked about that initially, we talked about it being about one-third in sports. That still remains. And when you think about the balance of that $32 billion, a meaningful amount of it will be enterprisewide content budget that will be dedicated into investments into the general entertainment content that we can leverage across all of our various distribution platforms.
When we say that, we mean linear, theatrical, as well as direct-to-consumer. And as I mentioned earlier, our world-class creative teams are focused on creating content that will drive subscriber growth in targeted segments and deeper engagement across the platform. This includes leveraging our existing intellectual property. Also, we're intent on creating new franchises.
You saw that in Encanto and investing in general entertainment, local language content and sports rights. I just want to -- even though you didn't ask about local language content, I do want to give you some perspective because we haven't provided this previously. But as Bob mentioned, we have about 500 shows in the pipeline for local content outside of the US or English speaking. When you look at that 500, I'll give you some broad breakdowns.
In the Asia Pacific region, including Southeast Asia, of that 500, 140 is in that region. In EMEA, it's 150. In India, it's 100. And in Latin America, it's 200.
Next question is from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Thank you. A couple, if I could. So Bob, first, I guess, when we think about the streaming goal, if we are really looking at 240 million subs at the midpoint, with the new ad-supported streaming service, what proportion of the base do you expect will be on that tier versus normal premium tier, especially given the fact that now you may have to do more than 50 million subs a year to get to that goal given the trend lines for this year? So that would be the first one. And secondly, I don't think Disney has been able to release a movie in China since 2019.
If you could just help us understand what the roadblocks there are and when we could see some change in that process? Thanks.
OK. I'm going to start with China. And the situation there has been very fluid, and as you probably guess, very complicated both from a business standpoint and from a political standpoint. But as you know, we've got a long record of success and a strong fan base for our brands and franchises in this market.
And our most recent releases were Death on the Nile and Encanto. And we'll continue to submit our films for release. And it's worth noting, I think, though, that at the time that we're having some difficulty in getting our films in China that Doctor Strange did extraordinary. We've just crossed $500 million in less than a week without this market.
So we're pretty confident that even without China, if it were to be that we continue to have difficulties in getting titles in there, that it doesn't really preclude our success given the relatively lower take rate that we get on the box office in China than we do across the rest of the world. Christine, do you want to talk about streaming?
Sure. On streaming, right now, we have not disclosed a mix or expected mix of an ad-supported tier. So we don't have any additional details on that product, and that includes pricing as well. But when we expand Disney+ across multiple price points with this new Disney+ ad tier, we are able to reach an even broader audience, and we'll create more avenues for consumer choice.
And this is a consistent theme that you've heard from us, having the consumer be our North Star. We'll continue to evaluate what makes sense for the service, our brand and our core principle of providing consumers with the maximum flexibility and choice. So we expect the advertising revenue we earn will contribute positively to our ARPU as we look to achieve our long-term profitability goals.
Question is from Philip Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
I have a couple of follow-ups, if I can. Thank you. On parks, can you talk about where the parks are -- the US parks are in terms of staffing and cost, as well as the potential for upside or not in those domestic attendance numbers for customers? And then, Bob, if I can go back to your comment on ESPN going all online someday. I think most of us expect us to happen eventually.
Clearly, that will be a huge change in the P&L at both DTC and linear. When that happens, does the overall profitability of the company take a hit for a year or 2? And how does the long-term sports on ESPN+ model work? And what's the structure of that versus what we've seen in the past of a purely linear model? Thanks very much.
Christine, do you want to start with the first question? And then, Bob second.
Sure. On our parks business, we're obviously extremely pleased with our domestic parks operations and how they have come back robustly. But on domestic attendance, we could, but we're choosing to limit attendance using our reservation system. And once again, that goes back to us trying to balance demand and attendance throughout the year, not have days when consumers in the parks aren't enjoying the experience.
So attendance is something that we're controlling, but we're doing it to have a better consumer experience. And some of the things that we've brought back, we will continue to with additional capacity. But some capacity that we just brought back in April were things like the character meet-and-greets at our domestic parks. And we also brought back in April our Nighttime Spectaculars at the Disneyland Resort.
And we'll also be opening a new attraction at Walt Disney World, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at the end of this month on Memorial Day weekend, and that is all new capacity, and we're really looking forward to having our guests experience that.
OK. And on the ESPN question, we're not ready to share the specifics of our model in terms of how long it would take for us to reach profitability on that or the impact that it would have on our linear business. But I would emphasize that we're only going to do it if it's accretive to our shareholder value when it comes time to actually pull the trigger. But I can tell you that it will be the ultimate fan offering that will appeal to super fans that really love sports.
And I think there's nobody but ESPN that, frankly, could actually pull that off. But we don't have a lot of specifics when it comes to structure. But we do believe that because sports is so powerful, in fact, in the last quarter, 46 of the top 50 most viewed programs on linear TV were sports. And obviously, ESPN dominates that.
And I do believe that sports is the third leg of our domestic offerings in terms of our DTC offerings, and right now, that expression is through the bundle. And I think that could become very powerful for us going forward in the future.
From Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Thanks so much for taking the question. So I guess two questions, if I could. Bob, you've continued to suggest a lot of confidence in Disney+ guidance. Can you talk about trends for churn and engagement for Disney+? And I'm not sure if you're willing to share how much of Disney+ viewing is new content versus library, just thinking as more and more new content starts to show up and ramp.
And then, separately, and maybe this is for Christine, Alexia, you'll let me know. But I'm just curious what you think the international fee park margin potential because it peaked at 16% in fiscal '19. I think we're getting a pretty good idea that the domestic theme parks is going to be very, very profitable. But international is still a bit of a mystery.
I know you've got some parks closed and there's some disruption, but you also have a good idea of what you're seeing in the US, how you could apply that overseas and what you've done with the cost structure during the pandemic. And also, if you look back at fiscal '19, sorry for making the question a little bit longer, but Hong Kong was shut down for part of the year; China was, what, in year three. So I'm just curious if those international margins, do we think about the getting closer and closer to US margins over time? Thanks so much.
Bob, why don't you take the first half and then Christine can follow up on parks.
OK. In terms of our confidence in Disney+ guidance, as you probably know, we have a tremendous amount of data that we get on our DCC platforms, things like the first view, what's the first view that somebody watches when they first come on to our platform, which is a pretty good proxy for maybe why they signed up. There's also the amount of time spent, the engagement scores and then, of course, the churn, information that you sort of look at. And we've said this before in past earnings calls, but we're extraordinarily pleased with the low churn that we see, particularly given the bundle.
The bundle is really efficient in terms of churn. And that gives us a lot of bullishness when it comes to the idea of bigger offerings from Disney. So as we sort of take each of these elements, when we get a new piece of content, we'll look at first view, we'll look at engagement, we'll look at the amount of time they spend on it. And we can model.
We can do a lot of modeling. And that modeling suggests that in addition to things like local market content, new content coming online, both in terms of general entertainment and from franchises, as well as new markets being added that that Disney+ guidance is going to be very achievable for us both in terms of the sub adds and in terms of the operating performance.
OK. On international theme parks, Doug, on Asia, I think it's really too early for us to tell. And as you heard in my comments, we said that we could see a negative impact of Hong Kong and Shanghai of $350 million in the next quarter, so just keep that in mind. But it is a bit of a tale of two cities.
I can give you some very positive trends we're seeing out of Disneyland Paris. So just like domestically, we're seeing very strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris. And we're looking forward to its continued recovery, particularly with the recent launch of their 30th anniversary celebration. Avengers Campus, that's the first new themed area of our multiyear expansion that we've talked about previously for DLP, that will open this summer.
And what has already opened is the -- one of our large hotels over there, the New York Hotel, has been rethemed in a Marvel theme and Avengers theme. So that's very exciting. And our guests love staying there. So I think what we're seeing in Paris gives me hope.
Hope is not a strategy, but it gives me hope that our other parks in Asia will see that same rebound when their COVID-related headwinds abate.
If I could just follow up, maybe the simple way to put it is, you've talked about the potential for higher park margins than previous peak. Would that apply to both domestic parks, and separately, international parks longer term?
Well, Doug, we've said it for domestic. We're not going to update that for international. There's just too much uncertainty with the region in Asia that has two of our parks right now.
All right. Thanks so much.
Operator we have time for one more question.
Thank you. From Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. I have a couple on this advertising tier we're talking about for Disney+. My first is, can you share anything else on what remains to be done prior to the rollout, the implementation of that advertising tier? Are there assets you need to acquire? Or what are you building or anything like that given the pieces that you do already have in place through your ownership of Hulu, etc.? So I'm curious about the advertising infrastructure.
And then, the second, you touched on this a little bit, Christine, but I'm curious if you can share any more relative sizing of the ARPU potential of the ad-supported service. Given that Disney+ is still half the price of Netflix domestically, I'm curious if ad-supported ARPU could actually be higher than where you are right now and if this does present a catalyst for you to raise price on the ad-free service. Thank you.
Bob, why don't you start and then Christine can finish.
OK. We're in really good shape in terms of being able to meet our timing with our Disney+ ad tier. And that's largely because we're already doing it. The combination of our ESPN+, streaming tech stack and our experience in Hulu and the software, we think that our current advertising capabilities really substantially prepare us to already bring this tier into operations.
So there's nothing that we need to go acquire or, frankly, even in any significant way developing anything new. And that's due to the ongoing investments in technology that we've made over time to increasingly automate much of this process. And we've been looking forward to this for a while. So this is something that's well-greased, if you will.
And our teams are hard at work at making that become a reality.
So on the incremental information you had touched pm our ad-supported tier. At this time, we haven't announced a price point for it. So we're not going to do that today. But we will continue to evaluate what makes sense for the service in terms of pricing.
And I will say that you can look to our experience with Hulu and their ad-supported tier. We believe that this will contribute to ARPU. And we look at it as certainly something additive that will work toward achieving our long-term profitability goals.
OK. Thanks for the question, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today.

1,"It's not easy to choose an accounting software application. There are a ton of choices out there, and they're all clamoring to get your attention. But not all accounting software applications are created equal.
Some excel in invoicing while coming up short on other key accounting features, while others include stellar reporting options but only offer basic accounting capability. So which one is right for you? Read on and find out.
Zoho Books and FreshBooks are both popular accounting tools, but their utility may vary, depending on the kind of business you own.
Though both applications are designed for small business owners with limited accounting knowledge, and both offer good bookkeeping and accounting features, Zoho Books and FreshBooks present two very different options for small business owners.
We break down the differences and the similarities to make the decision-making process a little bit easier.
Zoho Books is a good entry-level accounting application that currently offers three affordably priced plans and is a good FreshBooks alternative. A good fit for sole proprietors, freelancers, and small businesses, Zoho Books can be a good fit if your business centers around selling products.
If you're self-employed, working as an independent contractor, consultant, or sole proprietor, FreshBooks was designed for you. FreshBooks recently restructured their pricing levels, now offering four plans, making it easier to scale up to a more powerful plan if necessary.
Both Zoho Books and FreshBooks offer a great selection of features, although the features can vary significantly from product to product.
Zoho Books offers excellent sales management features such as customer estimates, custom invoicing, the option to create recurring invoices, and the ability to manage payments.
You can easily convert a sales order or an estimate to an invoice, and if you're looking for a completely customized invoice, Zoho Books will guide you step-by-step through the invoice creation process. After making a sale, you'll be able to keep track of all your customer's details.
The client portal makes it easy for your customers to pay their invoices online, and it expedites the approval process for both quotes and estimates, while also allowing your clients to easily manage their personal information themselves.
For those selling products, Zoho Books can be particularly helpful, as it offers inventory management features, such as the ability to track items using different units of measurement. You can also track a cost and a selling price for any product for easy tracking of cost of goods sold, and stock on hand is tracked in real time.
In addition, Zoho Books lets you add a product image to your inventory file, set reorder levels, and create custom markup and markdown lists for preferred customers.
Zoho Books also includes good vendor management, so go ahead and assign a payment method to each vendor. Expenses can be uploaded directly into Zoho Books by snapping a picture of a receipt, and if you pay a vendor the same amount monthly (think rent), you can create a recurring bill.
Other notable features in Zoho Books include bank connectivity, time tracking, and a mobile app for both iOS and Android devices. However, one of Zoho Books biggest downsides is the lack of a payroll module either within the application or as an integrated app.
FreshBooks offers a long and continually updated list of features. But among all the new features and functions, one that still stands out is invoicing. FreshBooks has made the act of creating an invoice a simple process that takes less than a minute. And these aren't plain, run-of-the mill invoices.
You can create a professional-looking FreshBooks invoice with your own logo and accent colors effortlessly using the invoice generator feature in FreshBooks. Invoice a new client immediately without having to stop and enter their personal details.
You can make the invoice recurring, set a notification option if the customer is late with their payment, and add a late fee if you wish. If you sell globally, you can create your invoice in your customer's native currency.
Payment is easy as well, since you can add a payment link that takes your customer directly to FreshBooks Payments, where they can pay by credit card or ACH transfer. You can also accept electronic payments using Stripe.
It's been a little over a year since FreshBooks added double-entry accounting capability to their application, making it a true bookkeeping and accounting application, a must for anyone who wants to add employees, accrue expenses, or grow their business.
Other useful features in FreshBooks include the Retainers option, great for attorneys, CPAs, or consultants who provide recurring services to clients, allowing you to budget and reserve blocks of time on a recurring basis.
Expenses are easily tracked in FreshBooks, and you can snap a photo of a receipt using its mobile app (available for both iOS and Android smartphones and other devices), later uploading the photo and dropping it into the expense screen.
Another great feature is the time-tracking feature, complete with a timer that can be used on your desktop or mobile device for conveniently tracking time from any location. While payroll is not included in FreshBooks, it does offer integration with Gusto.
It's a tie. While Zoho Books may be the best option for businesses selling products, FreshBooks is the better choice for service businesses.
Support availability is always important, but perhaps more so to new business owners who are learning their way around the bookkeeping process and learning a new software product at the same time.
While Zoho Books and FreshBooks are both easy-to-use applications, it's still nice to know that support is only a phone call away.
Zoho Books offers excellent choices when you need extra help, with both telephone and email support options available.
In addition, Zoho Books offers numerous resources designed to support new users including a migration guide, a quick navigation guide, and an extensive selection of resources designed to make new users feel comfortable using the application.
Other resources include access to a user community, FAQ page, and numerous webinars, which you can register for on the Zoho Books website.
FreshBooks is so easy to use that it's likely you'll never have to call support. But if you do, there's live support personnel on the other end of the phone, ready to answer your questions.
FreshBooks also offers excellent online support options like a searchable knowledge base that will likely answer most of your questions. You can also access support via email during extended business hours.
Zoho Books wins this round. Although both offer live support options, Zoho Books also includes a variety of user guides and step-by-step help throughout the application.
Ideally, when you log into your accounting software, you should be able to view the home page and know instinctively how to access the features you need.
While not the case for all software applications, both Zoho Books and FreshBooks offer intuitive user-navigation screens, so you don't have to spend a lot of time training, but can jump right in and start entering data.
Zoho Books makes it easy to get started, though your first session can take a bit of time. During the Zoho Books setup process, you'll need to enter details about your business, add sales tax information for your area, enable the modules that you want to use, and finally connect to online payment apps.
Once those steps are complete, you can return to the dashboard, which provides video overviews, helps you set up your client portal, and guides you through the rest of the setup process.
Zoho Books has a vertical navigation bar which allows you to choose the modules you want to access. Clicking on a module will display a drop-down menu that includes all the options within that module. Data-entry screens are uncluttered and offer easy access to Help and other resources should you get stuck.
New users can sign into FreshBooks and immediately know how to access a particular feature. Once signed in for the first time, you'll be directed to the dashboard, where you can start the entire setup process.
As you make your way through the setup process, you'll be able to see your progress displayed. Once setup is complete, you're ready to start entering transactions using the sidebar to the left of the dashboard.
FreshBooks entry screens are uncluttered and efficiently arranged, so you don't have to scroll through a lot of information in order to access the areas you need, and this structure remains the same throughout the application.
Each time you enter a transaction for the first time, FreshBooks will display additional help resources on-screen. You can also access help from any screen in the application.
FreshBooks is the winner here. While both applications are easy to use and offer multiple resources specifically designed for new users, FreshBooks takes it one step further with an intuitive interface that new users will be comfortable with immediately.
For sole proprietors and very small businesses, pricing can be an issue. Even if you don't face budgetary constraints, no one wants to overpay for something. Both Zoho Books and FreshBooks are affordably priced and within the range of just about any business, even those with a very tight budget.
The scalability of Zoho Books is one of its most attractive features, with the Standard plan offering more than enough in the way of features for a sole proprietor or small business just starting out, while giving you the flexibility to move up to a more powerful plan when it becomes necessary.
Pricing for Zoho Books is among the lowest in the industry, and all plans include custom invoicing, expense tracking, budgeting, sales, and bank reconciliation. There are currently no payroll options available in Zoho Books.
All FreshBooks fees are reasonable, and all plans include unlimited custom invoicing, unlimited expense entries, the ability to accept online payments, unlimited time tracking, and bank connectivity. If you have employees to pay, FreshBooks also offers integration with Gusto Payroll.
FreshBooks wins again. The pricing structures in Zoho Books and FreshBooks are similar, but the special pricing FreshBooks is offering makes this a deal too good to pass up.
Integration may not matter to you right now, but that might not always be the case. If you think you might need your software solution to integrate with other applications, here's how Zoho Books and FreshBooks stack up.
Zoho Books offers excellent integration options, including payment gateways such as Stripe, PayPal, Worldpay, WePay, and Square.
Other integrations include Slack, Microsoft Office 365, Fundbox, and Avalara as well as complete integration with Zoho Suite applications such as Zoho CRM, Zoho Inventory, and Zoho Sign. In addition, the application offers access to more than 500 additional apps through Zapier.
FreshBooks offers integration with more than 100 apps as well as an additional 1,500 apps through Zapier. Popular integrations include Gusto, Stripe, Bench, Shopify, Zoom, Acuity, Avalara, Taxfyle, eBay, Slack, Salesforce, and Eventbrite.
It's a tie. If you're looking for integration with more apps, FreshBooks is tops, but if you're looking for integration with numerous online payment applications, Zoho comes out on top. Either way, the integration options are considerable.
Reporting requirements can vary widely from company to company. You may be perfectly content with having access to a few good reports, while the business next door desires a more comprehensive selection of reports. If reporting choices are important to your business, see how Zoho Books and FreshBooks compare.
Zoho Books includes more than 50 reports that cover numerous categories, including accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory, invoicing, purchases and expenses, and taxes. A financial dashboard is also available if you're looking for a quick summary of your business activity.
Any Zoho Books report can be customized, and you have the option to schedule reports to run when you want them to. If Zoho Books customization isn't enough, you can export any report to Microsoft Excel or as a CSV file.
FreshBooks reporting options are fairly basic, though they should be sufficient if you're self-employed. Currently FreshBooks includes 12 reports, including standard financial statements.
Available reports include a Retainer Summary report, an Accounts Aging Report, a Revenue by Client report, and a Time Entry Details report.
A dashboard report that highlights outstanding revenue, total profit, revenue streams, spending, and unbilled time is also available, and all reports can be exported to Excel for customization if desired.
Offering more than 50 standard reports, Zoho Books wins this one. Both products offer a financial dashboard for a quick view of your business finances.
Zoho Books and FreshBooks are both strong contenders in this head-to-head comparison, and although our winner is FreshBooks, Zoho Books isn’t very far behind. In many cases, Zoho Books may be the better option for your business, particularly if you’re interested in using other Zoho applications.
However, if you’re a new business owner, or a new accounting software user, FreshBooks makes it easy for you to get started, with a simple user interface, surprisingly powerful bookkeeping and general ledger capability, and a good selection of features that will have you entering financial transactions for your business a lot faster than you might believe.","FreshBooks and Zoho Books, two of NerdWallet’s picks for best accounting software, aren’t as scalable as products like QuickBooks Online and Xero, but can be affordable choices for specific types of small businesses.
Whereas FreshBooks offers more third-party integrations for freelancers and independent contractors, Zoho Books pulls ahead for its higher user limits and more complex feature set. The choice depends on which third-party apps your business uses (and whether they integrate), along with what type of reporting capabilities you need, among other factors.
Has a strong invoicing feature; app lets users send invoices on the go, scan receipts and track mileage; basic inventory tracking for billable items; least expensive plan lacks double-entry accounting reports.
Includes robust reporting tools, but offers fewer reports than competitors; has customizable invoicing features, advanced inventory control in higher tier plans and a capable mobile app.
Auto-categorizes transactions for you, but you can’t set up your own bank rules; no global search function; least expensive plan lacks bank reconciliation tools.
Includes tools that help automate the reconciliation process; auto-categorizes transactions for you and lets you set up your own bank rules; no global search function.
Can support freelancers, contractors and small businesses with a handful of employees; highest-tier plan includes two users (additional users can be added for a fee).
Typically serves businesses with fewer than 100 employees; highest-tier plan includes 15 users (additional users can be added for a fee).
Least expensive plan doesn’t allow accountant access; lacks complete audit trail.
Has audit trails and offers easy accountant access; less popular than other competitors.
Integrates with more than 100 third-party apps; limited choices for direct payroll and point-of-sale integrations.
Integrates with fewer than 50 third-party apps; limited choices for direct payroll and point-of-sale integrations; no live bookkeeping integrations.
Includes phone support in all plans 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET from Monday to Friday; offers email support, but not live chat support with a human.
24/5 phone and live chat support included in all paid plans.
Plans start at $17 per month.
Offers a free plan, plus a range of paid plans.
Project tracking tools in higher-tier plans; lacks industry-specific reports and transaction tracking tags; users with multiple businesses must pay for separate subscriptions.
Includes project tracking tools in paid plans, along with transaction tracking tags; lacks industry-specific reports; users with multiple businesses must pay for separate subscriptions.
Accounting software typically enables accountant access in every plan — Zoho Books, for instance, even includes it in its free plan for businesses with less than $50,000 in annual revenue. However, FreshBooks’ least expensive Lite plan lacks basic capabilities like accountant access. Zoho Books also stands out from FreshBooks by keeping audit trails, which help accountants check books for errors or unauthorized transactions.
Before committing to Zoho Books, though, make sure that your accountant is familiar with it. The software isn’t as popular as FreshBooks.
If you like to dig into your reports or own a business with multiple departments, Zoho Books will likely be the better option. FreshBooks’ Lite plan doesn’t offer double-entry accounting reports (like a general ledger and balance sheet). Zoho Books includes these in every plan, plus more. All of its paid plans let you add reporting tags to transactions, so that you can drill into reports and separate results by location, department, etc.
Zoho Books’ inventory management features are also more robust. You can generate barcodes for items and set reorder levels so that you can see what’s running low at a glance. Separately, the software lets you create your own custom bank rules for categorizing incoming transactions. This can save you a lot of time if your business has a high volume of transactions flowing in from bank feeds each month. FreshBooks will suggest transaction matches for you, but you can’t set up your own rules for categorizing transactions that meet your set of criteria.
All FreshBooks plans, except the Select plan, only permit one user, so if you need to share your account with a co-owner or accountant, you’ll end up paying extra. Zoho Books’ user limits, on the other hand, scale up with plan tiers. It’s also less expensive to add additional users to Zoho Books vs. FreshBooks if you need to.
FreshBooks’ billable client limits in its Lite and Plus plans may be a drawback, too. You’re allowed up to five billable clients in the Lite plan and up to 50 in the Plus plan. Zoho Books doesn’t limit billable clients in any of its plans, including the free one. Instead, its free plan lets you send up to 1,000 invoices, which is more than many small businesses will send in one year.
Zoho Books is part of the larger Zoho suite of apps, so if you already use Zoho for other aspects of your business (such as customer relationship management, information technology or human resources), you can sync all your business management systems on one platform. If you don’t use other Zoho apps, however, the product’s sparse integrations with third-party tools might be a deal breaker.
For example, Zoho only integrates with Zoho Payroll or SurePayroll for payroll. If you use a different service, you won’t be able to integrate it with Zoho, leaving you with a lot of manual data entry. Compared with Zoho Books, FreshBooks offers greater options for third-party integrations.
Cost: $30 per month and up.
If you’re looking for more established software from a widely recognized and trusted brand, then check out QuickBooks Online. It’s a cloud-based option from Intuit, and while its plans are a bit more expensive, it has fewer restrictions than Zoho or FreshBooks.
With any QuickBooks Online plan, you get income and expense tracking, receipt capture, invoice tracking, reports and accountant access. Its least expensive plan comes with many of the features you’d expect to get from a mid-level plan from another provider. You also have the option to sign up for add-ons like time tracking or payroll.
Wave is one of the few free accounting software options for businesses. It allows unlimited bank and credit card connections, unlimited income and expense tracking and unlimited guest collaborators. The software also helps you implement invoice reminders when necessary.
Wave’s feature set isn’t the most robust, and customer service for its free products is limited to a self-service help center. However, it is still a comprehensive solution, and the price can make it an excellent choice for newer businesses or those on a strict budget.",Fool,nerdwallet
0.88,"Water is the most important commodity that we largely take for granted.
Water is essential not only for life but for a range of industries and almost all economic activities. From agriculture to beverages to industrial applications to consumer staples, there is a clear and growing demand for fresh, clean water, and there's only a limited supply. Add in the impact of climate change, which is shifting water flows and leading to potential water shortages all over the globe, and there is a pressing need for governments and the private sector to invest in water infrastructure.
A market with nearly unlimited demand and only limited supplies can make for an intriguing investment. There are a large number of water stocks to pick from, including utilities, filtration companies, and the makers of pumps and pipes needed to transport water.
But utilities tend to be limited in their geographic reach, and water tech and equipment companies are often specialists. You'd have to buy a lot of stocks to get exposure to the entire sector. With that in mind, it might make more sense to invest in water through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that gives you a small interest in a large number of companies focused on making sure clean water gets to where it is needed.
Investment management company Invesco (IVZ  -1.34%) dominates the water ETF market, and the Water Resources fund is its largest offering. Based on the NASDAQ U.S. Water Index, the fund seeks to track the performance of companies in the business of purifying, delivering, and conserving water for homes, businesses, and industries. It is not limited to companies that are doing business in the U.S., but it is heavily focused on stocks that trade on U.S. markets.
The five stocks represent about 39% of total assets. Invesco Water Resources has a 0.60% expense ratio.
The water ETF sponsored by First Trust Advisors is based on the ISE Clean Edge Water Index, which is composed of companies that derive a substantial portion of their revenues from the potable and wastewater industry. That can include utilities and other companies, but the index is weighed toward the companies that make the tech that helps to make water safe to drink.
The five stocks represent about 20% of total assets. The ETF has a 0.54% expense ratio.
As the name implies, the Invesco S&P Global Water Index gives you more international exposure and is based on the S&P Global (SPGI  -0.53%) Water Index. The fund aims to invest at least 90% of its total assets in securities tracking that index. The S&P Dow Jones Indices index the fund is based on is designed to measure the performance of the 50 largest global companies in water-related businesses.
The five stocks represent about 32.7% of total assets. The ETF has an expense ratio of 0.57%.
This, too, is an index fund, tracking the Nasdaq OMX Global Water Index. About 55% of fund assets are based in the U.S., followed by the U.K., Switzerland, and Japan. The fund also has exposure to emerging markets, including China and Brazil.
The five stocks represent about 37% of total assets. The ETF has an expense ratio of 0.75%.
Ecofin is a relatively new entry in the water ETFs and has a focus on sustainability. The fund will only invest in companies that derive at least 50% of revenue from the water industry or are ranked as a top company in a water category. Companies must also rank high on an ESG screen.
Combined, the five stocks represent about 36% of the portfolio. The ETF has a 0.40% expense ratio.
Plant-based eating has grown in popularity. These companies are in the middle of it.
Water isn't the most glamorous investment, but it is hard to think of a commodity more critical to society. Nations have gone to war over access to water. Those days are hopefully behind us, but given how widely water is used and the limited amounts of it available in many parts of the world, water should be an area of significant investment and growth in the years to come.
Buying into the water industry can provide a nice counterweight to more speculative tech investments or boom-and-bust cyclical companies. Buying ETFs instead of individual companies provides an easy way to gain geographic and subsector diversification without having to devote too much of your portfolio to the industry.","Water is one of the planet’s most coveted and widely used resources. Like other commodities, such as oil and gold, water assets can add significant diversification to any portfolio.
One way to gain exposure to the water industry is through a water exchange-traded fund (ETF). These ETFs invest in companies involved in the treatment and purification of water, as well as its distribution. Some notable names include Germany-based BASF SE (BAS.DE), 3M Co. (MMM), and ITT Inc. (ITT).
As an essential commodity, water ETFs are often used as a defensive position in a portfolio. However, to the extent that water scarcity becomes a growing threat, these ETFs could be a significant offensive play as well.
We examine the best three water ETFs below. All numbers below are as of Sept. 6, 2022.2 In order to focus on the funds' investment strategy, the top holdings listed for each ETF exclude cash holdings and holdings purchased with securities lending proceeds except under unusual cases, such as when the cash portion is exceptionally large.

0.875,"Many of us were not fortunate enough to buy shares of today's high-growth tech stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA 0.92%) at the initial public offering (IPO) price. But for a few reasons, it's a helpful exercise to look at how much money you would have made if you did get in at the beginning.
To start, it reinforces the power of compound returns on a relatively small investment. Along with that, it highlights the importance of patience. There may be some investors who did buy a $10,000 stake in NVIDIA around the IPO price, but did those investors keep holding after that $10,000 turned into $50,000? If not, they left a lot of money on the table.
It can be very tempting to sell a winner after it's risen in value, but investors who think of themselves as business owners will keep holding, knowing that it would be nearly impossible to find another company to invest in that is as good as the one they currently hold.
With that said, let's look at how much you would have made if you had bought shares of NVIDIA at the IPO price.
A $10,000 investment would have purchased 833 shares at the IPO price. Those shares would have turned into 9,996 shares after all the stock splits. At the current stock quote of around $214, the value of your investment would be $2,139,144.
To be honest, I probably would have been one of those investors who started selling some shares once my initial investment turned into $30,000 or $50,000. But if you have the mindset to let your winners run, all it takes is one moderate NVIDIA investment to make you a millionaire.
NVIDIA's business involves selling very pricey graphics cards that generate high margins. This allows it to generate more free cash flow than management knows what to do with, so the company takes some of that spare cash and pays a small dividend to shareholders. The current quarterly payout is $0.16 per share.
If you owned 9,996 shares, you would be earning $1,599 per quarter in dividend income, which comes to $6,397 over a year.
NVIDIA initiated its first quarterly dividend in 2012 at $0.075 per share. The dividend payout has more than doubled in the last seven years, and it should continue to increase over time as revenue and free cash flow grow.
Another reason that early investors of NVIDIA would have wanted to hang on to their shares is that the business has found more ways to grow over the last decade. The cumulative return of the stock since the IPO is 21,300%. Over the last 10 years, the stock price has increased by 1,290%. That means a $1,000 investment in December 2009 would have already turned into $13,900.
NVIDIA has long been known for its innovation in graphics cards for those who play video games on a PC. It's the market-share leader in the discrete graphics card market, leading its rival Advanced Micro Devices. But management has found additional applications for its core graphics technology, opening up a lot more possibilities for NVIDIA to expand.
More demand is coming from organizations that need powerful graphics chips to process mountains of data with artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (an advanced form of AI). NVIDIA has also formed partnerships with several leading automakers to develop self-driving cars using the NVIDIA DRIVE platform.
Sales of gaming graphics cards still make up most of NVIDIA's annual revenue, but the data center, professional visualization, and automotive segments are just as important to the company's future growth.
The stock is up 62% year to date, but it is still below the all-time high in 2018. NVIDIA suffered a setback last year from a slowdown in its gaming and data center business. With those markets starting to return to growth, it's not too late to consider adding shares of NVIDIA to your portfolio.
John Ballard owns shares of NVIDIA. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends NVIDIA. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.","Founded in 1993, American technology company Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) has grown to become one of the industry leaders in manufacturing graphic processing units for computer and gaming devices as well as Artificial Intelligence and enterprise computing. The company benefited from the artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency markets in 2017 with its shares rising 92%, but the stock has fallen 30 percent in 2018 as of November 22.
The company went public in January 1999, with its shares priced at $19.69 each. An investment of $1,969 would have bought you 100 shares, but after four stock splits you would now be the owner of 1,200 NVDA shares, and your initial capital with reinvested dividends would now have grown to $291,652 as of November 1, 2018. Check NVDA's most recent share price here.
While the company’s growth has fueled the astronomical gains for its stock price, stock splits and dividends also gave a big bump to initial investors.
A little over a year since its listing, the company executed its first stock split, offering two shares for one held by investors. That means an initial 100 shares would now become 200 shares. At the close price of $71.25, the $1,969 investment would now be worth $14,250, a 623% growth.
Just a year later, Nvidia decided to split its stock again, offering a 2:1 split. The number of shares held would now increase to 400, and at the price of $33.29, the investment would now be worth $13,596, a little lower than the previous year but still an impressive 590% return on the initial $1,969 investment.
In 2006, the company announced another 2:1 stock split. The number of shares now increase to 800 and at a price of $30.53 apiece, the investment is now worth $24,424 and spectacular 1,140% gain over the initial $1,969 investment.
The last of the stock splits so far, Nvidia offered a 3:2 split which means the 100 shares bought at the time of the IPO are now 1,200 shares. At a $34.58 price, the initial investment of $1,969 would now be worth $41,496, a 2,007% jump.
Nvidia paid out its first dividend in 2006, and the next payout was made six years later in 2012. Since November 2012, the company has declared a dividend every quarter, adding to the value of the investment.
If you had invested in 100 shares, an initial investment of $1,969, that money, including reinvested dividends, would have grown to $291,652, as of November 1, 2018, a whopping 14,712% return on investment.

0.875,"Guns are a controversial topic in U.S. politics, with arguments pitting gun-control advocates against defenders of Second Amendment rights. Companies that sell weapons often come under attack after mass shootings, and some investors get nervous about the business's long-term prospects. Yet gun stocks don't always react to changing sentiment in the way you would expect. For example, share prices often go up when the news puts more urgency on the issue of gun control; sales rise when the fear of tighter regulation spurs gun fans to stock up. By contrast, periods when there is no prospect that Washington will implement new gun regulations can be poor ones for weapons manufacturers, because that fear-based demand dries up. Such nuances make it crucial to understand the weapons industry before buying stock in a manufacturer.
We'll look at each of these factors below.
The first question investors need to ask is whether they want a pure play on guns or broader exposure. Some gunmakers have embraced related products in order to diversify their businesses. For instance, Smith & Wesson switched its name to  American Outdoor Brands a year ago in order to emphasize the non-gun products in its lineup, which include electronic optics, tree saws, flashlights, knives, and other accessories. Vista Outdoor goes even further, with offerings like Bushnell golf products, Bell and Giro cycling accessories, and Camelbak hydration systems to go with its Savage Arms gun and Federal Premium ammunition brands. Olin is a diversified conglomerate, making chemicals in addition to maintaining its Winchester brand.
Other companies maintain a tighter focus. Sturm, Ruger is well-known for its Ruger gun line, and it markets pistols, revolvers, and rifles along with an assortment of gun-related accessories. You'll find knives and pepper spray at the Ruger website, but it's clearly a weapons-centric business.
Image source: American Outdoor Brands.
Another thing to consider as an investor is which parts of the weapon industry you think is likely to thrive. Military weaponry goes well beyond guns, and the companies that produce sophisticated equipment like tactical missile systems, tanks, and attack aircraft are typically defense contractors with huge operations.
By contrast, gun manufacturers that serve the consumer market tend to be much smaller. Those more modest roots give them greater opportunities to grow, but the risks involved are consequently higher.
Investors who favor exchange-traded funds will be disappointed to learn that there are no gun-specific ETFs, and even some of the funds that focus on so-called ""sin stocks"" tend to shy away from gun manufacturers.
You can find plenty of ETFs that concentrate on defense stocks, so if military weaponry is your primary interest, then that's an option. To get exposure to companies like Sturm, Ruger and American Outdoor Brands, however, you'll have to buy individual company shares.
Gun manufacturers generally had a tough 2017, with a friendly political environment removing any sense of urgency among buyers. As companies adapt to changing conditions, however, many bulls are hopeful that gun stocks can recover and rise in 2018 and beyond.
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sturm wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

BlackRock said that 95% of its U.S.-listed ETFs do not hold those three gun stocks. The list of iShares ETFs that do hold shares of civilian gun manufacturers does, however, include some well-known ETFs. That list includes fixed income and equity products. As of Feb. 26, iShares ETFs holding gun stocks included the iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF (CRBN), iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) and iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR).

0.8571428571,"Korean SKYPASS is no longer a transfer partner of the Chase Ultimate Rewards program. Find out what this means for Chase cardholders and how much this could affect your travel plans. Image source: Getty Images.
Sometimes breakups happen without much warning. In the case of Chase and Korean Air, they gave customers just weeks of notice before ending their partnership on Aug. 25, 2018.
A significant benefit of Chase's Ultimate Rewards program has always been its numerous transfer partners, so seeing it lose one is a step in the wrong direction. Let's explore what the immediate ramifications are for this and how much of an impact it has.
Korean Air is the airline of choice for flights to South Korea, as it's the nation's largest carrier. It also offers flights to many of the mid to large-size destinations in Asia, with particularly impressive coverage in China, where it's one of the largest foreign airlines in operation.
If you frequently travel from the United States to Asia, were planning a vacation there, or live in South Korea, then the Chase-Korean Air breakup is a big loss. If you don't fall into any of those categories, it's less of an issue, especially considering there are still ways to book Korean Air flights using Ultimate Rewards points.
This will usually be the fastest and easiest option.
Transfer Ultimate Rewards points to Flying Blue -- Flying Blue is the rewards program for Air France and KLM, which are both in the SkyTeam airline alliance with Korean Air. With Flying Blue miles, you can book a Korean Air award flight on either Air France's or KLM's site. You'll need to find award space on the flight you want, which can make this option hit or miss.
These cards are only worth considering if Korean Air is your airline of choice. If not, there are travel rewards cards with more versatile rewards and benefits.
The loss of Korean Air doesn't have much of an effect on the value of Chase's Ultimate Rewards points, as there are many other partner airlines remaining. It'd be more of a problem if Chase lost Southwest or United, as those are major domestic carriers. Chase also added JetBlue as a transfer partner a day after dropping Korean Air, so you could call it a wash.
Considering how competitive the credit card market is, it's unlikely that Chase will do anything that makes its cards significantly worse. Instead, it will probably continue doing what it has been -- creating new rules that prevent consumers from churning through its cards to rack up more points and making small changes here and there in areas most people won't notice.
When it comes to credit card rewards programs, changes can happen at any time. Korean Air was a mainstay in the Ultimate Rewards program, until one day, it wasn't. Fortunately, those Ultimate Rewards points can still help you book a flight on Korean Air.","Chase Ultimate Rewards® members will have one less transfer partner by the end of August. The bank and Korean Air announced they made the mutual decision to end their relationship: Ultimate Rewards® points will no longer be transferable to Korean Air SKYPASS effective Aug. 25, 2018.
The move will end one SkyTeam transfer option with Ultimate Rewards® and create a roadblock for SKYPASS miles flyers who regularly booked Korean Air award flights. Despite the change, frequent flyers still have multiple ways to gain big from Ultimate Rewards® and other programs.
When Ultimate Rewards® ends its partnership with SKYPASS, several award sweet spots will disappear for Chase cardholders. This includes using SKYPASS miles to book flights on Delta Air Lines and other SkyTeam partners, or booking awards on Emirates as an airline partner.
As an alternative for Delta flights, Ultimate Rewards® can still be transferred to Virgin Atlantic Flying Club and used with Delta. Round-trip flights between the West Coast and Hawaii aboard Delta economy are available for 40,000 Flying Club points.
To use Ultimate Rewards® with SkyTeam partners, transfer points to Flying Blue, the combined loyalty program of Air France and KLM. Points transfer at a 1-to-1 ratio and usually deposit into a Flying Blue account instantly. Before moving points, be sure to look up award availability on the Flying Blue website. To confirm that an award ticket books correctly, it’s always a good idea to book awards over the phone instead of online.
Unfortunately, after the ending date there will be no easy way to directly book award flights for Korean Air, or on its luxury partners, including Emirates. Instead, flyers may be able to seek new awards through the new Ultimate Rewards® Travel center. Those who hold the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card can exchange points through the travel portal for 1.25 cents per point, while Chase Sapphire Reserve® can book travel through the portal at a value of 1.5 cents for each point.
If you fly between the United States and South Korea often, or find value in the SKYPASS program, there is one remaining option available: Korean Air offers SKYPASS-earning credit cards through U.S. Bank.
There are four levels of Korean Air SKYPASS credit cards, including the SKYPASS Visa® Secured Card. Before applying for one of the credit cards, be sure to read all the benefits to see which one makes the most sense for your budget.
After Aug. 25, none of the major bank rewards programs will offer transfers to Korean Air SKYPASS. Holding a Korean Air SKYPASS credit card will be the only way to consistently earn miles.

0.8510638298,"Here’s a look at the most common situations in which mold may—or may not—be covered by homeowners insurance.
Homeowners insurance policies spell out a list of “covered perils,” meaning instances of damage to the home for which you’re eligible to file a claim. The main cause of mold formation is water seeping into the structure of your home, so you need to know which water-related covered perils are included in your policy.
In these instances mold would be “resulting damage” from a covered peril. It’s important to distinguish between resulting damage and initial damage. For example, if your water heater breaks and a leak causes mold to form in the walls, then your policy might pay for the walls to be repaired and the mold to be removed but not for the replacement of the hot water heater.
It’s important to note that the amount your policy may pay for mold repair and removal might not cover all of the resulting damage. “This extent of mold coverage is typically limited—for example, a company may cap mold removal and remediation at $10,000 for a single occurrence,” says Pat Howard, homeowners insurance expert at Policygenius. Higher coverage limits may be available, but if you’re unsure about what’s covered, Howard suggests talking to your agent to find out what options you have.
When taking out homeowners insurance, pay close attention to coverage limits.
In some cases mold can grow as a result of water damage from outside forces. Whether your homeowners insurance covers mold in that instance depends on what caused the damage to begin with.
That may be worth the investment, however, if you’re concerned about mold resulting from a flood. According to FEMA, just one inch of water in your home can cause $25,000 in damage.2﻿ Flood insurance with mold coverage could help mitigate some of the cost.
Mold that results from other acts of nature, such as a hurricane or an ice storm, may be covered under your homeowners insurance policy. For instance, if a hurricane tears your roof off and water gets inside the home, causing mold to grow, you might be able to file a claim for that along with other damages to the home.
Say that you notice the seal around the base of your toilet is leaking water. Instead of replacing the seal or the toilet, you let the leak continue, which causes damage to the subflooring. From there, mold sets in and spreads to the baseboards and walls. In that instance your homeowners insurance policy claim may be denied because you were in a position to prevent the mold from happening.
There are several things you can do to prevent mold and/or improve the odds of having your claim approved if you incur mold damage.
If your homeowners insurance company denies your mold claim, you may want to get a licensed contractor to offer a second opinion on what caused the damage. You could also attempt to appeal the denial with your insurance company if it has a specified appeals process. If not, your state insurance commissioner may be able to offer help on what you can do to get the claim approved or to file a complaint about denial.
FEMA. ""Historical Flood Risk and Costs.""","A homeowners policy usually pays for mold damage only if it’s caused by a covered issue such as a burst pipe.
Homeowners insurance won’t pay to clean up mold due to flood damage.
There are certain types of coverage you can add to your homeowners policy to pay for some mold damage.
Whether your homeowners insurance covers mold damage largely depends on the cause of the mold. If you find mold in your home, here are the options that may be available to you.
Homeowners insurance generally covers mold only when it's caused by a ""covered peril"" — an event your homeowners insurance policy will pay for, such as accidental water damage.
For example, if your washing machine suddenly springs a leak and black mold develops on the floor, a homeowners policy will likely pay to remove the mold. If the floor is damaged beyond repair, your policy may also pay to replace it.
Water damage caused by extinguishing a fire.
A burst or frozen pipe.
Though your policy may cover mold damage from a broken appliance, it probably won’t pay to replace the device; most insurers cover only the resulting water and mold damage, not the cause of the damage.
Some insurance companies limit the amount they will pay for mold removal. So even if your insurer accepts your claim, you may still need to shoulder some of the costs.
Confused about your coverage? Read your policy carefully or call your insurance agent to go over the details.
Poorly sealed doors or windows.
A leaky faucet that you haven’t fixed.
Lack of ventilation in a moist room, like a bathroom.
Below are a few other common causes of mold damage that a standard home insurance policy usually won’t cover.
Sump pump failure and water backup damage. Damage caused by water backup or a sump pump failure can be costly, and standard home insurance policies usually won’t cover it. However, many insurers offer sump pump failure and water backup coverage as an optional add-on.
Flood damage. Standard homeowners policies generally exclude flooding. If you’re at risk, consider buying separate flood insurance.
However, even if you have flood insurance, your policy may not cover mold damage. The country’s biggest flood insurance provider, the National Flood Insurance Program, covers mold damage only if you can't access your home after a flood.
Mold damage coverage varies by the flood insurance policy. If you’re not sure what your policy includes, talk to your insurer.

Though a standard home insurance policy doesn't usually cover the above situations, that doesn't mean you're out of luck. Below are other options your insurer may offer.
Sump pump failure and water backup coverage can pay for water and mold damage from a backed-up drain, broken sump pump or clogged sewer line. However, sump pump failure and water backup coverage will likely not pay for gradual issues such as water leaking in through your home's foundation. It also won't cover issues like flooding caused by a rising river or lake near your home.
Hidden water damage coverage pays for damage from leaks you can’t see, like a burst pipe behind a wall. It could also cover mold cleanup. However, not all companies sell this insurance.
Mold can start to form in as little as one day, so acting fast is important.
Document the damage. Take photos and videos of mold and water damage you find. Make a list of everything that was damaged. Be as thorough and truthful as possible. False reporting, even if accidental, can work against your claim.
Clean up excess water, and dehumidify the area. Wipe up pools of water and use a dehumidifier or air conditioner to dry out the site. Place wet items outside in a secure area to dry. If you're having trouble cleaning up the water, consider hiring a professional. Your insurance agent may be able to help you find trusted water removal contractors in your area.
Make temporary repairs to prevent further damage. You don't want to make major fixes before filing your claim, but once you've documented the damage, make temporary repairs to protect your home from further damage. For example, if your basement is flooded, you can remove wet carpeting. Keep receipts for all purchases related to cleanup and repairs.
File as soon as you can. Depending on your insurer, you may be able to file your claim online, through an app or by phone. The sooner you file, the sooner you can clean up the mess (and the less time mold will have to form).
Inspect your pipes, faucets and hoses regularly, and fix leaks right away.
Make sure to direct rainwater away from your home.
Keep humidity low in your house by using air conditioners and dehumidifiers.
Improve bathroom and kitchen ventilation by installing exhaust fans.
Avoid putting carpet in areas at risk for collecting moisture, such as a basement or bathrooms.
Regularly inspect your roof for leaks and keep your gutters free of debris.
Consider replacing the hoses to your dishwasher, washing machine, refrigerator and other large appliances every five years.

0.8235294118,"Protective is our top choice for best term life insurance company. This is because it tied for having the lowest term rates of the companies we reviewed and is one of a handful of companies that provides 40-year term life insurance. It also offers a wide array of other policy types, meaning there’s a good chance you can find a policy suitable for you. But the company scored poorly in a consumer satisfaction survey and doesn’t include as many no-cost living benefit riders as some other companies we reviewed.
Founded in 1907, Protective provides policies in all 50 states and has three operating locations. Its headquarters is in Birmingham, Alabama, and its two other core sites are in Greater Cincinnati and St. Louis. As one of five subsidiaries of the Protective Life Corporation, it provides a variety of methods to obtain coverage, including through Costco and independent agents.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) tracks the number of consumer complaints individual insurers receive, and uses that number to create a complaint index.2 The NAIC complaint index allows you to compare customer complaints across a range of companies, no matter their size. In this way, you can get an idea of how satisfied (or dissatisfied) customers are with the company.
The benchmark is 1.0—which represents the number of complaints a company is expected to receive. A company with a score above 1.0 indicates it received more complaints than expected. Conversely, a score below 1.0 means the company had fewer complaints than expected.
Protective’s complaint index, averaged over three years, was 0.79, meaning the company received fewer complaints than expected.
Financial strength is a critical component to consider when choosing a life insurance company because a life insurance policy is a long-term financial contract—you want to be confident the company will be there and able to pay your beneficiaries when needed and as promised. A life insurance company’s AM Best rating is a good measure of this.
However, Protective does not perform as well when it comes to customer service. In fact, it scored well below average in the 2021 J.D. Power Individual Life Insurance Study. It came in 16th out of 21 carriers, scoring 752 out of a possible 1,000 points (the industry average was 776).
Protective offers a variety of policies and optional features so you can customize your coverage to best suit your needs. You can get a quote and apply for term life insurance online, but you’ll need to contact an agent for all other policy types. Most policies include a terminal illness accelerated benefit rider at no extra charge. The terminal illness rider allows you to accelerate up to 60% of the death benefit (or $1 million, whichever is less) if you have less than six months to live.
Term life insurance offers death benefit protection that lasts anywhere from one to 40 years or more. Unlike most permanent policies, it doesn't build a cash value, and is the most affordable type of life insurance coverage.
According to Protective, its premiums are usually among the top three on the market for similar product types, across all issue ages and face amounts—and our research supports this for term policies. Of the companies we collected term quotes for, Protective tied with Banner for cheapest term life insurance coverage.
Coverage lengths range from 10 to 40 years, with the option to convert to a permanent policy with no medical exam. Protective is one of only three companies we reviewed that offers 40-year term life insurance coverage.
Whole life policies provide life-long guaranteed protection, and build a cash value. Cash value is an essential component to permanent life insurance as it reduces the high cost of life insurance as you age. Over time it can become a source of funds that you can borrow from. In whole life policies, the cash value grows at a fixed rate and is guaranteed as long as you make payments when they are due.
If you decide a whole life policy is best for you because it grows cash value, it is wise to replace any cash you borrow or withdraw from your policy. Otherwise, you could reduce the death benefit for your beneficiaries, or, in some cases, the policy could lapse.
Protective offers its whole life policy to applicants from 0 to 90 years old for coverage of as little as $1,000 and as much as $5,000,000. The policy comes standard with a terminal illness accelerated death benefit at no extra cost.
Universal life (UL) insurance is a permanent policy that grows cash value; but unlike whole life, universal life allows you to adjust your premiums and death benefit.
Unlike other universal life policies, Custom Choice is not designed to provide permanent coverage, but is structured similarly to a term policy. You have the option to exchange it for a permanent policy during the second through 20th policy years, and you’ll pay a relatively low, level premium for a term of up to 30 years. If you want to exchange the policy for permanent coverage (with a higher premium), you won’t have to take a medical exam. It’s available to applicants 18-75 years old.
Variable life insurance can provide coverage for life. It gives you the ability to invest the policy’s tax-deferred cash value in the stock market. Investment options are available via “subaccounts;” choose which to invest in based on your risk tolerance and goals. You can use cash value to pay premiums, but if the investments lose value, your premium could go up.
Protective offers one VUL policy with a range of available features and investment options for applicants up to age 80.
While variable universal life insurance offers higher potential returns, higher returns often come with higher risks. For example, if your investments perform poorly, your premium could increase drastically or the policy could lapse.
If you’re looking for a permanent policy with more potential growth than whole life, but with less risk/reward potential than a variable UL policy, this might be the right choice for you. Indexed universal life (IUL) insurance has growth potential and flexibility with premiums and cash value options like other UL policies. However, the cash value is credited an interest rate based on the performance of a stock market index.
With Protective’s IUL policy, the stock market index used is the S&P 500. You also can choose to invest some (or all) of the cash value in a fixed account that earns interest at a flat rate.
The rate credited to your cash value will never be negative but is subject to limits. For example, if your policy caps gains at 6%, and the index gained 8%, you would be credited no more than 6%.
Guaranteed Insurability Rider (GI): A guaranteed insurability rider is ideal for a young person purchasing a permanent policy who thinks they may want more coverage in the future (say, because they intend to get married or have more children).
Children’s Term Rider: Available on Protective’s IUL, VUL, UL, and term policies, this optional rider provides death benefit protection for all children aged 15 days through 18 years. Coverage continues until age 25 (if the base policy is in force) and can be converted to permanent coverage without having to prove insurability - —meaning your child doesn’t have to take a medical or apply for coverage. A child term rider is an excellent way for parents to establish coverage for their children without purchasing a separate policy.
Waiver of Premium: This optional rider let’s you skip premium payments if you become disabled. Protective’s waiver of premium rider has a six-month elimination period—meaning you must live with the disability for six months before you’re eligible to have premiums waived (an elimination period is a common feature). The rider is available to applicants up to age 55, it expires once you turn 65, and is available on Protective’s term, UL, IUL, and VUL policies.
Accidental Death Benefit: An accidental death benefit rider pays an additional death benefit if you die as the result of an accident. Protective’s version is available on its term, UL, IUL, and VUL policies. It’s available up to age 60 and expires at age 65.
Accelerated Death Benefit: Life insurance with living benefits or accelerated benefit riders allows you to receive a portion of the death benefit early if you experience certain health-related events. Protective offers two—one for terminal illness and one for chronic illness. Only its terminal illness rider is available at no extra cost.
Protective representatives are available by phone at 800-866-9933 between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. Central Time (CT) Monday through Thursday, and between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. CT Friday. Account management features are available to policyholders online, such as submitting payments and submitting a claim.
When it comes to price, Protective can’t be beat. At least not in our analysis of quotes for 30-year $250,000 term life insurance policies for healthy individuals aged 25, 40, and 55 years old. In each age group, Protective had the cheapest term life insurance or tied for having the cheapest. And according to the company, premiums typically rank in the top three for similar products across issue ages and face amounts.
If price is a priority, start with Protective.
If you’re in the market for affordable, no-frills, long-term term coverage, you should consider Protective. It’s top-ranked for cheap term coverage, and offers 40-year-term life insurance—which is uncommon in the industry. The company has a wide range of universal life policies available as well, including a term-like UL policy that may be suitable if you want the flexibility of a cash value component, or the potential to build one.
However, if a comprehensive suite of living benefits is important to you, such as no-cost accelerated death benefit riders for chronic, critical, and terminal illnesses, consider other companies' offerings. And if you’re looking for a policy that pays dividends or if you have health issues and need a final expense policy, you should look elsewhere.

0.8072289157,"The economy would get nowhere without transportation stocks.
The business of getting people and goods from point A to point B is massive. Companies in the transportation industry run trains, trucks, planes, and ships, operate warehouses, and help manufacturers move goods. Globally, transportation is a $6 trillion industry. There are so many different companies doing so many different things that an investor could fill out an entire portfolio gaining exposure to every corner of the transportation world.
We've seen over the past few years how vital transportation is to the economy. Supply chain issues have been in the news throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with bottlenecks causing shortages in some key goods and helping to prompt fears of inflation. We've also seen the government and private sector pledge to invest massive sums in new transportation projects to ease the gridlock, creating potential opportunities for investors.
Given how broad the sector is, transportation is a natural fit for an exchange-traded fund, or ETF. An ETF allows investors to make one purchase and acquire shares in an entire range of companies operating in a single sector.
Here's are some of the top ETFs for investors looking for exposure to the transportation industry without having to buy a basket of individual companies.
The iShares US Transportation ETF (IYT  -0.54%) is the largest sector ETF, with $1.23 billion in net assets of of April 14, 2022. It has a broad target, attempting to provide exposure to U.S. airline, railroad, and trucking companies, and also mixing in some technology-infused transportation disruptors.
Overall, railroads make up 30.1% of the fund, while air freight and logistics companies comprise 28.7%, trucking has 21%, airlines take up 17%, and marine companies make up 1.6%. The iShares US Transportation ETF has an expense ratio of 0.41%.
The SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -0.38%) provides a broad view of the industry, defining transportation as air freight, airlines, airport services, trucks, rail, marine businesses, and port infrastructure. The ETF had $808 million in assets under management as of April 2022 and had 52 companies in its portfolio. The ETF is set up to track the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index.
Overall, airlines make up 34.8% of the fund, while trucking comprise 34.5%, air freight has 16.8%, marine makes up 7.8%, and railroads constitute 6.2%. The SPDR S&P Transportation ETF has an expense ratio of 0.35%.
The First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF (FTXR  0.2%) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Smart Transportation Index, which takes a pretty broad view of transportation. You'll see a lot more emphasis on personal transportation, including autos, in this list. The ETF had $211.7 million in assets as of April 14, 2022.
As of Dec. 31, 2021, trucking made up 17.5% of the ETF's assets, with rail comprising 17%, automobiles having 15.7%, and airlines making up 13.2%. The First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF has an expense ratio of 0.60%.
The SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF (HAIL  0.88%) is set up to generally track the Kensho Smart Transportation Index, seeking out companies with products and services that are pushing transportation into the digital age. That includes investments in autonomous vehicles, drones, and next-generation transportation systems.
Automakers account for 18.5% of the portfolio. Auto parts manufacturers make up 15%, construction machinery comprise 14.1%, semiconductors account for 11.4%, and electronic equipment has 6.6%. Overall, 18 subsectors are represented in the ETF.
The SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF has an expense ratio of 0.45%.
The Direxion Daily Transportation Bull 3X Shares (TPOR  -1.81%) ETF uses leverage to try to provide three times the returns of the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index. The strategy has a lot more potential upside than a traditional index-focused ETF but also a lot more risk. Leveraged ETFs tend to be more expensive to own, which is true in this case. The ETF has about $43.25 million in assets.
Overall, 60.1% of the ETF is invested in ""road and rail"" companies, while 26.5% is in air freight and logistics, 7.8% in airlines, and 5.6% in marine. The Direxion Daily Transportation Bull 3X Shares has an expense ratio of 0.98%.
The SmartETFs Smart Transportation and Technology ETF (NYSEMKT:MOTO) is designed to invest in the companies that will lead the evolution of transportation, including autonomous vehicles, flying taxis, electric powertrains, and transportation as a service. By its nature, this is a much more tech-centric list of holdings than a traditional transportation ETF. Investors might consider it a good way to invest in industry innovation without tying too much capital to one speculative company.
The SmartETFs Smart Transportation and Technology ETF has an expense ratio of 0.68%.
These companies can help your portfolio get where you want it to go.
Investing in exchange-traded funds of industrial companies is a way to play this vital sector.
The interesting thing about transports is that while the sector is vital to the economy, a lot of the individual companies have not been long-term winners. Subsectors such as airlines and truckers tend to be cyclical in nature, meaning the stocks tend to ebb and flow along with the economy.
These types of sectors -- where there is strong potential for future growth, but individual companies tend to post choppy performances -- are ripe for ETF investing because it gives an investor exposure to the broader trends without the risks that come with trying to pick individual winners.
The world needs well-functioning transportation systems, and the promise of technology has the potential to reinvent large portions of the transportation economy over time. A transportation ETF gives an investor a chance to go along for the ride while minimizing the risk of buying a lemon.","Transportation exchange-traded funds (ETFs) give investors exposure to a basket of stocks belonging to a broad range of companies in the transportation sector. The sector is composed of companies that build infrastructure, manufacture vehicles or other equipment, and provide services for the industry. This includes airlines, railroads, trucking, and logistics companies. Some notable companies in this sector include Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL), CSX Corp. (CSX), and General Motors Co. (GM).
Over the past year, the transportation sector has benefited from the reopening of the economy, the passage of the infrastructure bill by the U.S. Congress, and rising use of electric vehicles.

0.8,"If you're a small business owner with less than 25 employees, and your business is on a very tight budget, why not check out Payroll4Free? Payroll4Free is payroll software for small business and is 100% free, but there is a small fee if you use Payroll4Free to process and submit your payroll taxes.
Everyone likes free stuff, and small business owners are no exception. That's why Payroll4Free is a pleasant surprise.
Who wouldn't want to learn how to do payroll free? Another pleasant surprise is that the application offers a decent selection of features typically found in more expensive payroll software applications, such as an employee portal, direct deposit, and completed tax forms (which Payroll4Free will file for you for a small monthly fee).
With that being said, Payroll4Free is not for everyone.
Payroll4Free offers online payroll services for small businesses with fewer than 25 employees.
You can use Payroll4Free if you have more than 25 employees, but you will have to pay a monthly fee. With a good selection of features and online accessibility, Payroll4Free can be a great, no-cost (or low-cost) payroll application for small businesses on a tight budget.
It's also a terrific option for very small businesses just starting out.
Best used by small businesses with relatively straightforward payrolls, Payroll4Free is not your best option if you need to pay your employees multiple pay rates, or if you need to be able to run payroll from your mobile phone.
Payroll4Free remains free for up to 25 employees, with a monthly fee assessed if you exceed that number. It also charges your business a small fee ($15/month) if you opt to have Payroll4Free file and pay your payroll taxes.
You can also opt to use Payroll4Free's bank in order to fund direct deposit, though Payroll4Free notes that most of its customers choose to use their own banks for direct deposit.
You can import data from a time clock into Payroll4Free, and the application also lets you export payroll data directly to your accounting software application. Payrolls must be processed manually each pay period as there is no automatic pay option available in Payroll4Free, and the application is not able to handle employee reimbursements, nor does it offer mobile access.
The one major gripe I have with Payroll4Free has nothing to do with its features or functionality but instead is about the initial setup process, which the software completes for you.
Having Payroll4Free set up the initial application does not save you any time, and I don't like sharing a copy of an employee's W-4 with anyone, even a payroll vendor, since it contains sensitive personal identification information.
Payroll4Free uses a grid-style data-entry screen throughout the application. The grid provides a nice view of all of your employees, but there are no individual employee records available to track additional information.
There are a few other notable features in Payroll4Free.
The main reason businesses choose to use full-service payroll is for tax preparation and filing purposes. While this is an optional feature in Payroll4Free that you have to pay for, the cost is so low that there's no reason not to take advantage of it.
If you choose not to use the tax service, you will still have access to the completed forms, which you can file on your own. You will also be responsible for paying the taxes on a timely basis.
Payroll4Free lets you pay both employees and contractors, with the option to pay contractors available in the new employee setup screen. If the new hire is a contractor, you can choose to process a 1099 at year end versus a W-2, which is a nice feature, particularly for a free program.
An added bonus: If you opt to have Payroll4Free handle your payroll taxes, it will also take care of both W-2 and 1099 processing.
One of the most useful features found in Payroll4Free is the employee portal, which provides your employees with access to both current and historic pay stubs as well as year-end forms such as W-2s. The portal also lets your employees view their current vacation and sick time totals as well as make updates to their personal information.
Payroll4Free does offer good reporting options, with users able to view and print reports that detail earnings, taxes, benefits, accrued time off, and detailed payroll journal reports. Reports offer little in the way of customization capability, but they do include all of the details you need for your business.
While there is no direct integration available in Payroll4Free, you can easily export payroll data from the application into a variety of popular accounting software applications. As mentioned earlier, you can also import time clock data directly into Payroll4Free.
Aside from slow onboarding, navigation in Payroll4Free is easy. The application uses a slightly outdated interface with a small menu bar at the top of the screen and a series of tiles representing all payroll-related features. Clicking on the desired tile will take you to a grid-style entry screen where you can add employees, enter hours, and process payroll.
There is no option to run payroll automatically, so you'll have to input the hours worked each pay period, even for salaried employees. The employee grid offers a nice view of all employee details, and you have the option to pay your employees with direct deposit or by check.
Payroll4Free is free. If you choose to use the optional tax-filing service, which will file all tax-related reports and remittances for you, the cost is $15 a month -- still quite affordable.
The only other fee involved is if you need to pay more than 25 employees, but at that point, moving to a different payroll application would likely be a better idea.
A really nice feature Payroll4Free offers is its free telephone and email support, particularly in light of the fact that the application itself is available at no cost. Access to additional help resources is also available from within the application.
It may be difficult to wrap your head around the idea that a business provides payroll services free for up to 25 employees. I know it was for me.
However, slow onboarding aside, Payroll4Free truly does offer a solid payroll option at no cost, with a lot of really useful features including direct deposit, an employee portal, and the ability to import and export data to a variety of third-party software applications.
Another handy feature is the ability to outsource payroll tax processing, including remittances, to Payroll4Free, albeit at a small cost.
While Payroll4Free may not be for everyone, it's certainly worth considering, particularly for those operating on a limited budget.
The downside is that while it's nice that Payroll4Free handles product setup, that actually makes it more difficult for small business owners, as they still have to complete an employee information sheet for all employees as well as provide other legal documents to Payroll4Free.
If standard payroll services are not in your budget, Payroll4Free is definitely worth considering. It offers a good selection of features that small businesses could certainly use. Just be sure to read the rather lengthy legal disclaimer before you sign any agreements. One final word of caution: The software contains ads, which helps make it free, so be sure to take that into consideration.
Yes, it really is free payroll software. The software includes ads in the application that help to pay for it. However, if you want to use Payroll4Free's bank for direct deposit or have it process and pay payroll taxes for you, you will be charged a small fee.
Yes, you can, although you will have to be running Windows on your Mac in order to access the application.
While there is no direct integration, Payroll4Free does offer excellent import and export capabilities, so you'll be able to export payroll files to your accounting software application. You can also import data from a time clock system directly into Payroll4Free.","If payroll software simply isn’t in your budget, Payroll4Free offers all the services you’ll need to ensure your employees are paid on time and that you stay compliant with tax laws. While this free option won’t offer access to features like mobile payroll management and multiple employee rate management, it could be a great solution for a new startup or established small business not looking to exceed 25 employees. For business owners that want extra features and sleek interfaces, or have more than 25 employees, check out our list of alternatives.
Payroll4Free handles most of the setup process for you, though you will have to manually input your employees’ W-4 information. You’ll also need to establish each employee’s salary or hourly rate, as well as their current vacation time. Then, you'll set up direct deposits for each employee using your own bank (unless you opt to pay $15 per month to use Payroll4Free’s bank).
Once set up, you can integrate or export your time-clocking software data directly into Payroll4Free to make calculating paychecks quick and easy. If you are using direct deposit, your employees’ paychecks will automatically go into their bank accounts every pay period, with the necessary taxes being withheld. It is then your responsibility to report and deposit these taxes (unless you pay $15 per month for Payroll4Free to handle this). Vacation hours will be calculated as they’re taken.
If you run into any issues, Payroll4Free offers customer service support via phone or email.
No or low cost: Even if you decide to pay $15 per month to have Payroll4Free handle your taxes, it’s still an extremely affordable solution.
Easy to use: While the interface looks a bit outdated, this free software is simple to set up and use, making it ideal for companies that do not want to spend a lot of time dealing with payroll software.
Provides all essential payroll functions: You won’t get any bells or whistles with this payroll software, but you will get a solid payroll management system that does everything you need to keep your business operating smoothly.
Integrates with popular accounting software: Many small businesses use QuickBooks or other accounting platforms and Payroll4Free allows you to import data quickly with these programs.
Software only manages up to 25 employees: Although Payroll4Free can handle additional employees, you’ll pay a monthly fee for additional employees, which can make this platform less than ideal for medium to large businesses.
Limited to Windows: Payroll4Free works best on PCs, but can be used on Macs — only if they’re running Windows.
Ads: You will have ads running on your payroll software from time to time. These ads are what allow the service to remain free.
No mobile application: One of the drawbacks of this free payroll service is the lack of a mobile app to help you manage your payroll while on-the-go.
Payroll4Free has a basic free plan with a few optional upgrades. The free plan allows you to manage your payroll for no charge as long as you have 25 or fewer employees. You can use Payroll4Free if you have more than 25 employees, but you will incur a monthly payment processing fee of $35 for each group of 25 employees after the first 25.
If you would like Payroll4Free to deposit and handle your company’s payroll taxes automatically, you’ll be charged $15 per month for this service. In addition, if you choose to use Payroll4Free’s bank to handle direct deposit payroll transfers, Payroll4Free will charge you $15 per month. If you opt into both services, you’ll be charged $30 per month.
Choice of direct deposit or paper checks (you must use your own bank for the free version).
Ability to pay full-time, part-time and contract employees.
Access to automatic federal, state and local tax calculations and paperwork (you must make your own deposits and file all required forms for the free version).
Online employee portals for easy access to paystubs and W-2s.
Reporting options (earnings, benefits, payroll journal reports, etc.).
Integration with accounting, bank and time clock software.
If you’re feeling like Payroll4Free sounds too good to be true, you’re not alone. Based on Payroll4Free reviews from the Better Business Bureau (BBB), however, this service really does live up to its promises.
Better Business Bureau: 4 out of 5 stars; rated A+.
Capterra: 2.9 out of 5 stars.
G2 Crowd: 4.5 out of 5 stars.
Note that Capterra and G2 Crowd's ratings are based on a small handful of reviews. The same goes for BBB's 4-star review. The only negative BBB review discusses the long intake process, which other users have noted but found tolerable. Reviewers on Capterra mentioned that the learning curve was challenging.

You’ll receive all basic payroll functionality — direct deposit, PTO tracking, employee portals, tax withholdings and deposits, etc. — as well as options to purchase employee management and HR resources.

0.8,"Life insurance can be tricky to figure out with its complex rules and choices among competing opportunities. With the wrong information, you could end up with the wrong policy which wastes your money and doesn't properly protect your loved ones. This article will briefly examine the top 10 misconceptions surrounding life insurance to help make your road to coverage a little smoother.
Single people may need at least enough life insurance to cover their outstanding personal debts and medical and funeral bills. If you are uninsured, you may leave a legacy of unpaid expenses for your family or other loved ones to deal with. If you have enough cash to cover these expenses, whether you need life insurance depends on your future goals.
Maybe. For a single person of modest means, employer-provided term coverage may actually be enough. But if you have a spouse or other dependents, or anticipate needing additional funds upon your death to pay estate taxes, additional coverage may be necessary.
Employer-paid or employer-provided term insurance provides convenient guaranteed coverage at a low cost. However, it will only be available while you remain with your employer and it does not provide permanent coverage throughout your lifetime.4You may want a policy outside of work so you don't suddenly lose your protection after leaving your job.
For many people, this is often true. However, those with sizable assets may be better off self-insuring. When you self-insure, you use your own savings to cover your medical and funeral costs while providing for your loved ones. You save money by self-insuring as you aren't paying for the cost of setting up a policy.6 However, you might still decide to buy a policy to create a larger inheritance or as a backup in case you spend down your savings more quickly than expected.
This is not necessarily true. Term life starts out less expensive than permanent life insurance, which gives you more money to invest. However, term gets more expensive over time and can become prohibitively high in later years. Permanent policies like whole life do not increase your premium as you get older. The total premium outlay for a permanent policy may actually end up less than what you'd spend on term coverage that keeps getting more expensive over time.
Term coverage eventually ends as insurers set a maximum age limit for renewals. Those who know for certain they must be covered at death should consider some amount of permanent coverage.
Permanent life insurance also builds cash value which you can withdraw or borrow against while alive. While cash value may not grow as quickly as investing in the stock market, it's still extra savings. Ask yourself whether you would truly invest the difference after buying term or if you'd spend it. Some might prefer buying cash value life insurance as the monthly premiums essentially force you to save money over time.
In theory, the long-run investment return of a variable universal life policy (VUL) should outearn a straight universal life policy but that's not guaranteed. Your cash value growth in a VUL depends on the performance of your investments. Poor market performance may result in a a lower cash value than someone with a straight universal life policy. If you prefer to keep it safe, universal life policies with no risk of losses could be the better option.
A return-of-premium (ROP) rider might seem like an excellent deal as you get all your money back if you outlive the term of your life insurance policy. However, you need to pay more per month for this feature. Consider the opportunity cost. Do you think you'd be better off investing the extra cash or would you prefer to play it safe and get your premiums back from the ROP rider on the life insurance?
Doubtful. Perhaps by the end of your career, you'll have saved enough to cover all your needs and to provide for your family. But you take a big chance when you depend solely on your investments in the early years of your life, especially if you have dependents. If you die early in your career, chances are your investments will not be nearly enough to pay off your mortgage or to support your young children. If you want to keep as much money as possible for your investments, consider a low-cost term policy. You'll protect your loved ones while still keeping most of your money for investing.
Do you have the assets to cover your final expenses and the ongoing needs of your loved ones after you're gone? If not, you probably need a life insurance policy to cover them.
Most people with dependents need life insurance. If you're single and have enough money to cover your final medical and funeral costs, life insurance coverage may be optional.  If you have considerable savings, like at the end of your career, you could also self-insure to provide for your family rather than buying a life insurance policy.
A quick rule of thumb says you need at least ten years of your annual salary. The exact answer for most people is more complicated. Some people need more, some less, and some don't need life insurance at all.
Think of your personal situation. Are you single or married with a family? Do you have significant debts such as an outstanding mortgage? What assets do you have on hand: cash, stocks, property, and so forth? You can review the situation with a life insurance agent to determine whether you need coverage to fill gaps in your plan.
These are just some of the more prevalent misunderstandings concerning life insurance. You probably should not leave life insurance out of your budget unless you have enough assets to cover your expenses after you're gone. For more information, consult your life insurance agent or financial advisor, and be sure to do your research to determine which of the best life insurance companies is right for you.

You may have heard that it’s too expensive or only healthy people can qualify for coverage, but the truth may surprise you.
We break down six common life insurance myths so you can better understand your options and get coverage that’s right for you.
» MORE: How does life insurance work?
The payout from a life insurance policy is not affected by whether the policyholder received or did not receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Plus, applicants are not denied coverage solely based on the fact that they received the vaccine. In fact, vaccines often lead to lower mortality rates because they reduce the risk of dying from diseases.
Concerns over whether life insurance covers deaths from COVID-19 are also largely unfounded. In most cases, life insurance policies cover infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.
One of the biggest myths about life insurance is that it comes with a hefty price tag. Over half of Americans think term life insurance costs three times as much as it does, according to the 2022 Insurance Barometer Study from marketing and research firm LIMRA and life insurance-focused nonprofit Life Happens.
In reality, the average cost of life insurance can be relatively low, especially for younger generations. That’s because the younger and healthier you are, the higher your life expectancy.
Use online calculators to find out how much life insurance you need. Once you know the type of policy and coverage amount you want, be sure to compare life insurance quotes from multiple companies to get the best price. If you’re unsure of where to start, speak with a fee-only financial advisor to better understand your options.
Although your mortality may not be top of mind when you’re young, getting coverage early can help you lock in low rates. This can be useful because the price of a policy can go up as you age.
Your future insurability is another factor to consider. If you develop a health condition before you buy coverage, your access to affordable life insurance may be restricted. Features like guaranteed insurability riders will allow you to purchase more coverage in the future without a medical exam.
Although insurers typically use your health to calculate rates and coverage amounts, it doesn't mean you can’t get life insurance with a pre-existing condition. In fact, some policies are built specifically for people with certain health conditions like diabetes.
You can skip the medical exam with simplified issue life insurance. These types of policies require only a short health questionnaire. If you don’t want your medical history to be a factor, consider guaranteed issue life insurance. Acceptance is guaranteed regardless of your health — as long as you’re within the eligible age range.
Life insurance isn’t just for breadwinners. For example, if a parent, sibling or friend co-signed on your mortgage, life insurance can help them pay it off if you die.
You can also use life insurance as an inheritance for someone who doesn't rely on you financially, like a niece or nephew. Similarly, if you support a charity or nonprofit, you can assign some or all of the death benefit to the organization.
Life insurance can also offer a financial safety net to small-business owners. For example, your partners can use the payout to buy out your share in the company.
Group life insurance through an employer is typically one or two times your salary, which may not be enough to support your loved ones.
Another factor to consider is portability. Free policies through work are often tied to employment, so if you leave your job, you may lose your coverage. Buying individual life insurance means you’re covered regardless of where you work.
When speaking with a licensed agent or financial advisor, ask them to walk you through each type of life insurance. One type of life insurance isn’t necessarily better than another; it’s about what’s right for you.",investopedia,nerdwallet
0.8,,"You don’t have to choose whether to pay off student loans or buy a house. With the help of first-time home buyer programs, and if you’re able to build up enough emergency savings, you may be able to do both at the same time.
Here are three ways to decide if that’s possible for you.
For many student loan borrowers, the biggest hurdle to homebuying is coming up with a down payment. But many states offer first-time home buyer programs that will subsidize the down payment. Many lenders also offer mortgages that require far less than the traditional down payment of 20% of the home’s price.
Look into these options before despairing that it’s impossible to put tens of thousands of dollars down while paying off student loans. You may find it’s more feasible than you thought, especially when you choose a house you can afford.
At the same time, you’ll likely need to save more than you expected for items beyond the down payment. These include closing costs — which generally come to 2% to 5% of your home’s price — and home maintenance, furnishings and appliances. Plan to save 2% of your home's value per year for repairs and maintenance alone. Plus, you’ll need emergency savings left over to cover non-home expenses that might come up, like medical bills and car repairs.
Use a closing costs calculator to help you figure out how much extra to budget for. Add three months of your bare-bones expenses to that amount, and that’s how much you should plan to save in addition to the down payment.
If you feel defeated, try making a budget using the 50/30/20 plan, which encourages you to spend 50% of your income on necessities, 30% or less on wants and 20% or more on savings. That will give you a framework for saving and help you determine how long it will take.
To give yourself more flexibility to save, consider refinancing student loans, which could lower your interest rates and potentially your monthly payment. Refinancing turns multiple loans into one, at an interest rate based on your financial history. To qualify, you’ll need a credit score in the high 600s or above, solid income and a history of on-time debt payments.
Getting a lower monthly payment may mean stretching out the time it takes to pay off your loans, which could eat into your interest savings. Make sure you’re comfortable with that before refinancing in order to pay less per month.
» CALCULATE:  Should you refinance student loans?
If you can meet these goals while paying off loans, go for it. Buying a home while paying off student loans isn’t necessary, though. There’s nothing wrong with renting longer and taking more time to pay off debt. The decision, ultimately, depends on your personal homebuying timeline and how much you can save in advance.",Fool,nerdwallet
0.8,"Offering a range of life insurance products, including a guaranteed issue whole life policy, Farmers is an excellent choice for life insurance for individuals of almost all health conditions. You can also add riders to customize your policy as needed. However, you can’t get a quote without supplying personally identifying information, and you can’t apply without talking to an agent.
Life insurance through Farmers Insurance is not the same as life insurance through Farmer’s Life, which is based in Knoxville, Tennessee.
The Farmers Insurance Group of Companies (Farmers) was founded by John C. Tyler and Thomas E. Leavey as Farmers Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange in 1928. Based in Los Angeles, California, the duo started the business to sell auto insurance to rural farmers. Since then, the company has expanded beyond car insurance to home, business, life, and other insurance products. Farmers issues life insurance through Farmers New World Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary based in Bellevue, Washington. Farmers New World Life is licensed to sell life insurance in all states except New York.
For the graded benefit whole life policy, if you pass away within the first two years of coverage, your beneficiaries only receive 110% of the premiums you paid instead of the whole death benefit.
Compared to other insurance companies of its size, Farmers New World Life Insurance Company received fewer than expected customer complaints over the past three years. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) provides a complaint index for insurance companies based on the number of consumer complaints received and the company’s market share. An index of 1.00 indicates an expected number of complaints. An index under 1.00 indicates fewer complaints than expected for a company’s size, and a rating higher than 1.00 means the company received more complaints than expected.
Farmers is deemed to be financially strong by the independent insurance rating agency, AM Best, which assesses an insurer’s financial stability in order to project the company’s ability to pay claims long into the future. The financial strength of insurers is particularly critical when it comes to life insurance because buyers trust the insurer to deliver on a long-term promise.
Farmers offers several different types of life insurance.
Term life insurance is a form of insurance that guarantees the payment of a death benefit to the policy’s beneficiaries if the insured person dies before the end of a selected period. Farmers’ term policies can last for 10, 20, or 30 years and can be converted to a permanent policy. Term insurance does not have any savings component and generally provides no other value aside from the death benefit.
Whole life insurance is a type of permanent insurance that covers you for your entire life as long as you continue to pay premiums. Unlike term insurance, whole life has a cash value which accumulates tax-deferred and can be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals. Farmers offers several whole life products you can choose from.
Universal life insurance is a type of permanent insurance that offers both death benefit protection and the opportunity to build cash value that earns interest. Universal life policies are flexible. You can adjust how much you pay and how often your premiums are due, and you may be able to adjust the death benefit as well.
This policy is another type of permanent insurance. The cash value in indexed universal life insurance is linked to one or more market indexes, such as the S&P 500. If the market does well, you have the potential for growth. And since the money isn’t directly invested, your account is protected against losses if the index falls.
Variable universal life is a type of permanent insurance that lets you invest and grow the cash value through subaccounts that operate like mutual funds. Exposure to market fluctuations can generate high returns but may also result in substantial losses.
VUL is similar to variable life insurance, but unlike variable life, it allows you to change your premium payment amount.
Farmers offers a small whole life policy, which may also be referred to as a final expense policy or burial insurance. These types of policies are typically limited. With Farmers, there’s a maximum coverage amount of $30,000. This policy type is designed to cover your final expenses, such as funeral costs, medical bills, and outstanding debts (but your beneficiaries can use the funds however they need). You can get this type of policy without a medical exam.
A rider is an optional feature that you can add to your life insurance policy to customize your coverage and address additional insurance needs. Farmers offers several riders.
This option allows you to purchase additional coverage in the future without having to go through a medical exam. It's helpful if your health changes over time such that you may not qualify for additional coverage.
The child rider is an affordable way to add temporary coverage for your dependent children to your life insurance policy. When the child reaches adulthood, this rider can often be converted to a permanent policy.
This rider allows your insurance coverage to continue under certain conditions, such as if you become totally disabled and can't work to pay your premiums. It's a valuable option if you want financial protection for your family in case of an injury or illness.
This rider pays an additional death benefit if you die due to an accident. It can provide extra peace of mind if you're worried about accidental death.
Accelerated death benefits allow you to access some of your life insurance death benefit while you're still alive. However, you need to meet certain conditions in order to qualify. With the terminal illness rider, you can receive a portion of your death benefit if you have a terminal illness or injury that's expected to result in death in the near future. With Farmers, this rider is added to some policies for no additional cost.
The chronic illness rider is another accelerated death benefit that may be included on some policies from Farmers at no cost. It allows you to access your life insurance death benefit if you have a chronic, long-term illness, or injury that impacts your ability to perform at least two activities of daily living or if you suffer from a severe cognitive impairment.
Though they sound similar, chronic and critical illnesses aren't the same. A critical illness rider allows you to access your life insurance death benefit if you are diagnosed with a critical condition, such as cancer or a heart attack. This rider can help provide ongoing financial support for your family during your treatment and recovery process.
Farmers offers customer service support via phone or an online contact form on its website. Phone agents can be reached toll-free at 1-888-327-6335 from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday, with slightly shorter hours on the weekend.

Farmers Value Term lasts 10, 20 or 30 years, with premiums that stay the same throughout your chosen term. This policy is open to those between the ages of 18 and 75 but requires a medical exam. Coverage starts at $150,000, with no maximum.

Coverage starts at $15,000 and comes with a guaranteed death benefit, and premiums stay the same.

Farmers Graded Benefit Whole Life doesn’t require a medical exam. It’s marketed to people ages 18 to 80 who may have health issues but are able to take care of themselves. Premiums remain level, and policies earn a cash value over time, which Farmers guarantees. Once you’ve accumulated enough cash value, you can begin withdrawing money or taking out loans against your policy. The policy comes with a graded death benefit. This means if the policyholder dies of natural causes within the first two years, their beneficiaries will receive a payout equal to 110% of the premiums paid.
Universal life insurance. Like all universal life insurance policies, Farmers EssentialLife Universal Life offers flexible premiums, and has a cash value component that earns interest over time. The policy is open to people ages 15 days to 80 years old, with coverage starting at $50,000.
Indexed universal life insurance. Farmers Index Universal Life insurance targets people who want protection from underperforming markets. Portions of your premiums can remain in a short-term holding account earning 0.1%, be allocated to accounts indexed to the S&P 500 or S&P MARC 5% ER or placed in a fixed interest account paying a guaranteed minimum interest rate of 1%.
Over three years, Farmers has drawn close to the expected number of complaints to state regulators for a company of its size, according to a NerdWallet analysis of data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
The Farmers website has clear descriptions of each life insurance product and several resources for shoppers, including guidance determining which type of life insurance is right for them. You can log in to manage your policy and make payments.

0.7931034483,"Perhaps you've read our accounting software reviews but remain confused about which of these two, popular accounting tools is right for you.
To make the decision a little easier, we're comparing Xero and QuickBooks Online, side by side based on features, pricing, ease of use, and more.
Xero is an excellent accounting software option for startups and small business owners, and it’s particularly well suited for business owners who know absolutely nothing about accounting but still need to properly manage their finances.
The Xero accounting interface is clean and uncluttered, and new users have access to a demo company where they can manipulate data without worrying about entering or deleting important information.
QuickBooks Online, an offshoot of the popular QuickBooks Desktop application, is a good fit for small and growing businesses.
Originally designed for very small businesses, when compared to the desktop version, QuickBooks Online now offers growing businesses the option to use an application they won’t outgrow in a short amount of time.
Xero and QuickBooks Online both offer a ton of features all designed for small business owners.
While the vocabulary may vary between the two products, they both offer electronic banking, excellent invoicing, payment acceptance, and bill management capabilities.
Xero places its features into five main categories: Dashboard, Business, Accounting, Projects, and Contacts. Xero’s accounting dashboard offers a nice summary of your business, including bank balances, invoices owed, and total cash in and out of your business, with the dashboard completely customizable.
The Business category is where you’ll find invoicing, bills to pay, purchase orders, and products and services. The invoices option in Xero displays a nice summary view of all invoices and their current status.
Xero’s invoice entry screen, seen above, is clean and uncluttered with easy look-up options available for most fields. Once the invoice is completed, you can send it via email with online bill payment options included in the email. Once payment is received, Xero will automatically apply the payment if paid online, or you can process the payment during your regular bank reconciliation process.
The Accounting category in Xero is where you’ll handle all of your banking transactions, as well as manage your chart of accounts and financial statements. The Projects category lets you manage any projects and record time spent using the time tracking feature.
The Contacts category lets you manage all contacts, from customers to suppliers to contractors, from one location. Reporting in Xero is solid, with a variety of financial statements and management reports available.
A mobile app for both iOS and Android devices is available in Xero, offering the ability to handle common tasks such as receipt management, contact management, bank reconciliation, and invoice creation.
Like Xero, QuickBooks Online offers standard features like electronic banking, solid invoicing capability, bill management, and payment acceptance, but it breaks them down into more specific categories rather than lumping them together into one category.
User preference can play a role in which style you prefer, but generally, the more self-explanatory a central navigation screen is, the easier it is for new users to find their way around.
Entering an invoice in QuickBooks Online is simple, and it offers the ability to add a credit card or bank account number to a customer’s account – a nice feature that allows you to immediately process an online payment for that customer.
QuickBooks Online also gives you the option to have customer payments applied automatically once they’re deposited, or leave that option to the user. The Expense category lets you add vendor invoices and get them ready for payment, and QuickBooks Online lets you manage customers, vendors, and employees in the system, with a payroll option available through Intuit.
The Report Center in QuickBooks Online offers a central location to process reports, which include all standard financial statements as well as a healthy selection of management reports.
This one is a tie. Xero and QuickBooks Online offer very similar features and functionality along with summary dashboards to measure business health.
You tried importing data, but it’s not showing up. You’ve entered a transaction, but it won’t post. The product won’t let you log in. All of these things can cause extreme frustration, and you'll need the assistance of product support to solve these problems.
While both of these accounting tools offer a ton of help articles, knowledge bases, and robust user communities, who will win in the Xero, QuickBooks Online comparison in the battle of support personnel?
Xero's accounting functionalities are fairly simple to navigate, so it’s likely these resources will be sufficient if and when something goes wrong.
You'll rarely be asking yourself how to use QuickBooks Online as they offer plenty of guidance throughout the application; users can click on the question mark anytime they need assistance.
The winner here is QuickBooks Online. Live support will always beat chat or text support. You may never need to call support, but it’s nice to know it’s an option.
An important though often overlooked component of any software product is how easy it is to use.
That’s one of the most important reasons for downloading a demo (if possible) of any accounting application in which you may be interested, because preferences differ, and something I like may be something you absolutely hate.
For those who like everything in neat compartments, Xero may be your best option. Instead of the “add what you need” process many other accounting software applications employ, Xero requires you to set up your business completely before you can start using the software.
If you just want to get started and add things as you go, Xero may not be for you.
Xero’s main entry screen uses a menu bar at the top of the screen for access to system functions. This pared-down menu makes it easy for new users to find their way around the application without too much trouble.
Help is accessible from any data-entry screen, and a demo company is available for those who want to enter practice transactions without worrying about messing up their own data.
For those on the go, Xero has a mobile app accounting tool for both iOS and Android devices, though the app does not give you access to all of the features found in the full version. You can import data such as customers into Xero, but you’ll have to download the CSV file template in Xero in order to import the data correctly.
The QuickBooks Online setup is designed to be, well, quick. You can enter as much or as little information as you need, and simply add the rest when it’s necessary.
One of the things I like about this Xero alternative is the fact that you can place your cursor over one of the categories listed in the vertical menu to see what features are available in that category.
For those moving their small business' accounting over from another application, you can import data into QuickBooks Online using the Import Data function.
The QuickBooks Online accounting dashboard provides much of the same information that’s included in Xero’s dashboard, but it also provides quick links to tasks such as invoicing, time tracking, and payroll.
The edge goes to Xero for ease of use. Its data-entry screens are more minimalist than those of QuickBooks Online, and its invoice and billing entries require less in the way of data entry. However, QuickBooks Online edges out Xero for dashboard features.
Pricing levels for Xero and QuickBooks Online are very similar, with both applications offering three pricing plans. For example, both mid-level plans are similar in price and scope, with the Growing plan in Xero costing you $32, while QuickBooks Online’s Plus plan is $35.
A 50% discount will be applied to the above prices for the first two months.
Xero’s Early plan offers limited capability (send five invoices, enter five bills, reconcile limited bank transactions), while the Growing plan includes unlimited invoicing and bill processing, along with unlimited bank transactions.
Features found only in the Established plan include multicurrency capability, project tracking, and expense management capability.
A 50% discount will be applied to the above prices for the first three months.
All QuickBooks Online plans include income and expense tracking, invoicing, payment acceptance, estimates, sales tax tracking, and receipt organization.
Moving up to the more expensive plans will get you features such as inventory, custom user permissions, and accelerated invoicing, with all plans providing the basic functionality your business needs.
QuickBooks Online is the winner, here. While Xero might be a good application to start with, growing businesses will appreciate the scalability offered by QuickBooks Online.
Yes, QuickBooks' accounting tools do come in a little higher in overall pricing, but the plan options are more flexible and offer more features than Xero’s plans.
The ability to integrate a software product with other applications can increase its functionality tremendously. Both Xero and QuickBooks Online offer excellent integration with hundreds of apps.
Xero offers integration with more than 700 apps in a variety of categories, including payment acceptance apps such as Stripe, PayPal, and GoCardless, as well as CRM, inventory, payroll, point of dale, e-commerce, and time tracking applications.
QuickBooks Online offers integration with hundreds of apps, making it great for small business owners. These integrations including PayPal, TSheets, Bill Pay for QuickBooks Online, and Stripe, with apps available for inventory, payroll, CRM, and time tracking.
Xero is the winner in this category, offering more than 700 apps that can connect with its core application.
One of the major differences between Xero and QuickBooks Online is the setup process.
Xero's accounting functions use a very structured setup process that requires eight distinct steps, whereas QuickBooks Online allows users to enter only the bare minimum and get started quickly, adding additional details when they become necessary.
While this, again, can come down to user preference, I like the ability to just jump in and get started.
Xero uses a very structured setup process, which is great for those who like to have everything in place prior to starting work.
QuickBooks Online's accounting software has a looser setup structure, allowing you to enter the bare minimum and add the rest as you go along.
QuickBooks Online is the setup winner for me, but you more organized folks may disagree.
QuickBooks Online by a nose, a very small nose. While there are some distinct benefits found in this QuickBooks' competitor, their offers the one thing Xero does not: live support.
I have learned never to underestimate the importance of live product support, particularly when it comes to managing my money. Another benefit is that QuickBooks Online is better for small businesses, as you're able to scale with your growing company.","Xero and QuickBooks Online are both powerful accounting software solutions for small businesses. However, when you compare features, QuickBooks Online inches ahead for its stronger feature set, ease of sharing with accountants and customer support.
This doesn't mean QuickBooks Online is the right choice for all businesses, though. Xero's unlimited-users feature makes it a winner among larger businesses and well-established small businesses that require more than five users. It’s also less expensive than QuickBooks Online and a bit easier to use, thanks to its customizable dashboard and simple layout.
Has robust reporting tools and report customization options, basic inventory tracking in all plans and a capable mobile app; Early plan limits the number of invoices and bills.

All QuickBooks Online plans support unlimited invoices. Xero’s Early plan, recommended for self-employed people or brand-new businesses, allows 20 invoices per year. If you only send out an invoice or two each month, the Early plan is an affordable option at $13 per month. Otherwise, you’ll have to bump up your subscription or consider QuickBooks Online plans.
QuickBooks Online allows users to claim expenses and match them to photos of receipts in all plans, whereas Xero requires Xero Expenses, an additional feature only included in the highest-tier Established plan. If snapping photos of receipts to claim expenses on the go is a key mobile feature you’d like to have, regardless of plan level, QuickBooks Online might be a better fit.
Both Xero and QuickBooks Online have their own versions of transaction tracking tags, but QuickBooks Online is the winner in this arena. Xero lets users create two active tracking categories, while QuickBooks Online allows users to create 40 in the Simple Start, Essentials and Plus plans. QuickBooks Online’s Advanced plan allows for unlimited tag groups. The more categories you create, the more reports you can run to get a better idea of how your business functions and where there's room to grow.
Both accounting software products let users invite their accountants by email. The process shouldn’t take more than a couple of minutes. If you’re located in the United States, though, there’s a better chance your accountant is familiar with QuickBooks Online than Xero. QuickBooks Online is an industry standard with more than 5 million users worldwide. If you count QuickBooks Desktop users, that number rises to 8 million. With more than 3 million users worldwide, Xero is popular but not as ubiquitous as QuickBooks Online.
Business owners who prefer working through a hiccup on the phone will favor QuickBooks Online. The company offers phone support Monday through Friday from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT and Saturday to Sunday from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. PT. Advanced plan subscribers get 24/7 customer support. Xero doesn’t provide customers with a phone number but will call you if you provide your contact info.
If you need to give accounting access to more than five people, Xero could be the better option for you. QuickBooks Online’s most popular Plus plan tops out at five users; its highest-tier Advanced plan allows up to 25 users, but that plan is expensive at $200 per month. In contrast, all Xero plans offer unlimited users and its highest-tier Established plan is a more affordable $70 per month.
Xero is known for having a simple, sleek layout that could feel more approachable to business owners who are new to accounting basics or don't have the background knowledge to leverage QuickBooks Online's full functionality. You can do a lot with QuickBooks Online, but all the options may feel like information overload starting out.
If you can’t justify the $90-per-month QuickBooks Online Plus plan, you won't get inventory management, because QuickBooks Online's lower-tier plans don’t come with it. This could be a real shortcoming for small online retail businesses, for instance, that need to keep track of their products and the materials used to make them. All of Xero’s plans come with inventory management so business owners can track what’s in stock and which products are selling.
Just keep in mind that unlike the inventory feature in QuickBooks Online’s higher-tier plans, Xero doesn’t let users set up reorder points that flag when stock is running low.
Wave Accounting is a free accounting solution for very small service-based businesses, contractors, freelancers and consultants. If you can’t justify paying for QuickBooks Online or Xero or they have too many features your business doesn’t need, Wave might be an ideal alternative. It has comparable invoicing features, but lacks an audit trail and doesn’t integrate with third-party apps.
With a free plan and paid plans starting at $20 per month, Zoho Books has plans for most budgets. Higher-tier plans include unique features, like workflow rules, on top of tools that help you measure project profitability. Phone support and live chat support are available 24/5 to all paying customers, but third-party integrations are limited compared to QuickBooks Online and Xero.
Pricing: $17 per month and up.
FreshBooks can be a good option for freelancers and contractors looking for an affordable, simple accounting software. There’s time tracking in all plans and phone support is available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET. Monday through Friday. The first two plan tiers put a limit on billable clients, but not on invoices.",Fool,nerdwallet
