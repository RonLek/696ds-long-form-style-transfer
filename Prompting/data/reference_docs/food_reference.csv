We'e a big fan of Anton's—but we're particularly in love with the West Village restaurant this month, given its latest promotion: 25 cent martinis and manhattans all month long. We'll drink to that!
Yes, we know it's Dry January... but can you resist such a price tag? Just to be extra clear: the downtown spot will be serving full-sized cocktails for a quarter of a dollar during its lunch service every weekday through January 31. See you there?
Alas, if you're sticking to your dry January resolution, we applaud you and are here to help. Check out these five cocktails that we made with zero-proof spirits from local shop Spirited Away, a new downtown destination that might actually convince you to forego alcohol all together.
Whether you're having alcohol or not this month, congratulations on (almost!) making it through one of the most depressing months of the year!"
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/a-mini-japanese-marketplace-is-opening-in-brooklyn-090722,Timeout,"Make your own dashi packs, buy some ceramics, and try a nine-course omakase tasting menu.
Soon, you’ll be able to experience the tastes of Japan without ever leaving Brooklyn.
When 50 Norman opens in Greenpoint on Friday, September 16, it’ll bring a Japanese multi-retail and dining mini-complex to the neighborhood.
Acclaimed Japanese architect Jo Nagasaka designed the 3,500-square-foot space featuring reclaimed woods from demolished old houses in Kyoto as a way to bring the essence of Japan to Brooklyn. 50 Norman will house three well-respected brands from Tokyo making their debut in New York.
Up your home design with ceramics, kitchenware, zen meditation items, and art pieces at Cibone (that’s pronounced Cee-Bo-Nay). The shop promises lifestyle and artisanal goods that represent classic and contemporary Japanese craftsmanship. Cibone will highlight items that are not mechanically mass-produced, but instead edited and archived by the team, born from the mind of an artist or by craftspeople conveying the traditions of Japan.
Dubbing itself as The Natural Broth Shop, Dashi Okume is the only specialty shop in the U.S. where you can custom order your own blends of dashi packs. You’ll be able to choose from a combination of ingredients from around 30 choices. Dashi Okume also carries retail products such as ready-made dashi packs, frozen dried fish, and dashi soy-sauce kits, alongside a casual dining experience serving comforting Japanese meals.
Debuting about a month after its counterparts, mark your calendar for House Brooklyn’s opening in late October. This eight-seat Japanese French restaurant by Kyoto native Chef Yuji Tani will offer delicate yet innovative Japanese French cuisine served as a nine-course omakase tasting menu. Chizuko Niikawa of Sake Discoveries has prepared a sake list, Brooklyn restaurant Four Horsemen is handling the wine list, and the tea pros at Kettl are curating a tea list."

Following successful runs in Madrid, Milan, Paris and Rome, the Balloon Museum has taken over Pier 36 in The Seaport.
Set in and outside of the 80,000-square-foot space, the new cultural destination debuted on October 27 with a new exhibit titled “Let’s Fly,” scheduled to run through January 14, 2024.
Expect a variety of installations created by 18 different international artists and media studios to be on display, each one pertaining to the importance of modern art and exploring the nature of inflatables. Visitors are encouraged to interact with the art, touching and feeling the various pieces exhibited. Basically, the exact opposite of the “don’t touch the art” mantra that dominates trips to more traditional museums.
Among the showcased artists will be muralist Camila Falsini, Sasha Frolova (she's the one responsible for the inflatable latex sculptures you won't stop staring at) and Cyril Lancelin, among others.
In terms of actual pieces, you can expect a 4,000-square-foot ball pit, inflatable lava lamps and the sorts of infinity rooms that you'll itch to post about on Instagram.
It will take you about 90 minutes to do the entire experience, which includes stops at different rooms and the occasional use of VR sets.
One more thing: after looking through the pictures, the pop-up experience may seem a bit familiar—that’s because the destination made an appearance on the last season of Netflix’s hit TV show Emily in Paris.
Tickets for the show are available right here starting at $41."
https://www.timeout.com/usa/news/these-are-the-cheapest-luxury-hotels-in-every-state-120822,Timeout,"Yes, it’s a contradiction but we just want champagne upon check-in.
Is it a paradox wrapped in an enigma to say that we want to stay in a luxury hotel, but we want it to be inexpensive?
According to CashNetUSA, many factors have made it easier for people without a gold card to access stays in four and five star hotels. Luxury is more in reach—and upscale rooms can be had for under $200. And there’s now a helpful list of the cheapest one-night stays in a five-star hotel in each of the 50 states, as well as 10 bonus big cities. Sounds like a fun way to build a road trip! Before we get to the nitty-gritty of the list, here are some of the interesting takeaways.
The cheapest luxury hotel in the US, coming in at a mere $73, is the four-star DoubleTree by Hilton Deadwood at Cadillac Jack’s in South Dakota. Phew! Based on that name, bring your ammo. The cheapest luxury hotel in a big city is the five-star Signia San Jose in California, where you can snag a fancy room for $309. The list is pretty eye-opening: we see a Ritz Carlton and a few Four Seasons locations on the list, many DoubleTree chains, and a dotting of singular hotels like The Breakwater Inn and Spa in Kennebunkport, ME (four stars, $218) and the Topnotch Resort in Stowe, VT (four stars, $350).
Some states, alas, do not have five-star hotels (including, gasp, Connecticut), and so four-stars pad out the list. On the other end of the spectrum, Wyoming’s cheapest luxury lodging was quite expensive—check out (since you may not be able to check in) the Four Seasons Resort Jackson Hotel at (cough) $2,805.
If you’re looking at the bright lights of Vegas, the five-star ARIA Resort & Casino comes in at $179, and if you’re curious about Hawaii’s deals, the five-star Fairmont Orchid Gold Experience is $909. So there’s a lot of fluidity in these prices!
As for that fantasy road trip, hitting each hotel on the list, you’d only need $17,581 to be pampered until it (pleasantly) hurts—and interesting, the best route between the hotels is 17,476 miles… so your miles and dollars are about the same. But of course, gas will set you back.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/new-years-eve-dinner-in-nyc,Timeout,"Toast to 2024 with these NYC New Year’s Eve prix fixe menus, à la carte options, open bars and all-night parties.
Don’t start 2024 cleaning up your kitchen! Whether you want to dine at one of NYC’s best restaurants before you hit a fabulous New Year’s Eve party or have a slice of pizza and a cocktail before falling asleep on the couch at 11pm, these prix fixe and à la carte options make for a memorable last meal of 2023. Feast on a mini buffet and an open bar a few minutes from the Times Square ball drop, put on your finest gown for a New Year’s Eve gala or stay local (and stay in your sweatpants)—these are the very best restaurants open on New Year’s Eve 2023 in NYC.
One of the very best special-occasion restaurants in Brooklyn is hosting a prix fixe dinner for New Year’s Eve. Festive canapés, root veggies with black truffle stracciatella, shrimp and grits with XO sauce and roasted Vermont lamb are featured on the four-course menu, with an optional wine pairing for an additional $85. They’re known for their baked Alaska, but a caramelized white chocolate mousse is another toasty way to toast the new year. Dinner is $175/pp, reservations available here.
Feel like ditching the prix fixe menus and getting a satisfying slice of tavern-style pizza, instead? Emmett’s is serving up celebratory appetizer towers stacked with pigs-in-blankets, meatball sliders, crispy fried olives and chicken parm along with their sharable pies. It’s way more laid-back than some of the other New Year’s Eve dinner destinations, so you can wear the same outfit you’ll rock on your couch while you watch When Harry Met Sally and fall asleep to the dulcet tones of Anderson Cooper. Price à la carte, reservations available here.
This Greek restaurant and “semi-private club” is always a little bit extra (like, they put gold leaf on tuna tartare), and this New Year’s Eve, they’re really taking it over the top. They’ve combined dinner and a party into one NYE extravaganza, with a caviar-heavy prix fixe menu and an appearance by their signature bespoke, interactive cocktail cart. If you’ve got an outfit that’s just begging to get seen, this is where you want to be at midnight. Dinner is $200/pp, reservations available here.
This 10,500 square-foot restaurant is about as Times Square as you can get (notwithstanding the iconic New Year’s Eve ball, of course). This year, Pink Taco will be hosting a NYE party with a “mini buffet” for those who want to be in Times Square but don’t want to have to wear an adult diaper while standing in the freezing cold. Tickets include a five hour open bar, so make sure to fill up on food during those early evening hours. Tickets start at $99, available here.
Ring in the New Year en français with foie gras mousse, panisse with meyer lemon, trout rillette and halibut with sauce américaine. This seasonal four-course prix fixe has an optional wine pairing, but you don’t want to miss their extensive list of Champagne. If you’re feeling super celebratory, a magnum is certainly the biggest (if not necessarily the best, depending on how you handle your hangovers) way to toast to 2024. Dinner is $165/pp, reservations available here.
Celebrate the beginning of 2024 with buckets of beautifully crispy fried chicken, flaky buttermilk biscuits served with seasonal jams, creamy coleslaw and—perhaps most importantly—1.5 hours of all the prosecco you can drink. For dessert, you’ll get to choose a slice of Bubby’s pie, which will surely pair beautifully with your fourth or fifth glass of bubbly. Dinner is $65/pp, reservations available here.
Don’t want to go into Manhattan to celebrate? We get it. This casual red sauce spot serves the neighborhood crowd—AKA the folks who have to get home to the sitter. Order the spaghetti pomodoro and the eggplant parm for a homey, satisfying send off to 2023. A classic cocktail or hearty pour of Chianti is plenty celebratory, and a tiramisu with two spoons is sometimes exactly what you need. Price à la carte, reservations available here.
Add a little uptown elegance to your evening at this black tie dinner. (If you’re doing the girl math on that dress you’ve only worn once, then wearing it again actually makes this dinner a bargain.) Their first seating, from 5 to 8pm, is a three-course prix fixe with lobster bisque, foie gras, dover sole and other fancy-to-fussy delights. Their second seating is a full New Year’s Eve gala, complete with Kristal caviar, a truffle course, a dessert tasting and a night of dancing in the Art Deco lobby. Dinner starts at $170/pp, reservations available here.
This scene-y spot (co-owned by Robert De Niro, no less) is offering up a New Year’s Eve prix fixe to celebrate another year in the history books. Tuna carpaccio, steak tartare, pumpkin agnolotti and duck cannelloni are featured on this play-the-hits menu, with Wagyu and black truffle polenta fries available for an upcharge. It’s glamorous and celebratory, but not too over-the-top, hitting the sweet spot for a night to remember. Dinner is $165, make a reservation here.
The hands-down winner of “most courses in the NYE prix fixe” is Phillipe Chow, where they’re offering up 16 courses (including but not limited to steamed dumplings, chicken satay, spring rolls, Chilean sea bass, kung pao chicken, lobster, peking duck, tableside cotton candy baked Alaska and a warm chocolate lava cake) worth of Beijing-style items. If you’re feeling bubbly, you can upgrade your dinner with a bottle of Perrier-Jouët Grand Brut. Dinner starts at $175/pp, reservations available here."

A new fine-dining restaurant has opened in the Bay Area and it's exclusively for dogs. Yes, your hungry hound can enjoy bespoke meal plans tailored for your dogs’ age, weight, activity level, special needs and allergies.
Operated by Rahmi Massarweh and his wife Alejandra, Dogue offers only the finest and freshest ingredients for your canine companion. Rahmi explains on the website that he was formally a professional chef trained in classic French cuisine in San Francisco. The couple owned four dogs and inevitably soon found that their beloved pets were a bit picky. Before long, he was making fresh, healthy food for them... and not too long after that, they opened up what could very well be the first eatery in the US to serve a tasting menu exclusively for dogs.
Located in San Francisco’s Mission District (because where else would it be?) Dogue offers carefully crafted pastries from its in-house 'pawtisserie' and French-themed courses made with locally sourced, organic ingredients. A dog's dinner this is not.
During the week, the doggy diner serves Parisian pastries and 'dogguccinos' that start at $4.95. A $75 three-course meal, which is seasonal and frequently rotates, is served for Sunday walk-ins only. Pet owners can choose from a variety of dishes to serve their four-legged friends, such as green-lipped mussels with fermented carrots and wheatgrass or organic beef chuck steak with fermented carrots and beets or even squid tentacles and ink.
As the Instagram account for the extraordinary eatery explains, 'Squid contains riboflavin, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin E, and several antioxidants, which might fight free radicals in your dog's body and reduce their risk of cell damage and infection from viruses and pathogens. It contains many vitamins and minerals, including zinc, copper, and B vitamins. It’s also a great source of protein and is low in fat,"" and so on.
Barking mad? Since its opening, the restaurant has received impassioned reaction from both critics and enthusiasts. On social media, people quickly labeled it as an 'only in San Francisco' story. Perhaps they're just barking up the wrong tree."

After debuting its Espresso Martini Fest in Australia in 2016 and then bringing it to London, Mr. Black, the premium coffee liquor, is bringing the festival to selected cities across the US, and NYC is one of them luckily.
For a whole week, from May 16 through May 22, participating bars across the city will be offering $12 espresso martinis, and patrons who RSVP to the fest will be able to admire and taste different bartenders' takes on the iconic drink.
Famous cocktail venues will participate in the festival, like East Village local favorites Mister Paradise and Pretty Ricky's and Greenwich Village's beloved Dante. Brooklynites, instead, will be able to flock to Williamsburg's recent addition Thief and Hole in the Wall, among others, to sip on some caffeinated drinks.
Espresso martinis have been circulating in bars worldwide for years, but they're having something of a moment in the US.
""The Espresso Martini is a genuine modern classic cocktail. It's been consistently popular around the world for 10 years, and it's great to see the US having its coffee cocktail renaissance in 2022,"" Tom Baker, Founder of Mr. Black, said in a statement. ""Until we created Mr. Black in 2013, coffee was all but forgotten in the liquor industry—and now here we are working with some of the best bars in the US to showcase that very thing.""
New Yorkers will also be able to get a sneak peek of how the perfect espresso martini comes to life. Bea Bradsell, cocktail expert and daughter of the creator of the espresso martini, Dick Bradsell, will hold an exclusive masterclass in NYC at Little Ways on May 17. To RSVP, you can visit this link.
And to keep the espresso martini party going, Mr. Black has also partnered with Dante for a special (and free!) Espresso Martini Fest event. Featuring some of the city's top bartenders like Channing Centeno from Bonnie's, Sam Casuga of Temple Bar, Leanne Favre of Clover Club, and Adam Montgomery from Hawksmoor, the event will take place at Dante's new Seaport location. To participate, guests only need to RSVP here. They will receive a complimentary espresso martini upon arrival and will be able to purchase $12 espresso martinis throughout the night.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/taco-bell-menu-change-august-2020-removing-items,Thrillist,"At this point, it's safe to say that 2020... has, well, not been what we expected. And as if we weren't dealing with enough uncertainty, Taco Bell is throwing another curve ball our way. The chain announced Friday that it's officially cutting several items from its nationwide menu next month -- just days after the information was leaked by employees on Reddit.
""Beginning August 13, we will be simplifying our menu to streamline operations,"" Taco Bell stated in a press release. ""This evolved menu approach comes after months of analyzing the new way we are running our restaurants. With safety top of mind, we want to ensure an easy and fast ordering experience for our guests and team members.""
T-Bell provided the following list of 13 menu items it's ""saying goodbye to"" when the menu change goes into effect: Grilled Steak Soft Taco, 7-Layer Burrito, Nachos Supreme, Beefy Fritos Burrito, Spicy Tostada, Triple Layer Nachos, Spicy Potato Soft Taco, Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes, Cheesy Potato Loaded Griller, Beefy Nacho Loaded Griller, Mini Skillet Bowl (breakfast), and\ two of its Chips & Dips (Chips and Guacamole and Chips and Pico De Gallo). While the Quesarito was rumored to be getting the axe as well, it turns out you'll still be able to get it if you order via the Taco Bell mobile app or the chain's website.
When reached by Thrillist, a spokesperson for the chain confirmed that the beloved potato ingredient will be completely removed from the menu.
Word of the cuts emerged on Reddit this week, including a post shared by a ""verified"" employee. At the time, Taco Bell wouldn't confirm the information, but several other posts to the /r/LivingMas and /r/TacoBell subreddits backed up the claims. The internet understandably was in full-on outrage mode (myself included).
It's worth pointing out that some fans on the /r/TacoBell subreddit said they can understand why Taco Bell would make cuts right now, considering we're in the middle of a pandemic, employees are likely stressed, and other related factors. The company says as much in a further explanation for the menu slashes.
""As we move forward, we will continue to lean into learnings from our restaurants to strive for a Taco Bell experience that is safe, fast, and efficient for all,"" Taco Bell said, per the press release.
Of course, this isn't the first time Taco Bell has done us dirty. Back in 2019, the Mexican-style fast food joint dropped nine menu items, including the double decker taco and the Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Taco (RIP). If you missed the chance to eat the items that were cut last time, don't make the same mistake this time.
""We encourage fans to snag the [discontinued] menu items over the next few weeks before discovering new favorites,"" Taco Bell said."

An absolute necessity and yet the object of everyone's scorn, the New York City subway system is an emblem of the town we call ours. It should come as no surprise, then, that New Yorkers have very strong opinions about the infrastructure.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) just released the findings of its spring 2022 bi-annual customer satisfaction and travel survey, which was issued back in June to 175,000 subway riders and 47,000 bus users. Although some respondents praised certain lines over others, one thing rang true across the board: everyone has something to say about the subway system.
Overall, according to the survey, subway satisfaction rates approach 48% (read: less than half of riders are okay with how the system is working). Those rates jump to 63% when analyzing bus ridership, with express bus customers indicating a 76% satisfaction rate.
When looking at specific subway lines, the L, G, Q and 7 topped the list of most appreciated routes‚ with the L train earning the top spot with—surprise, surprise—a pretty low 53% satisfaction rating (these are the sorts of numbers we're working with).
On the other side of the spectrum, the D train was crowned the least loved line, with a 40% satisfaction rate. The A, C and E lines are not particularly popular either—only 41% of respondents indicated their appreciation for it.
What all these statistics say to us is that, alas, the city needs to completely revamp its transportation system—a suggestion residents have been making for years. Will that ever happen within our lifetime? Probably not, despite a new station potentially opening in Hell's Kitchen and the recent installment of a new tap-and-go payment method across all stops.
Let's rejoice, though, at the upcoming overhaul of Penn Station (which, unfortunately, still falls short of the immense updates that the transit hub is in dire need of)."

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/who-doesnt-want-this-bucket-of-mcdonalds-mcnuggets-and-fried-cheese,Thrillist,"Sure, McDonald's might want you to think it can offer semi-healthy food options instead of its typical burgers and fries, but one of the company's newest -- and more gluttonous -- menu items appears to embrace its greasy, deep-fried history. It's literally a big tub of fried chicken and cheese.
As reported by Burger Business, the global fast food chain's Austrian restaurants are serving what's called the ""McDonald's Schmankerl Mix,"" which is German for ""tons of calories"" (not true). Actually, it's a KFC-style cardboard bucket filled with 15 Chicken McNuggets, 10 fried Emmentaler cheese puffs shaped like hearts (because everyone <3s cheese?), and a choice of four sauces. Totaling nearly 1,500 calories and a whopping 80g of fat, this thing shouldn't be eaten alone or in one sitting, but that doesn't make it any less tempting.
Luckily/sadly/frustratingly/ugh, the mini barrel of cholesterol isn't available here in the US, and appears to be exclusive to Austria. So besides the obvious questions like ""What the hell is a Schmankerl?"" and ""Are heart-shaped fried cheese balls a cruel joke?"", the bucket further fuels the question of, ""Why in the world does McDonald's release thebeststuffin other countries?""
Tony Merevick is Cities News Editor at Thrillist and is intrigued by the aforementioned fried cheese, because he loves cheese. Send news tips to news@thrillist.com and follow him on Twitter @tonymerevick."

https://www.eater.com/22713107/spencer-pratt-taco-bell-uber-eats-amethyst-crystal-mercury-in-retrograde-nachos,Eater,"This story has everything: Taco Bell, Uber Eats, Spencer Pratt, an amethyst shaped like a tortilla chip...
This, like most fast-food restaurant promotions, is arbitrary nonsense — like inventing a new food holiday or the term “fourth meal.” Taco Bell is wisely capitalizing on the increased interest in astrology and metaphysical healing by partnering with Pratt, known crystal enthusiast, who once said, “I’m trying to keep it in my crystals...I know they’re not working, that’s why there is hundreds on me right now” in a now-iconic episode of The Hills.
But there is a hook here: Mercury is in retrograde through October 18, 2021. Astronomically, that just means Mercury appears like it’s moving backwards from Earth’s perspective. Astrologically, though, it’s shorthand for all sorts of communication problems, be they interpersonal or society-wide. Could Mercury be responsible for Facebook going offline for a day? Who’s to say! It’s a better explanation than anything they’ve come up with!
Cosmically, though, I think I can make this make sense. [Editor’s note: Jaya literally wrote the book on crystals and is in fact our in-house expert.] Amethyst is a stone primarily of balance. Its name comes from the ancient Greek amethystos, meaning “not drunk.” As Pliny the Elder wrote in Natural History, “The falsehoods of the magicians would persuade us that these stones are preventive of inebriety,” and that “if we inscribe the names of the sun and moon upon this stone, and then wear it suspended from the neck, with some hair of [a baboon] and feathers of the swallow, it will act as a preservative against all noxious spells.” The Taco Bell amethyst does not come with hair of baboon nor feather of swallow, but it does come on a necklace, with a drip of gold that feels like the name of the sun, so protection there is! If Mercury in retrograde is a time of great unbalance, the sobering and protecting powers of amethyst make it a fitting stone for Taco Bell and Pratt to shill.
Chef Jeremy Chan and Iré Hassan-Odukale run one of London's hottest restaurants. Watch as they process their aged beef and turn it into the foundation of Michelin-starred Ikoyi's menu, which also offers items like aged sirloin topped with caviar, moin moin-inspired dumplings, plantain, and more.
Also, consider the shape of the nacho-thyst: A triangle, the sturdiest, most balanced shape of all geometry, serving to further concentrate and solidify amethyst’s balancing powers. This is replicated in the nachos themselves, which are both composed of many triangle chips and layered with sour cream, cheese, and ground beef in, dare I say, a delicate flavor balance? And that the RetroGrande Nachos are free with a $12 purchase...1+2=3, the number of sides of a triangle, the number which in numerology represents a person who is skilled at communication, the precise area Mercury in retrograde is said to affect! Wheels within wheels people! It’s all happening.
As a member of the press looking to do my due diligence to journalism AND mysticism,  I requested the Taco Bell amethyst ten days ago and it still has not arrived for me to see how balancing it is for myself. What I do feel confident in, however, is that Taco Bell certainly thought about everything detailed above (the symbolism of amethyst, the numerology, etc.) and didn’t just jump on the flimsy pun “RetroGrande.” Anyway, I hope my crystal arrives soon and I’m looking forward to figuring out which of my chakras is aligned with nachos."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/watch-full-lunar-eclipse-nyc-november,Thrillist,"New Yorkers who enjoy early mornings (or very late nights, depending on when you go to bed) will get a special celestial treat on Tuesday.
A gorgeous blood moon is set to take over the skies, and NYC residents will be able to marvel at the lunar eclipse with the naked eye on November 8. It will be the second time this year that a lunar eclipse blesses the night sky, and this time, it will paint the moon red, hence the ""bloody"" nickname.
A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth, and moon fall into alignment. The November 8 phenomenon will begin just past 3 am, but it won't be until 5:16 am that it will reach the status of a full lunar eclipse. New Yorkers looking to enjoy the beautiful show will have a three hour window to take advantage of it, and while binoculars aren't needed, they are encouraged for a better viewing experience.
During tomorrow's eclipse, Mars and the Pleiades star cluster will also be visible. While Mars will be reddish in color (and it will look like a bigger star than the others), the cluster will light up the sky with thousands of bright stars. Just like the blood moon, both will be visible with the naked eye.
If you can't make it to witness tomorrow's blood moon, next year will be your friend. New Yorkers will have to wait roughly one year for the next eclipse, which is set to happen on October 28, 2023.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/new-york-public-librarys-grand-central-location-will-close-in-december-081622,Timeout,"All the books will remain in the library's collection.
After more than a decade in operation, New York Public Library will close its Grand Central branch in December.
The Grand Central branch, located on East 46th Street, opened in 2009 as a temporary location to accommodate patrons during construction of the 53rd Street Library. Its lease expires at the end of this year, and the branch will close its doors on December 1, 2022.
“This decision was not easy, but after careful consideration, it is clear it is the right one,” the library’s President Tony Marx wrote in a statement published on Friday and emailed to Grand Central patrons.
While the Grand Central branch was always intended as temporary, its lease was extended in 2015 as construction at 53rd Street wore on and as the library faced a full renovation of its Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library (SNFL). The branch was known for its convenient location for commuters, local workers, and families living to the east.
The Grand Central library’s six full-time staff will continue to work in the New York Public Library system, and all the books from the branch will remain accessible in the library’s collection. In addition, the library is working to continue some of the branch’s programming at other nearby locations."
https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/buffalo-bill-house-silence-of-the-lambs-airbnb,Thrillist,"When a movie crew was scouting rural Pennsylvanian towns in the late '80s to find the perfect location for a serial killer’s gruesome demise, a long, simple hallway that sealed the deal. It was the ideal setting to transform into a dim, dilapidated corridor for the ultimate game of cat-and-mouse between a psychopath who keeps people in a pit for their skin and a novice FBI agent. “The team could envision the perfect chase scene down this center hallway that runs the whole length of the house, right down to the basement where the final scenes take place,” says Chris Rowan, who now owns this house where Jodie Foster's Agent Clarice Starling fatally shoots Ted Levine's serial killer Jame Gumb — also known as “Buffalo Bill” — in the Silence of the Lambs. During a visit to the property in late September, Rowan points out to visitors the scratches on the front door that are visible when Gumb first opens it to Agent Starling near the end of the film. He’s all about the details.
How did a prop stylist and art director from the New York City metro area come to own a former movie set in Perryopolis, a town in rural southwestern Pennsylvania? Rowan and his wife bought the house in 2020 for $290,000 when everyone was stuck at home and looking for new side projects. He could have tried his hand at sourdough, but after seeing the 1910 home listed for sale on a horror fan website, Rowan says he became “obsessed” with the idea of creating a horror-themed destination instead, down to collectible merchandise that includes hand-made lotion. “If you would have told me I would manufacture and distribute my own line of body lotion that I sell out of a rural Pennsylvania home, I would have said, 'You are bat-shit crazy,' but here we are.” He’s referencing the lotion which Buffalo Bill infamously lowers down a well to his victims, in an effort to soften their skin for his sewing machine.
Long enthralled with the complex psychological thriller, Rowan says he had no idea it was filmed nearly entirely in Pittsburgh until discovering the property. Now he’s running a guest house, tours, and helping fellow Silence aficionados cosplay their dream scenes, just about an hour outside the city.
The crew of 1991’s The Silence of the Lambs spent an entire year in Pittsburgh and the surrounding rural areas. The entire region fueled their creativity, Karen O’Hara, the prop stylist for the movie, told Thrillist.
When director Jonathan Demme and production designer Kristi Zea scouted the area in 1989, the vision within the unusual script came to life. “Kristi saw a man who raised pigeons in Glenwillard. We used that idea for Frederica Bimmel’s father. We found the Edward Check Funeral Home on a long drive out to Mckeesport looking for tools and tables we could rent for the Gumb basement.” The green-tiled room at that funeral home became the exam room where the agents first find a death’s head hawkmoth in a victim’s throat. The house now memorializes this moth with artwork as well as several actual specimens – many sent in by fans.
This ongoing interest spawned the idea of a dedicated event at the university's hall, which changes every fall as more horror fans become a part of the festivities. “This annual event is like a family reunion that grows a little bit each year,” says McBride. Rowanparticipates, of course – along with many others who come to screen the movie and pay homage. A fan donated what is believed to be the original rug from the cage. Her mother purchased the rug used, and the shop owner shared that the set decorators had rented it for the film. The movie’s metal fabricator, a local man named Joe Steinmetz, provides the actual blueprints he used to make the cell for the movie.
Alongside dedicated movie experiences like Bill’s house or the hall, the city is rife with memories of Silence scenes. Some spots around the city just have a history — and everyone knows it. When Heather LeVeck and her husband lived in the Bradford Court Apartments, fellow residents let them know that the scene depicting Buffalo Bill’s abduction of Catherine Martin was filmed at their very own home, right by the dumpsters. “Every time my husband took the trash out, I'd warn, ‘Watch out for cannibals.’""
Minutes away, visitors to the quiet stacks of the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh’s Oakland neighborhood will recognize the setting where an entomologist first identifies the death’s head hawkmoth for Agent Starling. This living cinematographic history in the region is part of why Rowan knew Buffalo Bill’s House could become a tourist destination unlike any other.
Visitors pulling up to Buffalo Bill’s house for their stay might be surprised at just how normal the setting is. The four-bedroom home sits on a large lot bordered by railroad tracks and the Youghiogheny River. The wraparound porch feels idyllic; peaceful. The unassuming setting for the house was part of its draw, says O’Hara. Gumb was running his house of horrors in Smalltown, USA. It could have been anyone’s neighbor.
O’Hara and her team worked tirelessly to amass the perfect props, but little remained from the movie when Rowan took over the house. It was a family home in the late '80s and '90s — the parents and their 6-year-old lived upstairs during filming — and it remained a residence until 2020. Upon purchasing the home, Rowan began the exhaustive-but-exciting process of bringing his vision to life. More AirBnB than actual B&B, Rowan designed the home to be rented by one group at a time. He’s collected fan art, commissioned custom bedding and decor, and fleshed out (pun intended) a fully immersive experience.
The main floor hasn’t changed much. The buffet where Bill rifles for a business card before bolting for his basement lair is now filled with movie memorabilia, and prop firearms are scattered throughout for guests who want to stage the showdown between good and evil. Mostly though, it’s a comfortable and functional space.
The four upstairs bedrooms, which were not featured in the movie, are packed with details. A sign above the toilet reminds guests to rub the lotion on their skin. The third floor has been transformed into Buffalo Bill’s Playroom, complete with antique arcade games, a pool table, and vast shelves of horror movies — Rowan’s own personal collection. “Many visitors actually choose to watch the movie while staying here,” he says. 'For all of the eerie memorabilia, the house feels oddly livable. It’s a turn-of-the-century Victorian classic with gorgeous, intricate woodwork and huge windows overlooking the river and mountains. The front porch beckons guests to curl up with a good book. The large dining room is made to be filled with laughter over shared meals.
Rowan’s pièce de résistance, though, is the basement.
In the movie, it’s the setting of Bill’s workshop. The upstairs is a ramshackle mess of clutter, but the basement is where he can be his true self. When guests stumble down the stairs from the kitchen, a motion sensor trips as Rowan begins to set the scene. He’s good at this — it's his job, after all.
“Goodbye Horses” by Q Lazzarus plays, just as in the film, as guests are beckoned into the workshop. Sewing machines, dress forms and patterns, and the preserved head of Bill’s first victim in a bucket are staged throughout the space while a disco ball spins. They’re free to try on the outfits, pose at the sewing machine — touch and explore everything.
Bill keeps his victims in a basement well. That’s one part of the set that was never actually in this home — it was inspired by a well in the property's yard, but was created in a soundstage. From the moment Rowan acquired the house, he knew he would recreate the well in the basement. “Bill’s house wouldn’t be complete without it,” he says.
He enlisted the skill of local-but-world-famous special effects and makeup artist, Tom Savini. He runs a special effects school in a nearby town, and he and his students worked closely with Rowan to make a perfect (though shallower) replica of the well for photo opportunities. Even the bloody scratches on the walls created during desperate escape attempts are visible. “This is the type of project our school loves to be part of, paying homage to a film masterpiece like Silence,” says Savini."
https://www.eater.com/2018/9/28/17490876/chefs-table-gaggan-anand-season-2-episode-6,Eater,"The Gaggan Anand episode of Chef’s Table is a portrait of a chef who developed a distinctive style of cooking after working a series of unremarkable kitchen jobs early in his career. Anand is one of the most charismatic people ever featured on Netflix’s docuseries, and by the end of this chapter, it’s easy to see why the chef and his restaurant have developed such a dedicated following. This standout episode was directed by the show’s creator, David Gelb.
As a young man growing up in India, Gaggan was not a particularly good student. His family was poor, but he managed to go to university and then culinary school, where he excelled. Gaggan got a job in a hotel during his third year as a student, but he quit because of the hostile attitude of the chefs who ran the kitchen. “I just hated it, I couldn’t accept it,” he says. The chef contemplated giving up cooking, but then he met a businessman who convinced him to start an industrial catering business — a “food factory kind of thing.” His partner split after launching the company, and Anand went into debt trying to keep the floundering business alive.
Gaggan then got a lifeline, of sorts, from his brother, who hooked him up with a deal to take over the cafeteria at the big company he worked for. “His brother was actually the guy pushing Gaggan all the time, at that point of time,” the chef’s current business partner, Rajesh Kewalraman, explains. “He actually changed all his negativity into courage to motivate him to pursue his dreams.” Soon, the chef managed hundreds of employees and was serving around 5,000 people a day. Gaggan pretty much stopped cooking to focus on the business side of things, and that’s when he started to worry that he’d lost touch with his food.
Minibar was opened by José Andrés 10 years ago, and has since earned two Michelin stars through it’s avant-garde dishes. The restaurant’s chefs make all dishes in front of each guest, including monkfish, maize butterflies, wagyu aburi, strawberry milk, and more.
After helping some other people launch their projects, Gaggan accepted an opportunity to open a new restaurant in Bangkok called Red. He immediately fell in love with Thailand, and the restaurant was a big hit. At the suggestion of a restaurant critic, Anand began researching Ferran Adrià’s work at El Bulli, and that’s when the got the idea to start experimenting with cooking Indian food using modern techniques.
One drunken night, Gaggan’s friends convinced him that he needed to have his own restaurant where he could cook the type of experimental food he was now obsessed with. He called up his business partner in the middle of the night and pitched him the idea. Much to his surprise, Kewalraman went along with it, and with some newfound free time before opening the restaurant, Gaggan decided to go work as an apprentice at El Bulli. “I want to learn from the lion how to hunt,” he told his partner.
The opening of his eponymous, forward-thinking restaurant took longer than anticipated, partially because of political protests involving the construction team. When the doors opened, Gaggan cooked “chicken tikka, curry, and naan bread” just to make some money back. Then, a few months after opening the restaurant, the chef’s brother died. Before he passed, Gaggan’s sibling left him a message that included the phrase, “Be famous, show the world that Gaggan is the only one.” That letter gave him the strength to get back in the kitchen, where he now felt fearless. “I was cooking what I wanted to cook, and the restaurant here became very successful,” he says.
On how Indian food has developed over the years: “When you look at India, our cuisine has 30 to 36 cuisines itself, completely different to the geography, but then they all become a curry. Curry came from British, the word. They named anything that was saucy or soupy a curry. In our own language, there’s no word called ‘curry.’ My mom doesn’t know what is a curry. So what we have done is taken any invasion that has happened — the British; before the British it was the Mughals — they have actually changed the cuisine of the country.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/why-did-ihop-change-to-ihob-june-3-2019,Thrillist,"It was about this time last year that the International House of Pancakes pulled a publicity stunt that somehow managed to take over social media for days at a time. IHOP flipped the ""P"" in its name to become IHOb, the International House of Burgers.
The stunt was just an attempt to let people know they had burgers and not just pancakes. It didn't take long for IHOb to go back to IHOP. It has stayed that way for a blissful year of just regular old pancake slinging. But we're about to go back into the maw of the beast.
On May 27, IHOP started to tease another name change. Kind of. Though it's already gone back to IHOP from the days of IHOb, it ran ads during the Stanley Cup Final and on Twitter saying it's taking on a new meaning. The ""P"" is no longer pancakes, probably. It started with a tweet that says, ""What could the P be? Find out June 3.""
It worked last time, so why not go back to the well?
The reactions on Twitter have been a mix of IHOP name-change exhaustion and jokes at the chain's expense. Though that was kind of the case last time as well, so maybe everyone is just playing into their hands once more by hating the game the breakfast joint is playing.
We'll have to wait until June 3 to find out if any of these are correct."
https://www.thrillist.com/eat/new-orleans/the-most-classic-restaurants-in-new-orleans,Thrillist,"There’s no place where you’re guaranteed a classic restaurant experience quite like New Orleans. With roots more than 300 years old, the city’s dining scene has standards that have outlasted generations—for good reason.
New Orleans’ reputation for fine dining, hospitality, and outstanding food started early, which means some of the restaurants on this list are the foundational blocks in creating that expectation for both travelers and locals alike. From old-school Italian joints to the grandest of Grande Dame affairs, here’s your guide to the most classic, quintessential restaurants in NOLA.
$$$French QuarterThough the salmon pink building at the heart of the French Quarter sat quiet for some time during a family dispute, it reopened in 2014 and quickly regained its status as a New Orleans institution. After all, what do you expect from the place that invented Bananas Foster? While you dine, you’ll feel the heat as flames rise while diners at nearby tables admire their own.How to book: Reserve via OpenTable.
$$TremeThis Treme classic opened in 1957, at the time pulling triple duty as a restaurant, barber, and hair salon. That combo didn’t last long, but its reputation for perfect fried chicken sure did, and these days, it’s not uncommon to wait for a table, especially after the family-owned restaurant was named to the list of America’s Classic Restaurants by the James Beard Foundation in 2005.How to book: Stop by for first come, first served seating or order takeout and delivery online.
$$TremeKnown for chef Leah Chase’s fried chicken and seasonal gumbo z’herbes, Dooky Chase’s Restaurant opened in 1941 and is still run by the Chase family to this day. The restaurant has fed New Orleans politicians, American presidents, and served as an organizing space for the Civil Rights Movement, so its place in American history—and New Orleanians’ hearts—is cemented forever.How to book: Call ​504-821-0600 to reserve.
$$$$Since Jean Galatoire founded this Bourbon Street institution in 1905, it has become the go-to place to see and be seen in the French Quarter. Plus, it remains one of the finest places to grab classic New Orleans dishes and it continues to be one of the best places to eat (and to be seen) in New Orleans.

What hasn’t changed is the classic approach to its menu—you can get a traditional Shrimp Creole, BBQ shrimp, veal chop, or lamb loin, as well as the famous brisket with Creole horseradish sauce.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/nyc-is-home-to-three-of-the-cheapest-michelin-starred-restaurants-in-the-us-072222,Timeout,"Devour delicious food for less than $50 per person at these local spots.
The price of just about anything is going up these days but, believe it or not, you can now eat a delicious meal at a Michelin-starred restaurant in New York for less than $50 per person. Turns out, our very own city is actually home to three of the most affordable Michelin-starred eateries in all of the United States.
Chef's Pencil, an international food magazine based in Australia, crunched the numbers to determine a ranking of the most economical such destinations around the country, specifically looking at the cost of the most affordable three-course meal on each restaurant's menu.
Offering a $39 three-course menu, The Clocktower on Madison Avenue by Madison Square Park lands at number four on the list. Would-be diners can expect top-notch British cuisine from the hands of chef Jason Atherton and restaurateur Stephen Starr. If you’re going for the most affordable combo, you’ll want to stop by for brunch, and order the Clocktower Scotch egg with buttermilk pancakes.
Number five on the ranking is Oxalis, the new American restaurant right by Prospect Park in Brooklyn. At $40 per person, the fixed-price Sunday brunch by chef Nico Russell is basically a steal and features an egg dish, a starch, a vegetable or a salad and a dessert. Bonus points: the eatery is close to the Brooklyn Museum, making it an ideal weekend destination right before or after a visit to the cultural center.
Number seven on Chef's Pencil's ranking is Casa Enrique, the Mexican restaurant in Long Island City that chef Cosme Aguilar opened to much fanfare a decade ago. With a beautiful garden out back, the restaurant serves traditional plates that pay homage to the chef's own late mother. Price-wise, expect a top-notch meal for as low as $47 per person."
https://www.eater.com/ad/maps/date-night-restaurants-for-parents-in-nyc,Eater,"We kept the cost of a babysitter in mind, too.
Finding a romantic restaurant where parents can enjoy each other’s company and feel like they’re escaping the chaos of family life for a few hours is a tall order. Add in the budget of paying the babysitter and you could easily be looking at several hundred dollars just for one night out. Thankfully, it is possible for parents to have a date night in NYC without the kids (read: not going to a chain restaurant or fast casual joint) without breaking the bank. In fact, we teamed up with Total by Verizon, a no-contract carrier that also doesn’t do sacrifices, to round up the options below.
Eataly Flatiron’s rooftop space changes with the seasons, and it’s currently all dressed up for fall, so you and your partner can surround yourselves with vibrant autumn colors while staying nice and warm. The restaurant’s seasonal menu is full of hearty, warming dishes, like Casarecce al Ragu` di Funghi (Wild Hive dark rye casarecce, oyster mushroom ragù, and Fulvi Pecorino Romano) and the Insalata Autunnale con Farro (toasted farro, Italian chicories, honeycrisp apple, and cranberry vinaigrette). Pair your cozy meal with a Nebbiolo, Barolo or a cocktail like the Floating into Fall, made with bourbon, amaretto, amaro, maple syrup, and topped with maple sugar.
Recently relocated after closing its original Fort Greene location, this late-night favorite is now on bustling Vanderbilt Avenue in Prospect Heights. This spot is perfect for couples looking to have a lively night out, thanks to its bar that stays open late. Menu favorites like the famous broccoli tacos are still around, but they are joined by new dishes too. For example, a fish soup made with fluke, striper and smoked trout in a saffron broth is accompanied by tobiko toast. Or, if you’re feeling a breakfast-for-dinner vibe, go with the so-called “big chicken” and a side of black truffle scrambled eggs.
When this Carroll Gardens spot opened last summer, it was an instant hit. Is it the delectable pastas, leafy patio with a vintage Vespa and jaunty striped umbrellas, or the all Italian wine list? Nobody can say for sure, but when combined they make for a truly romantic date night. Sit back, relax, order the cacio e pepe arancini, spiedini, fusilli with Nonna’s ragu, branzino, and of course save room for the tiramisu — you’re sure to both leave happy.
Haven’t you heard? Semma, the newest restaurant from Unapologetic Foods, the Indian-owned restaurant group behind Dhamaka and Masalawala & Sons, recently received a Michelin star. Semma manages to be both fun and fancy, approachable and exquisite, and unapologetically spicy (in more ways than one). Semma specializes in southern Indian food, so be sure to order the gunpowder dosa, Goanese oxtail, and the nathai pirattal, made with local Peconic snails cooked with ginger and tamarind.
Opened recently by husband-wife duo Chef Jimmy Ly and Yen Vo of Madame Vo, Monsieur Vo is their new 58-seat restaurant that acts as a love letter to the Vietnamese men in their lives and the dishes they love to eat. This translates into menu items like a deconstructed banh mi on a board, a dry chicken pho with rice noodles, and a massive beef shank inspired by the best-selling Central Vietnamese lemongrass soup Bun Bo Hue from Madame Vo. A long list of sake-based cocktails is perfect for pairing with the dishes, too.
Whether you and your partner are vegan or not, Ras Plant Based provides delicious and interesting food that’s satiating — and well spiced. Specializing in vegan Ethiopian cuisine, if you’re new to the restaurant we suggest one of the two sampler platters, where you’ll get to try everything from their mushroom tibs to spicy lentil missir, with plenty of spongy injera bread to soak it up.
If you’re looking to give yourselves a bit of royal treatment, head to new Thai spot KRU, the brainchild of husband-and-wife team Chef Ohm Suansilphong of Fish Cheeks and Kiki Supap, a third-generation Thai dessert chef. Chef Ohm, an avid student of Thai culinary history, studied  the recipe books of affluent families dating back to the 19th century and discovered recipes that were first served in Thailand’s Royal Palace and aristocracy, using international ingredients. Now KRU takes a similar cosmopolitan approach that honors tradition. A robust menu of small plates, relishes and dips, soups and stews, and large share plates mean plenty of options for an affordable night or a splurge.
This West Village spot from a few Eleven Madison Park alums opened in June and has been doing brisk business ever since. The minimalist modern room features green and earthy tones with custom banquettes in shades of cognac tanned Italian leather and golden ochre velvet, perfect for snuggling. The menu changes with the seasons and features locally sourced ingredients as much as possible, but look for Peeko oysters, Hudson Valley foie gras, and whole roasted chicken for two.
Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s new temple to all things French, fun and flavorful would make for an adventurous date night, filled with sampling from different stalls, markets, and restaurants, all under one utterly fabulous roof. Don’t miss the Double Yolk if you like eggs and caviar, Shikku for sushi and sake, The Frenchman’s Dough for French-inspired pizzas and pastas, and the sexy Speakeasy Chinese supper club, the Red Pearl. Buy some flowers and craft chocolate on the way out for your honey.
This lounge by Greg Baxtrom the hipper, younger cousin to his restaurant Olmsted, offers a bubbly atmosphere with the bar as the focal point, ideal for those looking to leave their parental woes behind (or at the bottom of a Sake Negroni glass). Bonus: the small space forces you to scrunch together, so go on and get close! The food is a mashup of French and Japanese, with skewers and small but shareable plates the name of the game. The tuna niçoise sashimi, cauliflower okonomiyaki, and the duck tsukune a l’Orange are menu mainstays for good reason.
Holywater may not boast waterfront views, like the Crew hospitality group’s other NYC restaurants Pilot and Grand Banks, but the nautical vibes are on in full force. The food and drinks are New Orleans inspired, and you’ll probably want to start off with a cocktail like Arnaud’s Special Cocktail or the Mezcal Hurricane. There are oysters a-plenty here, plus three versions of seafood towers if you’re looking to go all out. Otherwise, order the caviar tater tots, steak frites, and be sure to save room for the pralines, based on the brother owners’ mom’s New Orleans recipe.
Although it originally opened as an Austrian café in 2019, when Chef Kate Telfeyan (previously of Mission Chinese) took over she updated the all-day menu with items influenced by Korean, Taiwanese, and Sichuan cuisines. Now it includes nori fried pork chops, black pepper prawns with Korean rice cakes, and hot and sour potatoes in the evenings. Oh, and in case you haven’t heard, The Irishman was filmed here — so you know it’s got an interesting design.
If you and your SO are into Nigerian food — or always wanted to try it — this new spot offers a tasting menu inspired by North-Central Nigerian cuisine. Dept. of Culture was born out of the IYA EBA popup dinner series, hosted by Ayo Balogun of the Council Café, and now it offers a dinner party vibe in an intimate Bed-Stuy space. On the $90 four-course menu are Nigerian specialities that might include pepper soup and okele.
This petite restaurant on a quiet side street feels effortlessly romantic and cozy — it’s the kind of place that makes you feel young and cool for discovering it, even though you have littles at home. You’ll be transported to an Italian wine bar the moment you sit down and the (likely Italian) waiter hands you a well-worn menu of classic antipasti and pastas, along with a long list of mostly natural wines. Of course, they will gladly make some recommendations - and they will all be perfetto!
If you have any doubts about the stylishness of Hungarian food, they will be quelled immediately upon entry to Agi’s Counter. Bouquets of hanging dried flowers, a terrazzo bar, and brightly patterned dishes greet you, while a menu of comfort food beckons. Dinner is a fairly new offering here, and it includes things like pastrami tongue Caesar, duck borscht chicken liver mousse, and a spin on spaetzle, made with hazelnuts and dandelion greens cooked with chili and garlic. Dessert is a must — whatever’s in the pastry case is sure to be a winner, or call for the sundae made with poppy seed ice cream and plum caramel.
Definitely one of the city’s most romantic restaurants, Il Buco will bring you back to your pre-children days when you could loll at a table, sip on bottomless glasses of wine, and nipple on on the housemade sourdough bread with an olive oil sampler and handmade salumi while waiting for the pasta course. (The torchio pasta with duck sausage or the spaghetti with swordfish, perhaps?) You can easily fill up on apps and pastas, but if you’re going all out, you should enjoy veal and Wagyu beef from Provitello Farm, Bella Bella Farm chicken, or Atlantic Wild King Salmon.
Astoria recently scored a classy Turkish restaurant perfect for date nights that won’t empty your wallet. The traditional menu features a variety of doughy pides, pillowy manti, juicy kofte and kebabs, plus a range of mezze that you can easily make a meal out of. Save room for the homemade baklava and gooey knafeh.
This cozy Greenpoint space inside an old laundromat (hence the name) features candlelit tables and spare furnishings, plus an open kitchen to watch the action. The twist? Instead of an in-house chef, it hosts a rotating residency of chefs from around the world, some of whom have previously held stints at their original Paris location, and each offers a pre-fixe menu for $85. Currently holding court in the kitchen is former chef de cuisine of Septime and Double Dragon in Paris, Antoine Villard.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/niclas-castello-gold-cube-exhibit-central-park-nyc,Thrillist,"For a few hours on Wednesday, joggers and walkers in New York City's Central Park played witness to a strange sight: a 410-pound cube of pure gold.
The cube appeared at the Naumburg Bandshell around 5 am and was on display until sundown, drawing a crowd of onlookers who were closely watched by the sculpture's private security detail.
The gold cube is the work of German artist Niclas Castello, who told ArtNet that the sculpture is ""a conceptual work of art in all its facets, [meant to] create something that is beyond our world—that is intangible."" Naturally, he rolled it out alongside a cryptocurrency called The Castello Coin, with the pairing serving as something of a commentary on the value of currency in both ancient and modern societies.
The cube was cast at a foundry in Switzerland. It measures about 18 inches on all sides, and the gold is roughly one-quarter inch thick. It weighs 410 pounds, making the 24 karat, 99.9% pure-gold cube worth around $11.7 million.
Castello's cube has already been removed from the park. So far, there's no word on where it will end up next, but a few lucky park-goers on Wednesday certainly struck gold.
Less than 48 hours after Castello's cube disappeared, Velveeta decided to replicate his stunt with a giant box of cheese. Located in the same location as the gold cube, the box measures eight feet in length and is on display for park-goers and Velveeta fans alike. The box also comes with its own security, although something tells us people are a lot less likely to steal cheese than gold.
According to Velveeta, their stunt is a more humble take on the multi-million-dollar golden sculpture. ""The brand is all about encouraging people to be confident, unapologetically themselves, and constantly reminds us that you don’t have to live rich to be golden and lead a lavish, pleasure-filled life,"" the brand said in a press statement."

""Mercury in retrograde is no joke and I do whatever I can to combat those bad vibes from extra quality time with my hummingbirds to cleansing my crystal collection and more,"" reality star and crystal enthusiast Spencer Pratt, who partnered with the brand for its latest promotion, said in a statement to Thrillist. ""I've always been a Taco Bell superfan and was so pumped to team up with Uber Eats and Taco Bell to bring together my two favorite things, Crystals and Nachos.""
Making the cart minimum for this promotion and getting the chance to win that crystal should be easy. Taco Bell has introduced many innovations in the last year, including Loaded Nacho Fries, a Truff Hot Sauce collab, and a Crispy Fried Chicken Sandwich Taco.

It’s been a long and bumpy ride, albeit certainly a memorable one. But, as they say, all good things come to an end: the ubiquitous MetroCard machines that have been peppering our subway stations since 1999 are going to be phased out in “the not-so-distant future,” according to a tweet by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).
The ticket dispensers will officially be replaced with OMNY vending machines, the tap-to-pay stations that have already been installed across certain stations. According to Curbed, ""the switch [...] will be complete by the end of 2023.""
Although this isn’t the first time that the city moves forward with changes concerning our decrepit-but-still-essential subway system (subway tokens!), the updates feel bittersweet. There is just something about the colorful machines that is so utterly New York.
Usually disinclined to profess their love for anything concerning the city's transportation system, New Yorkers have taken to social media to—gasp!—sorrowfully mourn the imminent passing of the ticket machines, a fact that points to the stature of the objects within the local cultural canon.
Alas, it's time to move on. Although we'll surely miss the familiar sight of the dispensers in the near future, we have to make one admission: we absolutely love the OMNY machines. They are easy to use (just tap!), don't require extra card storage in our wallets and they, hopefully, shed some minutes off commutes.
That being said: thank you for all your help throughout the years, MetroCard vending machine."
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/new-yorkers-are-urged-to-report-dining-sheds-that-should-be-removed-010423,Timeout,"Hundreds of unused and dilapidated structures have already been taken down.
Have we (finally) reached the end of the city's relationship with outdoor dining sheds?
Despite needing them to experience a semi-semblance of normalcy throughout the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the huts have brought along with them more issues than solutions since indoor dining formally resumed.
As chronicled by New Yorkers on the Internet and the media in general, the structures have become versions of homeless shelters while also effectively diminishing the number of parking spots available throughout town. Locals have also noticed a rise in garbage and pest-related issues in connection to the presence of the shacks.
In an effort to help the situation, though, the New York City Department of Sanitation is now asking city dwellers to help clean the streets up by reporting ""useless [and] abandoned"" dining sheds to the authorities.
Let's be clear: according to CBS News, the agency's goal is to bring the outdoor huts up to compliance. The last resort would be to actually taken them down but—alas—the outlet reports that about 169 huts that were either abandoned or had a history of violations have already been removed in Queens.
""No one is a fan of abandoned sheds... So what happens now?,"" reads a recent tweet by the department. ""See a shed that needs to go? Call 311.""
Of course, we are oh-so-grateful to the huts. Who can forget the first time we actually stepped foot inside of a restaurant shed following months of panic, grocery wipe-downs and nights spent alone in our apartments nursing bottles of wine wondering when life-as-we-knew-it would resume?
As creative and useful as the structures have been, though, it's time to move away from them—especially those left abandoned and in disrepair, a true eyesore in this beautiful city of ours."

Forgive us for thinking that the era of clubbing had ended: joining a pretty hefty roster of new nightclub debuts is SILO, a dance music club with a capacity for 500 people set to open on February 10 at 90 Scott Avenue in East Williamsburg.
The destination, the brainchild of promoters Alex Neuhausen and Lilly Wolfson, will be set up inside a converted hangar, so you can expect industrial touches to characterize the internal decor, which will also feature custom lighting setups and a high-contrast projection system that will allow the staff to map images on the ceiling and the walls, effectively turning the venue into an immersive one.
SILO, formerly known as Secret Loft, began as an underground party in a converted auto garage in Williamsburg. It took years for Neuhausen and Wolfson to find the perfect space.
Entertainment-wise, the carbon-neutral club will focus on all genres of dance music, hosting a variety of producers and DJs throughout the months (including an all-nighter with popular artist Eli Escobar!) alongside vinyl-only nights.
The opening of SILO follows other similar ones all across York City in the past few months, including giant electronic music nightclub Virgo; Nebula, the largest destination of its kind to debut in Manhattan in years; and the Italian Musica, which is apparently the biggest nightclub in town and is backed by Cipriani owner Tito Pinton.

Subwaydle uses the same format as Wordle to plot a transit trip across New York City. Players must guess the mystery three-train route in six tries using only valid transfers. Like the original game, the line will turn green if it's in the proper position and yellow if it's part of the final answer but in the wrong order. You can even share your color-coded results on social media.
The game was created by New York City-based software engineer Sunny Ng. He's an avowed transit fan who has also put his coding skills to work building a real-time subway map and a service tracker for the system. Subwaydle may not fetch Ng a seven-figure payout like Wordle did with its recent purchase by The New York Times, but the game is a fun pastime for the city's transit experts.

Shake Shack has enlisted Milk Bar to create the all-new Chocolate Birthday Cake Shake and Cornflake Chocolate Drizzle Shake. While the new offerings will formally launch at Shake Shack locations on September 3 and be available until November 1, fans can already snag the flavors exclusively through the app.
""We’ve been big fans of Milk Bar since day one. They share our same New York City DNA and dedication to providing fun and delicious reimagined takes on classic American fare,"" Culinary Director for Shake Shack Mark Rosati told Thrillist. ""Our new Shake Shack x Milk Bar shakes merge the very best of our two worlds, blending our fresh-made frozen custard, made with real sugar and cage-free eggs, with Milk Bar treats, creating a new and magical experience that our guests are going to love. Partnering with Christina Tosi and her Milk Bar team has been an absolute blast.""
The Chocolate Birthday Cake Shake features Milk Bar B'Day frosting and Milk Bar B'Day crumbs in a hand-spun chocolate cake frozen custard with whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles on top, while the Cornflake Chocolate Drizzle Shake has got Milk Bar Cornflake Crunch, hand-spun malted vanilla frozen custard, and Milk Bar chocolate fudge drizzle with mini marshmallows.
""Any excuse to crush milkshakes at breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the name of menu development, I happily race toward. To make milkshake dreams come true with our BFFs at Shake Shack?!"" Christina Tosi, chef and founder of Milk Bar said in a press release. ""Those are LIFE GOALS. Celebrating Shake Shack’s frozen custard through the lens of our Chocolate B’day Cake and Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmallow Cookies, we balanced the ooh and the goo, the flavors and the textures from these Milk Bar classics and spun them into shakes that we cannot wait for you to get your hands on!"""

The immersive experience trend continues strong with Wonderland Dreams, a newly announced interactive wine bar loosely inspired by Lewis Carroll's 1865 iconic English novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The cultural offering is scheduled to debut in midtown Manhattan at 529 Fifth Avenue by 44th Street on October 7 and run through late April 2023.
The venue, which boasts 20 different rooms filled with eye-catching sights, sounds pretty remarkable: Alexa Meade, the artist behind the Ariana Grande painting featured in the artist’s “God is a Woman” music video, has hand-painted the 26,000-square-foot space where the experience will take place (the destination is actually the old Best Buy on Fifth Avenue by Grand Central).
Among the plenty of interactive installations on-premise will be a living art gallery that quite literally puts visitors inside a picture frame, a secret rose garden, giant playing cards and more.
""People can touch and explore the world's biggest painting and [...] then finish off at the new bar themed around the Mat Hatter's Tea Party,"" reads an official press release.
Speaking of the bar, which will serve drinks that change colors, tiny cupcakes and oversized cookies: the entire experience is a collaboration with Catching Flights, the company behind the now-defunct Rosé Mansion, a wine-bar-slash-amusement-park of sorts that launched by the Empire State Building pre-pandemic.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/anthony-bourdains-and-eric-riperts-good-evil-chocolate-bar-now-at-williams-sonoma,Thrillist,"There are few, if any, bromances between culinary heavyweights quite like that of bad-boy food celebrity Anthony Bourdain and renowned Le Bernardin chef Eric Ripert. They've been known to cook together, eat spicy Sichuan food together on Bourdain's show Parts Unknown, and now, the old pals have come together for a fresh new version of their chocolate bar collaboration, ""Good & Evil,"" for Williams-Sonoma.
Williams-Sonoma said the fancy dark chocolate is defined by its ""velvety smoothness and intensely complex flavor"" that bring together the pleasure of delicious food (the good) and indulging in decadence (the evil). The chocolate is made in the traditional European style by Master Chocolatier Christopher Curtin of Éclat Chocolate and comprises 72% premium cacao, so basically, you can count on it tasting great with red wine and coffee or espresso.
""A little guilt, in appropriate amounts, can only make one's simple pleasures better,"" Bourdain said in a press release. ""This bar contains the perfect blend of good ingredients and evil intent. Enjoy it at your peril. You'll be back for more.""
You may recall Bourdain and Ripert first launched the ""Good & Evil"" bar (also in partnership with Éclat Chocolate) back in 2012, but this time, it's been reformulated with a new recipe that's certified fair trade and organic, according to a Williams-Sonoma spokesperson. Ripert said the new recipe also improves the overall taste of the chocolate.
""The texture has been refined to perfection and the flavor profile is slightly less bitter than the original recipe,"" the chef said in a statement.
The new ""Good & Evil"" bar will set you back $12.95 instead of $18 like the original. You'll only be able to buy them at Williams-Sonoma locations or its online store, though. Speaking of which, both Bourdain and Ripert will make an appearance at the retailer's Columbus Circle location in NYC on Friday, December 2nd, at 5pm to sign chocolate bars and cookbooks to celebrate the chocolate bar's launch. Sure, tickets start at $40 and it'll probably be damn near impossible to get in, but at least this means you have a new gift idea for the raging Bourdain fan in your life."
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/heres-what-it-was-like-getting-a-biggie-metrocard-over-the-weekend-052322,Timeout,"New Yorkers waited hours to get a card, only to discover machines were taking cash.
Hundreds of New Yorkers waited in hours-long lines to get their very own MetroCard emblazoned with the Notorious B.I.G.'s face. It was a special edition MetroCard issued to celebrate what would've been the late artist's 50th birthday.
As any New Yorker knows, it takes a few minutes to get one MetroCard. Multiply that by 50,000 (how many of these cards were available) and you've got super long lines in the sweltering heat. These cards were only available at three Brooklyn stations—Lafayette Avenue, Clinton-Washington Avenue and Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center—at 12:01am on May 21, near Biggie's home in Bed-Stuy, so there was no spacing out to be done.
Some complained of two- to four-hour waits. Some finally got up to the MetroCard machine to find out that it became cash only. Others spotted people buying up stacks of them only to resell them for more money.
It took 57 hours for them to completely sell out—the last vending machine with the Notorious B.I.G MetroCards sold out this morning, by 9am, according to the MTA.
These special edition MetroCards are released as a way to generate revenue, according to the MTA. (The agency sells space on the cards to advertisers.) This program has existed for many years but in 2012, the MTA renewed it by doing more of these kinds of campaigns that generate a lot of interest, including for Supreme, Game of Thrones, David Bowie, Wu-Tang Clan and Paul McCartney, among others. It's also designed cards for Pride, to honor veterans and has also done an Arts & Design campaign card that resulted in a card with the word ""Optimism"" on it.
Some of these cards, depending on their subject, have been listed on resell sites for way more than what they were originally purchased for. The Biggie cards are already listed for over $100, including one on eBay listed at a cool $1,200."

https://www.thrillist.com/lifestyle/new-york/best-nyc-blogs-food-news-new-york-neighborhoods,Thrillist,"While there are countless major news and lifestyle sites that cover New York City (ahem), neighborhood blogs remain a vital resource for hyper-local, hard-nosed reporting from people who actually live there.
After all, neighborhood bloggers are just as bummed about the closure of the corner Italian joint, just as furious about the high-rise casting shadows on your city view, and just as excited about the promised greenmarket, river clean-up, and new street art installation as you are. Local blogs and websites also tend to deliver the news faster than anyone else, since the writers and publishers are on the ground and more invested in the welfare of the community. Here are some of our absolute favorites -- from the Upper West Side to Greenpoint.
When a charming Sugar Hill home with original moldings goes on the market, Harlem + Bespoke is likely the first to cover it. That’s because the site covers local uptown news from “a designer’s point of view,” and has a keen interest in the neighborhood’s arts and architecture, be it a photography exhibit at El Museo del Barrio or tips for restoring the cast-iron posts of a 19th-century brownstone.
Greenpointers -- which grew from a personal blog started by local Justine Carroll into a hyper-focused media outlet -- is known for covering everything from local chefs in a series called “Behind the Toque” to Thursday Spotlights on hometown artists. “People who live and work here care about [them],” says owner Julia Moak, who also points out that Greenpointers doesn’t just inform readers, it also connects people in Greenpoint. News outlets might cover a neighborhood tragedy from a factual perspective, but Greenpointers will tell readers how to help, and bring people together for support and comfort.
This Queens blog, started by three local women in 2010, has an upbeat tone and a serious love for Astoria. Come here for advice on where to shop, what to eat (founder Meg Cotner authored the book The Food Lovers’ Guide to Queens), and what neighborhood party or street fair to attend (including the website’s own Best of Astoria bash).
“We’re pretty diverse,” says Traven Rice, co-founder of this Lower East Side blog known for everything from arts and culture to food and breaking news. “But the stuff we’ve been covering really in-depth lately has been small-business survival.” Rice and her founding partner, Ed Litvak, both have news and film backgrounds, making it easy for them to deliver hyper-local reporting to their community by way of The Lo-Down. “So much is changing so fast,” Rice says, citing the Essex Market expansion, the Seward Park improvement project, and the Essex Crossing development project.
Author Robert Lanham has taken it upon himself to document the rapid growth of the Brooklyn neighborhood. With a strong focus on the arts and culture, Free Williamsburg has been documenting the neighborhood’s momentous rise since 1998 -- and its inevitable expansion. The site now reports on events, concerts, and other happenings as far out as Greenpoint and neighboring Bushwick.
For residents of Carroll Gardens, Pardon Me for Asking -- a development-focused blog that gives readers information on everything from local meetings to the clean-up of the Gowanus Canal -- is a crucial resource. Founder Katia Kelly says the blog’s launch kicked off at “the beginning of the building boom in Brooklyn... the changes to the borough and to my own neighborhood were so dramatic that I felt compelled to document them.” Kelly also documents the closure of mom-and-pop stores and the loss of reasonably priced food stores, and interviews “old-timers” about what life in Carroll Gardens was like back in the day.
Don’t be misled by the cheerful title -- this Queens-based blog by journalist Christian Murray covers way more than just local events and bits of feel-good news. Sunnyside and Woodside denizens use the Post as a comprehensive guide to restaurant closings and openings, local crime reports, and even anti-gentrification projects. Murray also has blogs dedicated to Jackson Heights, Astoria, Forest Hills, and Long Island City.
A number of Upper West Siders contribute to the West Side Rag, which is a popular source for news and events throughout the neighborhood. While it’s a great place to find information about openings and closings, or discover local happenings (it publishes a calendar with dozens of events every week) residents also love the Absurdity section. Here, West Side Rag writers highlight the ridiculous things that happen in the neighborhood, like the time America’s Next Top Model turned the backyard of a local townhouse into a catwalk."

Shoppers will get to browse through delicious Japanese snacks, items for the home, inexpensive toys, affordable cosmetics, useful baking and arts-and-crafts tools, tableware, stationery, organizing products and more much. You'll basically leave with a ton of stuff that you never thought you needed but can't wait to use around your home. The best part? The prices: most items average out at around $1.99.
Given the fact that Daiso operates 3,620 stores in Japan, plus 2,272 others around the world (including 80 in the United States), you can rest assured that the company knows exactly what it is doing.

Although a lot of chain restaurants have introduced chicken sandwiches over the last few years, none have garnered quite as much immediate buzz as the new one served at Popeyes. And now, less than two weeks after the dish’s nationwide release, it seems that battle lines are being drawn between Chick-fil-A fans and loyal Popeyes customers over which chain serves the One Chicken Sandwich to Rule Them All.
What's worse than heartbreak, you ask?Driving to your local Popeye's only to discover the chicken sandwich doesn't hit your area until Monday.
While Chick-fil-A has generally awful politics — the company famously funneled millions of dollars intro groups that oppose same-sex marriage — the chain ranks #1 in terms of customer satisfaction, and its pickle-laced crispy chicken sandwich is the star of its menu.  Popeyes, meanwhile, is a chain that also has a rabid fanbase, and now it too has a chicken sandwich with a similar composition — a crispy fried filet on a cushion of pickles, hugged by a pillowy bun —  that fans can enjoy on Sunday or any other day of the week without the guilt that comes from supporting a company with an anti-queer agenda.

Alas, that's the law of the land here in New York: delicious spots open and close without warning and citizens constantly feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of restaurants that they never have time to properly dine at. A world-renowned culinary scene will do that to you.

The summer reading list is a long tradition and this year, it’ll be easier than ever to get it done.
New York City’s three library systems—Brooklyn Public Library (BPL), New York Public Library (NYPL) and Queens Public Library (QPL)—are partnering up with the New York Life Foundation to give away 15,000 books for free to New York families across the city.
Throughout the weekend, and while supplies last, young readers can pick up books (in English and Spanish, and Chinese in some locations) to keep and also sign up for library cards.
This giveaway is meant to support New Yorkers in need and includes locations near Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Centers or shelters.
This is the fifth year the New York Life Foundation has supported summer reading and learning programs for the libraries. According to the libraries, summer breaks without learning and reading can cause the average student to lose up to two months of instruction every year, and students from low-income families are, of course, more affected by this."

No Hope After Dark is a terrifying journey on a historic train that departs New Hope bound for the “realm of the unknown.” The ride itself is a creepy, ominous journey through the woods that will keep you on the edge of your seat before you arrive at your final destination: a Halloween festival featuring a haunted maze where ghosts, goblins and creatures of the night lurk around every corner. On some nights, once you make your way through the maze, you’ll be rewarded with live music under the moonlit sky and food trucks serving delicious fare. The entire journey lasts just under two hours.
Rides on the train start on Friday, October 6 and will run every Friday through Sunday through Halloween. There will be occasional Wednesday and Thursday dates as well as added dates Monday, October 30, and Tuesday, October 31. Tickets start at $53 for coach seats and $79 for first-class seats. For those who dare, tickets are available here.
While the No Hope After Dark experience will be too frightening for anyone under the age of 13, New Hope Railroad offers a train ride for the little ones too.

In terms of groceries and food selection, shoppers will have more than 1,000 handpicked local items from NYC and the surrounding area to choose from. A special department dedicated to cheesemakers and artisan producers will be available as well, and customers will be able to order from full-service counters including seafood and meat.

https://www.eater.com/2019/5/28/18643105/ihop-is-doing-an-ihob-brand-stunt-again,Eater,"Let’s not reward this behavior!
Remember IHOB? It’s okay — lucky, even — if you don’t. It was an absurd attempt to garner attention and sales on behalf of IHOP last summer when the International House of Pancakes (serving flapjacks from exotic locales like the Netherlands and Italy...in the Olive Garden sense) “changed” its name to the International House of Burgers to promote its burger menu. People cringed. Other brands used it as an opportunity to stunt. It was all very silly.
Well, they’re at it again. IHOP is teasing that, while they’re sticking with the same IHOP acronym, the P  will stand for something other than pancakes for a short while. Pork? Pozole? P...avocado toast waffles? Propaganda? We’ll find out next week.
This is exhausting, and we only have ourselves to blame. Because last time, the damn stunt actually worked. IHOP sold four times the amount of burgers than it did before the name change: “Literally everybody in the world now knows that IHOP is now selling burgers,” IHOP’s president, Darren Rebelez, said, and he’s not entirely wrong. Far more people than before are aware that IHOP sells things beyond pancakes and french toast stuffed with various creams!
So, fine. Let us accept that P is for punishment, and this is the brand hellscape we’ve created for ourselves. It’s still not as bad as WcDonald’s."
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/subwaydle-is-an-addictive-subway-inspired-take-on-wordle-020422,Timeout,"Do your best to try and guess the train route!
Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last few W-E-E-K-S, you’ve probably heard of Wordle, the highly addictive daily puzzle that involves doing your best to guess a random five-letter word in a set number of tries. Since taking the world by storm, the game has been purchased by The New York Times, which is about the closest a brain teaser can come to having a Cinderella story.
Subwaydle, is a browser game where you’re given six chances to guess a subway trip with two different transfers. Similar to Wordle’s requirement that every guess be a real word, Subwaydle requires every guess to be an actual subway ride one could take underground in NYC—that is, of course, if all the trains are running as they should. If a train line isn’t part of the route it’s displayed as gray, if it is in the route but currently in the wrong spot it will be shaded yellow and if it’s both the right line and the right spot it will show up as green. A quick stop at a subway bar is not included on any trip.
The game was invented by Sunny Ng, an NYC software engineer who was partially inspired by pre-pandemic trivia nights at the New York City Transit Museum. Give a puzzle a go yourself, to see if you can crack it, but be warned: each weekday’s puzzle can be one of 6,835 combinations. (Hilariously, there are only 4,188 combinations on weekends because the game changes to reflect weekend service.) Heads up: you can ask for a hint that gives the trip’s start and end stations.
Good luck reaching your destination!"

And as with most big deals, excluding childhood dance recitals and the Yahoo-Tumblr merger, you might not want it to end. While that’s complicated by the 11pm deadline for places operating under the Open Restaurants Program, some spots, including the 16 on this guide, are staying open later by utilizing their own private outdoor spaces.
If you’re just looking for a midnight slice of pizza or platter of fried chicken, and would rather not leave your apartment, check out our Late-Night Delivery Guide. And if you know any places staying open late that we’ve missed here, please let us know at nyc@theinfatuation.com.
The Commodore isn’t exactly as you remember it. There are no last-call lights to “boo” at, and there’s no dancefloor to slide across as your friends pretend not to know you. But considering this Williamsburg spot still has frozen pina coladas and tequila banderas, those are sacrifices you should be more than happy to make. Stop by any day until midnight, and make sure to order a fried chicken sandwich.
There’s a difference between late-night on a weekday versus a weekend. While a beer and fried chicken sandwich might suffice on Tuesday, Saturday may require a burger topped with jerk fries and jerk mayo followed by milkshakes and frosé. Harlem Shake understands this, and offers all of it until 11pm during the week and 2am on weekends.
Berry Park is a rooftop for people who don’t like rooftops. It’s spacious with lots of seating, it’s never hard to get a drink, and for every person wearing Christian Dior, there tend to be just as many wearing Christian Pulisic jerseys who watched a match downstairs or played in one across the street in McCarren Park. And as it’s table-service-only right now, it’s even more low-key, which you can take advantage of by drinking frozen cocktails overlooking the Manhattan skyline until midnight or later Thursday through Saturday.
With a huge outdoor space filled with trees, dogs, and picnic tables, Nowadays feels a bit like a park. But instead of cold cuts, water bottles of pinot grigio, and aggressive rollerbladers, you’ll find fried chicken sandwiches and spicy margaritas. And rather than a “park closes at dark” sign, this Ridgewood spot has illuminated signs and hanging lights that stay on until midnight during the week and 2am on weekends.
Whether there are a ton of separation anxiety-riddled dog parents out there, or everyone just uses the same excuse to end dates early, The Springs is here to help the former and embarrass the latter. This Greenpoint bar, which has a massive, dog-friendly outdoor space, serves boilermakers and boozy slushy pitchers until 11pm during the week and 1am on weekends.
Asking if “swanimal fries” covered in melted cheese and caramelized onions would taste great when you’re sober is like asking what it’s like beyond the event horizon of a black hole. There’s just no way to know. Prove us wrong, or don’t, and pair those fries with some of the 20+ draft beers available at this English pub in Bed-Stuy, which offers outdoor seating until midnight every day.
Asking people their name and the date is one way to get a baseline for a lie detector test. Another is to ask if they’re a fan of great pasta and Italian wine. Anything besides a “yes” and a flat line would show that they’re clearly hiding something, and anything besides those results when asked specifically about Frank would be as good as a confession of guilt. Not only does this East Village spot serve fantastic orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage, but they also have a wine program that allows you to choose any bottle on the list, and only pay for what you drink, whether it’s a half-glass or 90% of the bottle.
When you find yourself in Coney Island after dark, you could reenact scenes from Adventureland or Zombieland, or ponder the fact that Jesse Eisenberg starred in both. Or you could head to Footprints Cafe. This Caribbean spot, which also has locations in Flatbush and East Flatbush, serves dishes like codfish cakes and curried goat, as well as colorful cocktails topped with slices of pineapple until midnight during the week and 2am on weekends.
We could start listing reasons you may feel like hovering your face over a steaming bowl of soup at 11pm, but to keep us from asking our engineers to build an infinite scroll function, we’ll just say “2020.” Whatever the reason, head to Up Thai on the Upper East Side, and order the kao soy or any of the rich, spicy curries until 10:30pm during the week or 11:30pm on weekends.
The good news is Patricia’s has most of the key late-night food groups - from pizza and chicken parm to rigatoni alla vodka and cannolis - available until 11pm on weekdays and midnight on weekends. The bad news is the menu at this classic Italian-American spot in Morris Park is very long, and without some impressive willpower, you’re going to end up eating leftover fettuccine alfredo and four-cheese pizza for days, which actually doesn’t sound too bad at all.
With string lights hanging over umbrella-covered picnic tables and turf floors, Freehold’s big backyard is so nice that we’d happily hang out there even if they only served blue drinks. Fortunately, that’s not a decision you’ll be faced with, as the drink menu at this Williamsburg bar ranges from excellent cocktails to large-format margaritas to 11-ounce pours of malbec for $12.
The burritos at Maya Taqueria are approximately the size of 1980s car phones. You certainly won’t need to order anything else, but you won’t complain about having a few churros afterwards, or finding some chicken mole tamales in your fridge tomorrow. Their locations in Prospect Heights and Park Slope are open until midnight every day.
The rooftop patio at this cocktail bar is always one of the best outdoor drinking options in Williamsburg, and Wednesday through Sunday until midnight, it still is. They’ve also put some tables on the sidewalk out front in case the roof is full or you have a fear of not very high heights.
A beer garden isn’t a place where beers are grown. If that statement is obvious to you, then this Hoboken spot’s name alone should paint a fairly complete picture of what it’s like. Get a picnic table with some friends, order sausage platters and giant pretzels, and drink any of their 70+ beers until 11pm on Thursdays or midnight on weekends.
Between boozy brunch with 3-for-1 cocktails, salads and sandwiches at lunch, and spaghetti pomodoro or a pizza topped with meatball ragu at dinner, Lil’ Frankies is the MacGyver of East Village restaurants. They even offer their full menu until midnight during the week and 2am on weekends.
If you’re looking for food when it’s almost ‘tomorrow’, order delivery from any of these 16 spots.

Popeyes is bringing on the heat. Apparently, the chain’s instant success with its spicy chicken sandwich has sparked a roll out of additional chili-spiked dishes. The company recently brought back its ghost pepper wings and in the latest reveal, participating restaurants are now selling a limited menu item: Wicked Shrimp.
While the popular chain may be best known for its fried chicken, there are plenty of fans that love all the other menu items—especially the seafood (here’s our ranking of all the sleeper hits).
The company won’t share the exact recipe, but the bite-sized Wicked Shrimp is marinated in an “authentic blend of herbs and spices,” including cayenne pepper and a few dashes of Sriracha.

It is a New York right of passage to to do something deeply embarrassing and forever memorable while out drinking at Dallas BBQ on the corner of Second Avenue and St. Mark's Place in the East Village.
Alas, city dwellers will soon have to settle on a new sort of local initiation ceremony as the downtown staple will officially shutter after service on December 31, as first reported by E.V. Grieve.
According to the outlet, ""news of a closure had been expected since an applicant for a new bar-restaurant appeared before Community Board 3 in June"" as the building's landlord did not want to renew the chain's lease and opted to find another tenant instead.
A brief history of the dingy-but-iconic family-owned brand: the original Dallas BBQ opened in 1978 on the Upper West Side Side and now lays claim to a dozen locations around town, including this one in the East Village that debuted some time in the 1980s. Back in 2018, rumors started swirling about a potential downtown closure but protests from regulars convinced the owners to stay put.
As sad as we are about the recent news, we are happy to cite E.V. Grieve's reporting that the staff at the East Village spot has ""been offered jobs at other locations, including one near JFK in Jamaica, Queens, and a new one set to open in New Jersey.""
As is always the case when updates of the sort are made public, New Yorkers have rallied on social media to pay their respects to the beloved venue while reminiscing about those, well, embarrassing but memorable nights spent on premise (including one experienced by yours truly back in 2007—when a pair of gloves and a portion of this then-college student's dignity were lost)."
https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/how-to-split-the-check,Thrillist,"Splitting the check has long lived on a fault line of perceived maturity. We’ve all felt the seismic rumblings over dotted-line niceties, followed by aftershocks of bruised feelings, reeling bank accounts, and tidal waves of after-dinner, passive-aggressive Venmo emojis. Friendships have been ruined. Dinner parties turned to Donner Parties. Posi-post-brunch-vibes, unplugged. Bill-cleaving has become a trope of situational comedy and even Silicon Valley startups have thrown their hats in the ring, creating apps that do the work for you.
But what is truly the sensible move here? Do you split evenly, or go order-by-order? Do you just put it all on one card and fly by IOUs? When you reach a certain age, requests for personalized checks at group dinners are oft met by groans and whispers of ""tight-ass,"" (not the good kind). But is this free-wheeling communal splitting -- and not the devil's avocado toast -- why our generation can't afford to buy homes?
The truth is, the ability to successfully split a check with friends, acquaintances, and assorted frenemies can be both a benchmark of maturity and your own personal bildungsroman, which is always nice.
You just have to know how to be smart about it, dummy.
""It’s much, much easier for the server to just split the check evenly. Don’t be an asshole.""
""I didn’t order any alcohol, I shouldn’t have to pay as much.""
""What?! I ordered the cheapest thing on the menu, and you got the lobster-stuffed lobster burger with a side of gold-plated truffles! Also, what does uncouth mean?""
It is (obviously) much easier for servers to split the checks evenly, and even easier to not split at all.
By asking your server to split the check -- whether it’s before you order, after you order, or three days ahead of your reservation to simply avoid the awkwardness -- you are inherently causing more work for them. But that doesn’t make you a dick.
Being a dick to your server is treating them like servants. It’s snapping your fingers for service, or stuffing disgusting napkins in your water glass.
Asking a server to give everyone a separate, order-specific check is like asking the quaint jazz trio that plays your wedding to specifically learn ""Love Shack,"" because it's ""your song."" Sure, it’s a annoying, but it's part of the gig. Most restaurants operate with computerized POS systems that allow the servers to place items on separate bills fairly easily. The ""hard"" part is organization. If you are polite and clear, splitting several checks -- even unevenly -- should not be an issue.
But alas, every pitcher of communal rosé has its thorns. Splitting three cards by order is fine -- splitting 30 cards by order is harder than explaining 3-D printers to your great grandma.
So in the end, this isn't a game of Monopoly: There are definitely some clear, definable rules, here. You can't just flip the board over and be done with it if your sister has more money than you do.
S - Six cards is the absolute freakin’ limit if you want individual specialized checks -- and even that is pushing it. If you are splitting things evenly, there’s a little wiggle room (depending on the restaurant), but this is basically the breaking point. If you go over, you better be dropping at least 25% on the gratuity line.
P - Plan ahead, and order accordingly -- for everyone’s sake. Make sure the conversation isn’t kept to a scramble at the end. Have a game plan. If you want individual checks, tell the server first. Before you order four Bloomin’ Onions, make sure your mates know you are going communal, and are cool with it.
L - Logic. Don’t forget it. If you know your friend Red just got laid off from the plant and is hard up on cash, don’t be pissed if he wants his own check when you go HAM on various ham plates (and also, this makes sure the rest of the table is not bound by one person’s budget). And no two situations are the same: If you are in a tiny but packed mom-and-pop with one server, try to put it all on one card. These situations are subjective, and you need to treat them as such. Common sense is the best way to assuage any problems. In life, and in checks. This is the golden rule of check-splitting.
I - iPhones, and by proxy apps like Venmo, have made it ridiculously easy for money to change hands -- so use ‘em. In previous decades, the issue with one person putting the whole check on their card might have been more severe. Imagine having to wait till the first of the month for the town savings and loan to open so your friends can withdraw a roll of silver dollars (assuming that’s how things used to work). Now you can pay your buddy back at the literal speed of light.
T -  Teetotalers must be heard and accommodated; this is an extension of the logic part, but it deserves its own slot as it is one of the most common gripes. Alcohol is a delicious, slippery lubricant that helps us talk to strangers, but it also ruins friendships. It’s expensive. And if you aren’t drinking, you probably don’t want to pay for everyone else's dranks. It's not really fair.
Ultimately, even the air-tight rubric of an expertly crafted acronym can't be universal. The rules of the restaurant world are not black and white: They’re more like a mashed potato cream color, with specks of brown, crispy skin tossed in to make things more exciting... even if they get stuck in your teeth sometimes. But that's why we have toothpicks!
The only true, mature way to tackle the check -- and actually, most adult problems involving other humans and money -- is a healthy spirit of compromise: the utilitarian toothpick of adult problems. This willingness to be malleable is far more mature than any half-baked stance you have on splitting. So use these rules as a general guideline, a primer. They are not doctrine. Your focus should rest on being open, being considerate, and thinking outside of yourself... even if it’s just for one meal.
In other words: Grow up, dummy!"

It's always a big deal when a new Whole Foods opens. With its legions of fans, the upscale grocery store sells the sorts of organic and pesticide-free products that New Yorkers have come to rely on to stock their tiny kitchens.
If the amount of people who attended the opening of the chain's newest 42,000-square-foot store located inside One Wall Street at 66 Broadway is of any indication, the new shop will be a very successful business move.
The store follows in the footsteps of the over ten other Whole Foods in Manhattan in terms of look, feel and product range: customers can expect the items sold on location to be free of the same 230 ingredients that are banned at other markets (including high-fructose corn syrup, aspartame and saccharin, among others). Cheese and meat specialists also abound on site, offering both traditional and more eclectic produce that is sure to delight all sorts of shoppers.
The new Whole Foods sits at the ground level of the historic One Wall Street building and, inside, patrons will immediately notice the Art Deco accents that pay homage to the space they're in. Parts of old elevator doors adorn the walls behind the self check-out counter, for example, while a vintage, golden mailbox sits at the foot of the escalator.
Usually serving Allegra coffee at all of its counters, this Whole Foods is testing out a local brand for the very first time. Shoppers are invited to grab a cup of java, a latte or an espresso from Brooklyn-based Partners Coffee at the cafe that sits right at the entrance to the store.
A ton of locally-made products are making their debut at the new downtown destination, including tomato sauce by Matriark, a New Jersey-based business that uses three million pounds of surplus tomatoes from a grower in Virginia to create its products, and CHKP, a plant-based yogurt that just recently launched.
One Wall Street is, mostly, a residential building, where some of the most expensive and opulent apartments in New York will be up for sale.
On the ground level, though, Whole Foods will share space with luxury health club and gym Life Time and Printemps, a high-end French department store that has chosen the location as the site of its first-ever store in the United States. To enter the latter destination, folks get to walk through the beautiful Red Room, a hidden art gem that has been closed to the public for years but will soon be accessible again.
Referred to by its moniker because of the interior red and gold mosaics that were designed by famous artist Hildreth Meière, the Red Room is a former private banking hall that was only available to the wealthiest clients of the bank (the building is also known as the Bank of New York Building).
Once Printemps debuts, you'll be able to take a walk through the space... perhaps before or after a shopping excursion at Whole Foods!"

https://www.eater.com/2015/6/19/8788487/washington-dc-southeastern-asian-dining-scene,Eater,"In the first spoonful of khao soi gai at Baan Thai in Washington D.C., I tasted muscle. Not actual flesh, though chicken stock certainly mingled in the broth of this curry noodle soup native to northern Thailand. I tasted brawn. Someone in the kitchen had pounded the hell out of lemongrass, ginger, fresh turmeric, and other spices to create a curry paste imbued with supernatural strength. It was electrical and alive. It infused every atom in the fiery liquid, layered with a pungent whomp of shrimp paste against the soothing sweetness of coconut milk. Braised chicken rested in a shallow pool of broth atop ropy noodles, garnished with sliced shallots (also an ingredient in the paste) and pickled mustard greens. One spritz of lime quickened every flavor. Fried noodles, a traditional adornment, rose from the far corner of the bowl like a tangle of wintry branches. Every other element of the dish instantly conjured the tropics.
My friend and I took alternate bites, marveling, and showered the server with so many questions that he eventually brought out the chef, Jeeraporn Poksupthong. She patiently fielded our guesses at ingredients (""Yes, there’s cardamom"") and offered up a few more insights. She seemed reluctant to disclose all her secrets, but pride twinkled in her eyes.
Baan Thai began as an alternate menu introduced last fall at a Japanese place known as Tsunami Sushi & Lounge. The same owners run a stalwart below it called Thai Tanic that offers the kinds of Americanized diminutions — the mild noodles, the coddling over-creamed curries — served in mass-appeal Thai restaurants for decades. Noticing a shift in tastes among younger generations of restaurant goers, the owners wanted to try an experiment: They enlisted Poksupthong to compose a menu of truer Thai standards, with the stratums of heat and complexity in tact. Word spread and customers soon swooned over chile-blazed sticky tapioca spheres stuffed with ground chicken and cradled in a romaine leaf, or herbaceous green curry bathing fish balls (spiced, ground mackerel) with eggplant and a nest of rice vermicelli. Astounded by the response, the owners officially renamed the restaurant Baan Thai earlier this year.
Boasting Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas, Andy Ricker’s Pok Pok empire in Portland, and the street-food pyrotechnics at Kris Yenbamroon’s Night + Market restaurants in Los Angeles, the West Coast can claim most of the credit for slowly shifting the country’s predilections around Thai cooking over the last fifteen years. Washington D.C., though, is the East Coast epicenter for more genuine-minded Thai cuisine. That holds especially true when including its suburb: At Thai Taste by Kob above Silver Spring, Maryland, for example, even the fried rice scorches with chiles and shrimp paste, though folding in a shredded omelet helps mitigate the burn.
In fact, for food lovers not intimate with our capital’s dining scene, the abundance of distinguished Southeast Asian restaurants in general might surprise. Restaurants opened by non-European immigrants have long been an unusually rich part of the mix in D.C. Growing up in Maryland in the eighties, I had my first experience of doro wat scooped by hand with squishy injera at one of the Ethiopian restaurants in the Adams Morgan neighborhood. Recently the Asian population has particularly grown throughout the metro area, up by sixty percent in the last decade. The ever-expanding options for faithful renditions of Thai, Lao, Vietnamese, and Filipino cuisines cooked by natives as well as non-native devotees reflect it.
To dive in, I headed to the most hyped of the lot: Little Serow, the basement family-style Thai restaurant run by Johnny Monis, whose fine-dining Komi resides upstairs in the same building. Little Serow holds 28 seats and doesn’t take reservations. I was warned to arrive well ahead of its 5:30 p.m. opening time if I wanted a table right away. It turns out that joining the queue at 5:10 didn’t qualify as early enough. ""Ooh, we just filled,"" said the hostess, smiling sympathetically at my two colleagues and me. ""We’ll call you when we have your table, but it’s looking like 7:30?""
Right, then: a detour. We grabbed the nearest cab and walked right into Thip Khao, a newcomer that spun off late last year from a Thai restaurant in Falls Church called Bangkok Golden that's often singled out for its auxiliary Lao menu. Thip Khao’s dapper setting (celery walls, dark hardwoods, woven baskets as objet d’art) doesn’t mean the food is diluted. On the contrary: Chef/owner Seng Luangrath, who hails from Laos, turns the flame thrower on her food. The cuisine shares many of the bright, herbal, aggressive qualities of Issan (northern Thai) cooking. Look for the menu that says ""Let’s go to the jungle!"" for the most extreme pleasures. The papaya salad looked innocent enough, but it went beyond hot: It was arson. Its juicy crunch satisfied against the darker savor of things like laab kai tok (a mix of poultry liver, heart, and skin with rice powder, cilantro, mint, chile, and lime) and awk, a dryer-style curry brambly with mustard greens and dill and loaded with vegetables.
It is a testament to the stamina of the human tastebuds that we could return to Little Serow and still appreciate our meal there. The drink list tempted in several unusual but uniformly successful directions: Rieslings, vermouths, hoppy and sour ales. Snakehead fish with tamarind and shrimp paste lashed out, but not with the venom of Thip Khao. It was easy to see why this place gets so much love. The staff engaged full. The food thrummed with Issan bluster but its highlight flavors stayed distinct and clarion: potent cilantro root added character to tofu; the sunny twang of lemongrass softened the murkiness of catfish. Mild pork ribs soaked in rum-like mekhong whiskey, the signature finale, felt like a relief. Who knew that gnawing on bones could effectively dampen capsicum’s fire?
Overt spice can be found on the Thai and Vietnamese menu at Doi Moi — which, like Baan Thai and Khip Tao, sits on 14th Street, one of D.C.’s most bustling restaurant rows — but the cooking is more restrained, friendlier to a wider audience. Doi Moi’s space revels in textures: white tiles and occasionally colorful ones, grainy woods, pebbly-looking floors. The most notable dishes, too, exulted in texture: fluffy fried rice sweet with crab, toothy sour Issan sausage surrounded by peanuts and cucumber slices, kee mao (stir-fried rice noodles) with a nice chew and a smoky whiff from the wok. Thai dishes leaned slightly stronger than the Vietnamese ones. Cha ca la vong for instance, a fish dish revved with turmeric, dill, fish sauce, and shrimp paste that’s named for a century-old restaurant in Hanoi, needed a silkier sauce and bolder hand with the spices. (For memorable Vietnamese in the metro area, try Rice Paper in Falls Church, Virginia.) Doi Moi certainly does right by vegetarians and vegans, who have a separate menu available on request.
As far as restaurants with mixed-culture menus go, I found brand-new Maketto in the city’s Atlas District more exhilarating. Erik Bruner-Yang made his local and national reputation on the bowls of silky tonkotsu ramen at Toki Underground; for three years he and his partners have been working on a project that houses a restaurant, retail shop, lounge, and coffee shop in one setting. The flow of Maketto’s sleek, Japanese-inspired space encourages lingering, if even just to wander to the second floor to scope out the coffee bar and the most popular design feature: a vending machine with entertainingly random items that include aspirin, black sharpies, phone chargers, cinnamon toothpaste, and magnum condoms.
Despite the many diversions, the food managed to pull focus. Bruner-Yang’s menu combines dishes from Cambodia and his native Taiwan. Pungent Khmer beef sausage hit the table with flaky scallion pancakes and an intriguing oyster omelet with gooey pockets created by arrowroot, a traditional Taiwanese addition that didn’t thrill the texture sensitive at my table. Best were the dishes engineered for sharing — a wagyu bao platter with greens, pickles, and hoisin for stuffing the spongy buns and flavoring the meat and, an early favorite, peppery Taiwanese fried chicken cutlets scattered with peppers and soaked in syrup, with milk bread underneath to absorb all the goodness.
The Southeast Asian culinary culture with the most rapidly emerging profile in D.C. looks to be Filipino.
Maketto’s magnetism is nudging two lesser-known cuisines into the mainstream, but the Southeast Asian culinary culture with the most rapidly emerging profile in D.C. looks to be Filipino. Few prominent restaurants in the U.S. spotlight the cooking of the Philippines; Qui in Austin is one important exception. Filipinos represent the largest Asian populations in Maryland’s Prince Georges and Charles counties that neighbor D.C., and at least five restaurants homing in on Pinoy cooking have recently opened or are in the works.
Among them is Purple Patch, in the eclectic Mount Pleasant neighborhood, which just launched in March. The restaurant slid in a burger and Caesar salad to their repertoire, but Filipino classics dominate the menu. They serve as the gentlest possible introduction to the Philippine’s slow-simmering amalgam of Chinese, colonial Spanish, and indigenous flavors. (The country spans 6,000 islands; pinning down one sweeping definition of its food is untenable.) Start with gratifying lumpia, the cigarillo-thin spring rolls stuffed with pork and beef and served with banana ketchup, a catchall Filipino condiment. Co-owner Patrice Cleary’s Filipino mother makes them for the restaurant. Cane vinegar gave the chicken adobo, arguably the cuisine’s most famous dish, a sweet-and-sour ping that American palates will appreciate. Another easygoing introduction: sinigang, a tender hunk of pork belly over rice in a lemony broth.
I trekked to Alexandria, Virginia, about 20 minutes outside of D.C., for bolder Filipino flavors in an unexpected location: the restored nineteenth-century warehouse that shelters elegant Restaurant Eve. Executive chef Cathal Armstrong owns the restaurant with his Filipino wife, Meshelle, and the couple has been slowly incorporating the foods of her heritage into the New American menu. In January, as an experiment, the kitchen switched solely to Filipino-focused prix fixe for a month. It was enough of a success that an Asian tasting menu is now a standard option.
Mine started with a slate board displaying Filipino surf and turf: a lacquered hunk of pork belly, a radish-strewn hamachi kinilaw zinged with puckery calamansi citrus, and a timbale of rice with a poached egg atop. Then the fiercer flavors: callos, a tripe stew, and a take on dinuguan, one of the more infamous Filipino dishes made with pork blood, here modified by using blood sausage (an Irish favorite, winking to Cathal Armstrong’s background) that pulled back on the funk but still delivered plenty of wallop. Shrimp in feisty Thai green curry traipsed into the mix. A coconut sorbet with rasberry granita and strawberries channeled the Filipino sundae called halo-halo and cooled the senses.
Mastering Eastern culinary traditions without debasing them with Western cleverness takes perception and discipline, but this kitchen seems capable of it. The Armstrongs recently announced they’d be opening an Asian restaurant in Southwest Washington D.C. in the next few years. Their flagship should make for elegant testing grounds in the meanwhile."

Fortunately, your friends at Eater are here to help: Life Coach is a series of simple guides to the arcane rituals of modern dining. Have a question or a quandary you’d like us to tackle? Drop Life Coach a line.
Dining with friends is truly one of life’s great pleasures — but who hasn’t had to endure a meal out with that one friend who insists on busting out a calculator to determine the exact cost of their appetizer and entree down to the cent? Or, perhaps you’ve had the unfortunate experience of throwing down a credit card for a birthday dinner of 15 people, only to be left with a hefty tab after a few people skimp on their share.
Mobile payment apps have greatly improved the ritual of splitting the check, but like anything involving friends and money, it can still be a precarious situation. Figuring out how to pay the tab at the end of the night need not be complicated, and no one should walk away irritated or lamenting their cheapskate friends. By remembering a few simple guidelines, you and your dining companions can focus on what truly matters, like Great British Bake Off spoilers and whether or not “cauliflower steak” is a term that should be legally allowed on menus.
If you have strong feelings about how the meal should be paid for — like if you’re not particularly hungry and don’t want to pay for anything other than the salad and water you’re ordering — speak up before anyone orders. Otherwise, your silence implies you’re fine with everyone’s food and drink going on one bill, with each diner being asked to contribute an equal amount to the total. On that note, it’s also helpful for your server if you let them know from the get-go whether you’ll be all together or on separate checks.
While a select few restaurants still adhere to an archaic “no split checks” policy, the vast majority now use a digital point-of-sales system that makes separating checks quite easy.
Some people may scoff at the idea of separate checks, but don’t let anyone make you feel like a cheapskate or a simpleton for not wanting to chip in on a combined bill. Separate checks are actually the perfect way to avoid the kind of hair-splitting that can come with trying to divvy up one combined bill: Everyone gets their own tab, plunks down their respective payments, and goes about their merry way, zero discussion required.
There’s also a limit to the amount of separate checks you can reasonably ask for: Four diners with separate checks is fine — maybe six if the restaurant isn’t super busy. Any more than that and you’re potentially becoming a real pain in your server’s ass. Note that some restaurants limit the number of ways they’ll split the check to two or three, because all that divvying up of menu items and printing multiple checks ties up your server’s precious time at the POS, which can really put a snag in front-of-house operations.
If you’re dining with five friends and agree to one combined bill, expect to chip in one-sixth of the bill — no more, no less. The notion that you somehow owe less because your entree was $12 cheaper than everyone else’s is not a hill worth dying on, and it is guaranteed to annoy the hell out of your fellow diners. Also, do you really want to be the person involved in a bout of calculator smashing at the end of the meal while everyone else is devouring the remainder of dessert?
It hardly needs to be said that in 2018, many people don’t carry cash at all; we are the obnoxious generation that swipes our debit cards for a pack of gum at the gas station. That being said, cash generally just complicates things when it comes to splitting the check, because even people who do keep cash in their wallet are highly unlikely to have exact change.
Instead, most check-splitting among friends these days seems to occur via mobile app: Venmo is perhaps the most ubiquitous, but there’s also Paypal, the Cash app, Chase Quickpay, and numerous other options. Venmo is particularly useful because users can include a stream of emojis along with their payment (how better to let your friend know that this $23.57 is payment for tacos and beer?). If you’re the friend that’s been entrusted with plunking down your Chase Sapphire for the entire meal, Venmo also enables you to simply send payment requests to your friends, which can help cut off any potential quibbling over amounts.
If splitting the bill with certain friends always becomes a huge headache that creates tension at the table, consider ways of avoiding the situation altogether — such as choosing a counter-service spot where everyone can order and pay individually ahead of time (Shake Shack actually has a pretty decent wine selection). And if all else fails, just dine solo while staring into your cell phone — it’s the millennial way!

The East Village offers something for everyone whether you’re hungry for vegan Sichuanese or pierogi. While going out to restaurants and bars in 2020 is different—there’s no indoor eating or drinking for the time being—outdoor dining is all the rage. Luckily, the East Village continues to offer its wide array of cuisines you can enjoy on New York’s sidewalks and streets.
Hanoi House from Stephen Starr alums Ben Lowell and Sara Leveen is a perennial favorite with its nod to traditional Vietnamese dishes with some cheffy touches, from a 16-hour broth for the classic beef pho to the filet mignon in the shaking beef. Dining outdoors is not uncommon in Vietnam, and we’re happy to have this option here.
While the space is gorgeous, and the cocktails are complex (Party Lobster: blanco tequila, mezcal, Campari, watermelon, lime, fermented habanero and garlic) it is all entirely amusing and accessible—and available to go these days.
We love some fun kitsch you can find at Indian restaurants in the East Village but for the Instagrammable shots, we’ll leave it to the spots on First Avenue and Sixth Street. At Baar Baar, you’ll find plenty of outdoor seats to enjoy modern-yet-authentic takes on Indian food served in a fun atmosphere.
The new-ish restaurant from the team behind the East Village favorite Thursday Kitchen is just as intriguing (save room for a Pop Rock dessert) as its original outpost. Here, tapas are influenced by chef Kyungmin Kay Hyun’s travels to Spain and South America as well as her Korean heritage.
With the opening of Kindred, the team behind Ruffian now has a larger stage for its smartly curated selection of natural wines. There, the small plates of pastas, salads and bar snacks are complemented by an impressive roster of orange wines from Italy and Slovenia."

https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/mta-limited-edition-notorious-big-metrocards,Thrillist,"On May 21, New York City celebrated the King of New York's birthday. The late rapper The Notorious B.I.G. would've turned 50, and the city came up with many initiatives to honor the beloved New Yorker. One of them was limited-edition MetroCards.
The MTA released 50,000 subway cards featuring the world-famous photo of Biggie wearing a crown, and New Yorkers lined up for hours to try and snag one at four select Brooklyn stations. The location choice of Brooklyn is a nod to Biggie's life and career. The rapper grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and never failed to rep his neighborhood in his songs.
Those who missed out or came late to the party can still get them, but they'll have to pay up. A few Biggie MetroCards are still in circulation, but fans will have to turn to eBay to buy one. Most of them are listed for a reasonable or somewhat affordable price, which can range from $55 for a scratched card to $75 for a laminated version, Curbed reports. The highest seller, though, set the bar much higher. A Biggie MetroCard is currently listed for $4,899 which, according to the post, includes expedite shipping. If you decide to go for it, you have to be sure of your investment, as the seller doesn't accept returns.
Biggie's birthday celebrations took over the city on the rapper's birthday weekend. To further honor the hip-hop legend, the Empire State Building lit up in red and white on May 21, and featured a crown rotating around its mast to celebrate Notorious B.I.G's multi-platinum album Ready to Die, which featured world-famous hits like ""Big Poppa"" and ""Unbelievable."" On the same day, to honor the born-and-raised Brooklyn star, Barclays Center presented a montage video of Biggie's most famous records above the stadium's entrance."
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/this-secret-bookstore-in-greenpoint-is-hidden-behind-a-bodega-081722,Timeout,"The only thing we love more than a bookstore is one that's hidden behind a very New York-like facade, making the space that much more magical. A new such destination has just opened in Greenpoint: Burnt Books is a vintage bookstore set up inside a bodega called Green Discount Corp at 1014 Manhattan Avenue by Green Street.
To find it, head to the address, look for the graffiti-like sign that reads ""BURNT BOOKS"" on the sidewalk by the bodega's entrance, walk to the back and get ready to purchase some vintage paperbacks.
Although finding Burnt Books on Google is nearly impossible (hence us giving you the exact address and directions!), the store's Instagram account makes the endeavor that much more accessible.
The account is filled with pictures of the sorts of titles you'll find on premise, including Ed Noon's The Living Bomb, Frank Kane's Due or Die, Kate Wilhelm's Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang and Norbert Wiener's Cybernetics. Coffee table books, works of nonfiction and travel guides make appearances as well.
As reported by Eater, the shop was set up by one Jason Mojica, the owner of nearby comic book destination Hey Kids! Comics. According to the outlet, Mojica initially sought to open a standalone used book shop but ""couldn't afford two rents"" so he instead partnered with the bodega's owner in an effort to ""drum up more business"" for the both of them. Mission accomplished, it seems.
Can you tell how excited we are about a new bookshop?"

The pop-up bar, appropriately dubbed The Alice, has made its way city to city—from Denver and San Francisco to Sydney, Australia—and is now arriving in New York City to bring a little boozy magic to the Big Apple.
Moving into Upper West Side restaurant and event space Pekarna NYC, The Alice brings you into a whimsical fairytale land with ""enchanted"" teapot cocktails and ""eat me"" cakes, the latter of which won't cause the same side effects Alice experienced in the story. We promise.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/affordable-travel-destinations-memorial-day-weekend,Thrillist,"You might still be recovering from these late March cold snaps, so the idea of making plans for summer 2023 might feel a bit silly. But prepared or not, time is passing quickly and Memorial Day weekend is quickly approaching.

https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/new-years-eve-restaurants-nyc,Theinfatuation,"With the new year approaching, you’ve probably started planning out all of the ways you’re going to become a better person next year. But first, you need to figure out where you’re going to undo your entire life the night before, and what you’re going to eat while doing it.
There are plenty of great places to have your last meal of 2023. You’ll find a mix of early seatings and spots that are open extra late on this list of ticketed, prix-fixe meals, as well as a whole lot of champagne toasting. And because tickets can sell out fast, we've also given you options for regular, a la carte dinners at cool restaurants that will actually be open.
In a world where the mere mention of “small plates” induces involuntary eye-rolls, Place des Fêtes still manages to get us excited about their particular brand of petit dining. From December 28 to midnight on the 31st, the Clinton Hill wine bar is cooking up some decadent specials—things like grilled carabineros, lobster with sauce américaine, ribeye with perigord truffle—and an extra-fancy selection of wine. They’ll have seatings as late as 10:30pm on the night of, so you can ring in the New Year with an abundance of champagne and caviar. Reservations open on 12/6.
Are you the sort of person who welcomes the New Year by doing a bunch of shots? Or a new kind of person we made up—who welcomes 2024 by slamming a celebratory scotch egg before the clock strikes 12? Lord’s will be serving their incredible lamb scotch eggs, as part of their a la carte menu of British classics, alongside some festive specials. The Greenwich Village restaurant feels like a cross between a Hogwarts professor’s office and a trendy bar, so it’s one of your coziest options for the night. Reservations are live, with  details on Instagram. If you’re more into seafood, Lord’s sister restaurant Dame is also hosting a dinner (info here).
If your resolutions involve going greener next year, consider starting things off early with Avant Garden’s $125 prix fixe. The East Village vegan restaurant is known for things like artichoke toast, and big, meaty chunks of roasted hen of the woods, so we’re sure their six-course, special occasion menu won’t disappoint. And the space, with a hodgepodge of suede, shrubbery, antique wood and vintage fixtures, looks like a speakeasy for fairies and elves. All guests get tickets to their after-party at the Poison Ivy Club until 2am, so your whole night is covered. Reserve a spot in the bar or main dining room here.
If you want to have dinner on the earlier side, Artesano is doing one 5pm seating for their $150 prix-fixe menu. Before you get to party-hopping, stop by for beautiful plates of Peruvian food, decorated with purees, sauces, and other accouterments that each provide a new layer of flavor. With some live music and plenty of pisco sours on hand, you can get your evening started somewhere lowkey before ramping it up for the rest of the night. Make your reservation here.
A good New Year’s Eve involves unabashed hedonism, and that includes everything you put into your body that night. Indulge in it all at Le Crocodile, which has plenty of foie gras, truffle, and lobster in its $165 prix-fixe menu. Located at the bottom of a Williamsburg hotel, the space is borderline palatial, with high ceilings, arched windows, and waiters strolling around in white jackets serving champagne. It’s the perfect place to go all-out with a sparkly outfit. Seatings are from 5-10pm, in either the Cellar or the Dining Room. More info here.
KBBQ restaurant Cote is well-versed in throwing a good party. At $275 for the 5pm seating, and $295 for the 8pm, it’s one of the pricer prix fixes on this list. But with its fancy grills, high-quality meat, and sharply dressed servers, you’ll be getting your money’s worth. The bar will be open later, and you should reserve in advance. The Flatiron space already looks like a nightclub, so it’s the ideal setting for your midnight champagne toast.
There’s been a lot of fanfare around Foxface Natural lately, thanks to their quirky small plates of things like kangaroo tartare and “reassembled eggs.” We don’t know what the East Village restaurant is cooking up for New Year’s, but we’re betting it’s going to be a conversation starter. Tickets are $200 (champagne toast included), and wine pairings are extra. Grab tickets here.
You can get your Gatsby on at a 1920s speakeasy themed party at Grimm Artisanal Ales in East Williamsburg. This spacious tap room has plenty of room for dancing to live music all night, and one of the best rooftops in the neighborhood. And they obviously know a thing or two about drinking, so expect a great selection of beer, cocktails, and Physica wines, as well as light bites provided by their in-house, Connecticut style pizza joint, Lala’s Brooklyn Apizza. Follow their website or Instagram for prices and tickets.
Potluck Club is a Cantonese-American spot that sits on the border of Chinatown and the LES. The fun dining room has faux movie theater displays that also dispense fortune cookies, and a bar lit-up with a sign that says “Here for a good time, not a long time.” Dishes like salt-and-pepper chicken served with chive biscuits and chili crisp jam are special enough for a night out, while also being the kind of things you want to eat every day. As you enjoy the Dole Whip soft serve topped with a bolo bao crumble for dessert, smile about the fact that you're nowhere near Times Square.
Thanks to Sami’s, Astoria can claim some of NYC’s best Afghan food. Their lamb and beef kofta kebabs are worth a trip, and the vinegary leek aushak is a must-order. (You can get a vegetarian version without the lamb gravy.) With large parties sharing big platters of food,  you might feel like you're crashing someone's family function here. This place is perfect for  all your friends who would rate ""putting on a bowtie"" dead-last on the list of things they'd want to do on New Year's.
The quintessential UWS restaurant Old John’s Luncheonette reopened in the same 67th Street location, but with a new name and a spruced-up dining room with tons of booths. Come here when you don't feel like changing out of whatever loungewear you're in and want a thick, satisfying burger and a few martinis. This is also a perfect choice if you're looking for a place to bring your children on New Year's because there's a kids menu with grilled cheese and lots of desserts (including homemade ice cream). Despite its revamp, Old John’s has old-school charm—jazz playing over the speakers, staff who have been working there for years—and egg creams at the ready.
The Ops team is behind Leo, a casual and spacious restaurant in Williamsburg, which stands out because it’s not only one of the best pizza spots in the city, but it’s also easy to get into. Granted, New Year's isn't just any day of the year, so we'd recommend that you make a reservation instead of trying to walk in. Leo's tangy sourdough crust is somewhere between a flatter, slightly crispy New York style and a poofy, chewy Neapolitan, and they also have a great caesar salad and soft serve.
You could eat at a ""fun"" spot that has strobe lights and blasts music, but maybe you're in the mood for something more relaxing. If so, head to Smith & Wollensky, a fixture in Midtown East for over 40 years. It isn’t trying to be anything other than a classic and reliable steakhouse, and that’s exactly what it is. You’ll see white tablecloths, wine bottles stored everywhere, and servers wheeling out plates on carts throughout the large, two-story space. We love the massive juicy prime rib with an intense beefy flavor, but the bone-in, picture-perfect dry-aged filet is even better.
Hwa Yuan is a reboot of a popular Chinatown restaurant that opened in the '60s and closed in the '80s. There are multiple floors with lots of big tables covered in crisp white tablecloths, so it's an ideal choice if you want to ring in the new year with almost everyone you know. Share a whole crispy Peking duck, and don't forget to start with some pork soup dumplings and cold sesame noodles.
Instead of kissing a stranger in front of other strangers, celebrate the year that was 2023 with olive oil cake at L’Artusi in the West Village. Unlike a lot of rustic downtown Italian spots, the decor is modern, with upholstered seating and gray tile floors. Eating here on any day of the year feels special, so it’s a good choice for meals on actually special occasions. Get one of their top-notch pastas, a crudo, and the roasted chicken in a sauce that tastes like pure brown butter.
This Thai restaurant is a Woodside classic, and, after all these years, it’s still a good place to share a large plate of softshell crab with a table of your very best friends (or a few people who you just kinda like) for a very casual, and early New Year's Eve. The large menu doesn’t stick to one region of Thailand, and you should order a bunch of seafood as well as fragrant, fall-apart tender pork leg. Keep in mind that this place is cash-only, and it closes at 8pm.
Nonono is owned by the same people as Ariari, but instead of Korean seafood, this place specializes in Japanese food—specifically yakitori. With exposed pipes and ducts, this Nomad spot feels like eating in someone's industrial loft. Order a ton of different skewers and a few larger plates from the binder-sized menu. Everything comes out quickly, so don’t be surprised when your meal suddenly starts to look more like a banquet. It is New Year’s Eve, after all.
Get a table at this charming Cobble Hill spot with lots of exposed brick for a New Year's feast of Moroccan-Spanish tapas. We love the pine nut almond gazpacho with raw scallops and Galician octopus submerged in citrusy olive oil, but you’re bound to have a memorable meal here whatever you order. Just know that the portions aren't huge, so it can get a little pricey if you're very hungry. Good thing your new year’s resolution to spend less money won't start until the next day.
Really good barbecued meat on a stick is hard to beat. At Dhom, a Lao spot in the East Village, they've pretty much mastered the form. They have two types of skewers: hanger steak and chicken thigh, both marinated in a sweet-and-smoky sauce. Get them with a side of sticky rice—the garlicky chili sauce will make your lips buzz. Pad out your order with spring rolls and a crunchy coconut rice salad. The food here is snacky and designed for drinking, which we suspect you might be doing a bit of on New Year's.
We're into the cornbread and fried chicken at this Harlem restaurant, and there are other Southern staples like fried catfish and shrimp and grits on the menu. But you come here mainly because few restaurants in this city feel as alive. The bar area is mobbed, the DJ is spinning funk and soul, and people generally appear to be having a blast. You basically have a ready-made New Year's Eve party as soon as you step in the door.
Cafe Spaghetti serves simple, quality Italian food, and the look of the restaurant fits right in with every other place in Carroll Gardens—there's a very nice backyard with a garden and a baby blue Vespa. Start with the cacio e pepe arancini (their best appetizer), then get the spaghetti pomodoro with tomato-and-basil sauce on handmade pasta. It tastes like your everyday spaghetti if it went through an episode of Rustic Rehab on HGTV.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/popeyes-chicken-nuggets-vs-sandwich-taste-test,Thrillist,"We've tried damn near every iteration of the fast food chicken sandwich in our journalistic pursuit to find the greatest, but nothing has managed to topple Popeyes' sandwich. There's just something about the Louisiana-style chain's version that can't seem to be outdone by competitors.
Then, earlier this month, Popeyes made an announcement that felt like it was a long time coming. The menu is getting another crispy addition: chicken nuggets—nearly two years after the sandwich's sell-out debut. Here's the real kicker, though. The new nugs are said to have the same ""quality and flavor of [Popeyes'] famous Chicken Sandwich""—according to Popeyes itself.
Naturally, we had one task... put that bold claim to the test. We tried the all-new Popeyes Chicken Nuggets just to see how they would stack up against the fan-favorite sammie.
Popeyes said it's using the exact same recipe for its nuggets as it does for its record-breaking sandwich, with a ""special flour and batter system"" that creates a crispy, crunchy fried chicken texture. Like the sandwich, the white meat chicken is hand-seasoned, breaded in buttermilk, and freshly fried. Basically, it's the same recipe and process just served in a different format.
The Popeyes Chicken Nuggets are officially hitting stores across the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico on Thursday, July 27.
Popeyes hit the nail on the head with its latest creation and, hey, we're admittedly not surprised. The chicken is fried to perfection with juicy, tender white meat. It's seasoned with the tiniest hint of a kick, which you can thank that famous Louisiana-style spice blend for. Like the Popeyes chicken sandwich, these nuggets have the potential to push other fast food chains to up their game—this time with their chicken nugget offerings. At least, we hope so. A chicken nuggets arms race means we'll all benefit from better nugget options across the board.
While the chicken nuggets boast the same quality as our beloved chicken sandwich (seasoning, crisp breading, and juicy meat!), you are getting a different experience. You're missing the layers of sauce, zesty pickles, and the brioche bun, so don't expect the exact same flavor experience.
However, you are getting lots of sauce options because the nugs were designed to go with Popeyes' lineup of nine staple sauces, which includes Blackened Ranch, Buttermilk Ranch, Mardi Gras Mustard, Sweet Heat, and Bayou Buffalo. You can opt for one or two or take a cue from us and sample a new sauce with each nugget. Who doesn't like a little variety?
Nope. Not yet, at least. The nuggets are available in classic style only right now, but, of course, you can turn up the heat with your sauce choice.
It's a matter of preference. With the nuggets, you're getting the same crispy, tender chicken as the sandwich, so it's just a matter of how you like it dressed: in bite-sized, dippable pieces or dressed to the nines atop a buttery brioche bun. Your call. You can't go wrong."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/most-expensive-world-travel-destinations,Thrillist,"Traveling can be a phenomenal rush, but you know what isn’t so great? Coming back from vacation and seeing your bank account after a trip. Personally, money spent on travel is always money well spent, but I would be lying if I told you that, at times, I wish I had been a little more financially conservative.
There are ways to tackle that, to make sure you enjoy your trip to the fullest while not going broke in the process. For example, picking a smart destination is a great start. The team at FloridaPanhandle.com, the travel brand that promotes the region of the same name, has got your back on that. They analyzed data from over 100 popular vacation destinations and created a list of the most expensive locations in the world—so if you're thinking about visiting one of these spots, you know what you're walking into.
To come up with the results, the site took into account a variety of factors. In addition to gathering data around accommodations and average rates, they also looked at average costs for daily transportation, top three most popular attractions, food, and flights.The absolute winner in the most expensive category was Gustavia, Saint Barthélemy, where the total cost of a single day for one person averages at a whopping $1,852—and that doesn't even include flights. According to findings, a roundtrip flight from a popular airport costs an average $2,772. The average daily meal cost is $58, and the average daily accommodation rate is pretty pricey too at $1,700 per person. If you do decide to visit, you'll be pleased to know that top attractions are free, since they're all nature-based.
For the world's second most expensive travel destination, you'll have to travel to Europe. Gstaad, Switzerland is a pretty popular winter locale, and while the scenery is breathtaking, so are the prices. Hotels are, on average, from $1,316 to $1,841 for your nightly rate, and you should expect to spend around $177 on average for daily food. On top of all that, you should also consider adding flights, which can cost an average $1,281 if flying from a major US airport.
The bronze medal goes to a US destination, but once you learn where it is, you won't find the results too surprising. Aspen, Colorado is famous for being one of the most luxurious and expensive ski towns in the world, and prices there are known to be sky-high. The average nightly rate for a hotel room is $1,385, and you'll have to add to it all the general attractions and transportation costs, which can make your expenses increase dramatically. Plus, flights aren't exactly cheap either—you should expect to pay an average $770 per roundtrip ticket from select major airports.
Take a look at the map below outlining all the most expensive travel destinations in the world.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/mta-survey-best-worst-nyc-subway-lines,Thrillist,"New York is a city of public transportation, but some subway lines are definitely better than others.
In June, 175,000 subway riders and 47,000 bus riders were asked about their satisfaction with NYC's public transport. According to the recent findings of the MTA's Spring 2022 Bi-Annual Customer Satisfaction and Travel Survey, New Yorkers particularly dislike the D train, giving the line a satisfaction rate of barely 40%. The A, C, and E lines didn't win too many praises, either, as only 41% of respondents said they were happy with the service.
Brooklynites can celebrate a bit. This spring's survey crowned the L train as New Yorkers' favorite, although it still only attracts a 53% satisfaction rating. The G and the Q trains earned silver and bronze medals, with respective ratings of 52% and 51%. Just below that is the 7 train, which follows the winners very closely with a 50% satisfaction rating.
It is worth noting that New Yorkers are even fonder of the shuttle trains at 42nd Street, Franklin Avenue, and the Rockaways, as well as the Staten Island Railway. The rating for these services range from 52% to 67%, with their short distances likely making them more reliable for passengers.
Overall, data shows that general satisfaction with NYC's subway system is only 48%. Among New Yorkers, buses have a tendency to beat the subway in rider satisfaction. Local, limited, and select bus routes flaunt a 63% rating, while express buses dominate the charts with 76% satisfaction.
Officials said that the survey is the best way to implement renovations and changes in the public transportation system to ensure New Yorkers have a seamless experience.
""The customer satisfaction survey shows our customers are finding their experience using all modes of mass transit to be better overall,"" MTA Acting Chief Customer Officer Shanifah Rieara said in an official statement. ""New Yorkers are letting us know what they like and what they feel needs work, and we appreciate their participation by taking the survey. We will do everything we can to make our customers feel most comfortable whether they are using the subway, buses, and the commuter rails.""
Recently, the MTA has been implementing important modifications to select subway lines to make the commute easier and faster. In July, the 2, 3, 4, and 5 lines started running at higher speeds, saving time for almost 900,000 commuters."

Hale and Hearty, the soup and sandwich chain popular amongst New York's office workers, has suddenly closed all of its New York locations, leaving fans puzzled, to say the least.
The reasons behind the unexpected shutdowns are unknown, although they might be temporary, The New York Post reports. One of the theories circulating is that the soup purveyor is going through some internal renovations and a rebrand, and that ""now hiring"" signs that were posted on some of the stores' windows before the closings are an indication of changes to come.
The shutdowns affect all of the New York locations, which include 16 stores across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island. Thrillist tried to reach out for comment but received no answer, and the ""Contact Us"" box on Hale and Hearty's website redirects to a ""Page Not Found"" message."

It appears that everyone actually is drinking espresso martinis—which is why an entire festival dedicated to the cocktail seems like the next logical step.
Coffee liquor brand Mr Black is seizing the opportunity, officially bringing its iconic Espresso Martini Fest to the United States for the very first time on May 16th through the 22nd. The event originally debuted in Australia back in 2016, setting up shop in London a few years later and now reaching this side of the Atlantic.
During the week-long festival, New Yorkers will get to order $12 Espresso Martinis at all types of bars across town.

This year, SantaCon will take place on December 10, and the event kicks off at 10 am. According to the map, the starting point is in Midtown, specifically at Broadway and 40th Street. The party will then open up to a multitude of venues, clubs, and bars, most of which are located across Midtown Manhattan. But watch out: Some East Village and Union Square locations are on the map, too.

https://www.thrillist.com/drink/washington-dc/washington-dc-sunday-funday-10-spots-to-day-drink-in-dc,Thrillist,"Turn laundry, gym, and call-your-dad day into an adventure that can transport you to far-off lands like New England, Spain, and wherever a Margaritaville still operates. All it takes is the right amount of day drinking and a festive atmosphere. We’ve rounded up some old favorites and fresh picks for your next Sunday Funday.
Union MarketThe signature silver bean of a bar that produces some of the best frozen drinks in the city is now open outside Union Market. Find it by looking for the NFL-grade turf, lawn games, flip cup table, and buzzed clientele holding sticky summer shandies made from beer, lemonade, and fresh ginger. Suburbia offers 10 beers on tap plus two draft cocktails and buckets of beer whenever they’re open, but Sundays are special. That’s when they bust out experimental Bloody Mary cocktails and sell them two-for-one. Suburbia opens Sundays at 11am.
SW WaterfrontCantina Marina’s Margaritaville atmosphere means you’ll feel more like you’re on vacation and less like you’re putting off errands. The guilt subsides even further when your first ""Escalade Margarita"" arrives. That’s the frozen margarita that comes with a mini bottle of Grand Marnier, just because. Another bonus to Sunday Funday? Corona-ritas are only $10. Bring the pup and tackle some Super Nachos by the water. Open Sundays at 11:30am.
14th StreetUsually the clock has to strike 6pm to enjoy 2 Birds, 1 Stone. That’s no longer the case on Sundays, when the doors swing open at 3pm for what they call ""6 ways 2 Sunday."" Six cocktails from Adam Bernbach are on offer -- several acknowledge you’re drinking during daylight, like the michelada and Irish coffee. Bring a group of Sunday Funday friends and split the Airmail-in-Carafe ($34), which contains dark rum, sparkling wine, honey, lime, and bitters.
TrinidadEverything is intense at Bardo Brewpub in Northeast. It’s gargantuan in size, and the beer list reads like a quirky novel. A good Sunday Funday session beer is the Australian-style Bunbaberg Ginger Beer, because it’s boosted with pounds of fresh ginger instead of hops. Bardo is also obsessed with aging beers in chestnut oak. Work your way through the rotating selection of 16 drafts starting at 1pm on Sundays. Note that Bardo could be much bigger by summer’s end. The team behind the brewpub is gearing up to open a two-acre beer garden and dog park near Nationals Park.
U StreetGetting time on the Vinoteca courtyard bocce court means you’re practically Sunday Funday royalty. Everyone sipping amari spritzes and eyeing the court wants to be you. But they’re not, because you promptly arrived at 11am when the court opens on Sundays. Relish in that as you throw a few in between bites of fancy dogs and pitchers of sparkling sangria. This year’s grill line-up includes duck sausage topped with slaw and Korean chili mayo and a Columbian-style dog topped with grilled pineapple dubbed ""Miss Universe.""
14th StreetThe weather’s not going to bring it's A-game every week, so make sure to cue up some rainy-day retreats. Black Jack, for example, goes on happy hour pricing all day Sundays from 3-10pm. Think $7 pizza and burgers and $10 buckets of beer all throughout the afternoon. The best deal, however, is the $25 bucket of fried chicken, bacon-braised greens, spicy coleslaw, and jalapeño corn muffins. Having a picnic in a bar means no busted tan lines or ants, and the Nats game will probably be on.
U StreetThis place is a hipster bingo card: can beer, Mason jars, local sausage, Narragansett lager, pickles, and bar food with adorable names (""swatchos,"" anyone?). That being said, it can be a low-key Sunday-hang that’s only a fraction less crowded than Dacha or Garden District. In addition to the swine-topped nachos, try the half-smoke that hails from nearby 13th Street Meats. Open Sundays at 1pm.
Dupont CircleYou, your swim trunks, and a cocktail belong on the roof of the newly renovated Embassy Row Hotel. Sure, you have to pay $25 for a day pass, but all will be forgiven after your first hour of lounging in luxury with a view. The bar opens at 11am Sundays, and they’ll serve drinks and snacks off the new Station Kitchen & Cocktails menu. If you want to wait it out, roof access is free after 5pm. Just no ticking people off in the cabanas by doing your best cannonball.
Capitol HillStart Sunday Funday off with Hank’s ""Hangover Juice,"" which will fix the fact that last night ended with Fireball. It combats a thumping headache with rum, falernum, carrot, orange, coconut water, and cayenne. Then you’ll be ready for mix-and-match bottomless drinks until 4pm for $15. Nosh on lobster rolls, popcorn shrimp, Bloody Mary oyster shooters, and more to curate a Cape Cod-like afternoon. Both the restaurant and The Eddy Bar open at 11am on Sundays.
Navy YardThis is your Sunday Funday option if you accidentally bought too many $14 cocktails on 14th St last night, because it’s dirt cheap. The Spanish import boasts a menu with 100 (duh) mini-sandwiches priced at $1.50-$3.00 each. Nibble on them on the sunny patio while kicking off a serious sangria session. Five types are available by-the-mug for $4, or pitcher for $10, and buckets of beer are just as cheap. It's open Sundays at 11am.
Sign up here for our daily DC email and be the first to get all the food/drink/fun in town."
https://www.eater.com/2020/4/17/21224994/christina-tosis-baking-club-is-the-best-thing-on-instagram-for-families,Eater,"Since the stay-at-home order started for us, the same day we moved from Los Angeles to Austin, there have been few things upon which my eight-year-old son and I can agree. From how much screen time he should get, whether or not he still needs to practice his handwriting, and even the importance of not riding his bike in the middle of the street (“Mom, the cars can’t hit me because of social distancing”), it’s safe to say in the age of quarantine, we haven’t exactly seen eye to eye. But then, #bakingclub came along.
I’ve baked with Cooper before, and despite some disagreements about frosting to cake ratios and whether his little brother should be allowed to participate, it’s typically an activity that brings us both joy. At one point when he was a toddler, I even dreamt of opening my own bakery; I now chalk that idea up to postpartum hormones. When I saw that Tosi, whom I came to love after watching her episode of Chef’s Table, was starting her quarantine baking club on Instagram, something sparked for me. Could we do this, he and I? Would it ease the daily tension? I figured at the very least I’d be able to say we did math and science for the day, and maybe get a cookie or two out of it. Little did I know that Tosi and her #bakingclub would become the glue holding our lives together.
My son knows Tosi not as a James Beard award-winning pastry chef, but rather as one of the judges on MasterChef Junior, a show perfectly suited for her warmth and positivity. So when I introduced the idea of doing #bakingclub with him, he was on board. She was familiar, knowledgeable, and because of her, we were going to have dessert for the first time in a week.
And so we began. For those who’re unfamiliar with #bakingclub, here’s how it works: Each afternoon Tosi posts a set of ingredients for the next day. Flour, salt, eggs, sugar, and butter are predictable mainstays. There are also wild cards thrown into the mix. Cereal, potato chips, ramen noodles, and grape jelly have made appearances, always leaving us rife with anticipation for what the next #bakingclub creation will be. And then, like clockwork, at 2 pm EST the following day, there she is.
She greets us with a dance, to the beat of the day’s playlist, which she also puts on Spotify. Madonna, Dolly Parton, Survivor, The Beach Boys… each day a different mix as we gather our ingredients and wash our hands while singing happy birthday to some of her followers. In the hands of someone else, the novelty may have worn off after the first couple of days. But with Tosi, that’s not the case. In fact, as the days go on, #bakingclub has become our not-so-secret ingredient for what she calls the secret to life: “always having something to look forward to.” And judging by the numbers, I’d say we’re not alone.
On day four of baking club I noted her Instagram following was hovering at 393,000 followers. Just 11 days later, she had 408,000 (and counting). It’s not only the recipes, which have proven to be delightfully simple and always delicious (save for a savory day when making tortillas fell a bit, well, flat, in my household). It’s not just the consistency of her process: ingredients, music, recipe, baked goods. It’s not just her over-the-top adorable dog, Butter, who typically makes daily appearances — though she certainly helps.
She shows up everyday, enthusiastic to make  the most of our time together, as if there’s nowhere else she’d rather be. She reminds us that it’s okay if we don’t have all the ingredients; there are always swaps to be made, it doesn’t have to be perfect. It’s the way she bebops around her kitchen, looking as precious as a grown woman possibly can in overalls while being decidedly not precious about her baking.
It’s been a long time since a public figure has brought me this kind of comfort. I was a senior at NYU in 2001 and lived just blocks away from where the Twin Towers fell. I remember how my roommate and I would wearily navigate each day as best we could. Some days we’d go to class, some days we wouldn’t. Some days we’d cry, some days we wouldn’t. But every night, we’d watch the Late Show with David Letterman, finding comfort and security in the way he navigated the fear and uncertainty of the time with a careful mix of humor, compassion, and his own raw emotion. While the COVID-19 pandemic and 9/11 aren’t exactly comparable, I’m finding similar relief in watching and baking along with Tosi. She’s giving us something reliable when the world is anything but.
I imagine that, as the days drag on, my son and I won’t magically start agreeing on how best to spend them. But I do have hope that he’ll eventually look back on this quarantine and think about our time together in the kitchen, dancing and baking our way through the 2 o’clock hour with Tosi and the rest of the #bakingclub."
https://www.timeout.com/usa/news/book-an-epic-little-mermaid-inspired-stay-in-malibu-053023,Timeout,"Calling all The Little Mermaid superfans: now’s your chance to spend a night in a Malibu Beach house inspired by the under-the-sea world of the beloved movie.

To celebrate the release of the new live-action movie in theaters, Disney and Booking.com have partnered up to offer this one-of-a-kind overnight stay that will fully immerse you into the world of The Little Mermaid.

https://www.thrillist.com/eat/new-york/michelin-star-restaurants-in-nyc-cheapest-new-york-options,Thrillist,"The Michelin brand is alternately known for quality tires, a cuddly mascot, and one of the most coveted accolades in the service industry, depending on your kink. The French rubber manufacturer first entered the ratings racket over a century-and-a-half ago in a bid to sell more tires. Since then, the anonymously curated honor -- one star for good, two for excellent, and three for exceptional -- has struck love and loathing in the hearts of chefs all over the world.
Michelin-starred restaurants are, with few exceptions, expensive. A typical dinner at some of the guide’s top-tiered eateries in New York can run hundreds of dollars per person. And, after a month of NYC Restaurant Week deals, you’ll be accustomed to eating better for less. Depending on what time you choose to eat or where you sit, a Michelin-approved meal can actually be within reach. We did the math and found 15 spots where you can eat extravagantly and even have enough money left over for a drink.
It is possible to indulge in Eleven Madison Park without a reservation or a trust fund -- provided you can snag one of six seats at the bar. Last year’s renovation truncated the drop-in space, and chef Daniel Humm’s à la carte menu remains succinct. The refreshed lounge is as luxe as ever, and the tiny bar affords an opportunity for slightly less-monied New Yorkers to catch a glimpse and a taste of the best restaurant in the world. Mix and match the prawn, the crab salad, the honey and lavender glazed duck, or the black and white cookies and sample one of the city’s most expensive menus for around $100.
Eat well, do good, and save money -- that sums up the City Harvest lunch at chef Eric Ripert's revered French restaurant. Available weekdays at Le Bernardin's lofty front lounge, the three courses not only offer a budget-friendly taste of Ripert's award-winning seafood preparations (ingredients change weekly), but $5 from every meal also gets donated to the menu's namesake nonprofit.
At $68 for two courses, lunch at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Central Park gem feels like a downright steal when compared to the $148 dinner (it's a whopping $238 for the tasting of JG signatures). Diners will find many of the same premium dishes, too, like yellowfin tuna ribbons, spicy peekytoe crab salad, or, for an extra $12, four small themed desserts (chocolate, tropical, etc.).
After longtime executive chef Gabriel Kreuther left to open his eponymous restaurant (which received a one-star nod), Danny Meyer tapped Abram Bissell to lead the kitchen at The Modern, a move that gave it a Michelin bump. The two-star venue offers a by-the-dish menu in its expansive bar room -- an economical place to sample Bissell's playful, ingredient-focused fare for less. Most items run less than $30 each, like the avocado with peekytoe crab, the green garlic gnocchi, and the spicy steak tartare.
Jungsik’s unadvertised à la carte menu is available first come, first served at the bar. Instead of paying $155 for the seasonal prix fixe, you can combine the branzino, octopus and sea urchin for $90. And, unlike at a table where every guest is required to partake of the tasting, you can even split the bill with a pal.
The $58 two-course power lunch at Michael White's pricey Midtown establishment is nearly half the cost of the most expensive dinner entree, a $102 whole branzino for two. The options are also quite extensive, with your choice of crudi or antipasti to start, followed by several pastas or proteins, like the strozzapreti with jumbo lump crab, the fusilli with octopus bone marrow, the seared sea scallops, and the pan-roasted dover sole.
No time (or cash) for the sit-down tasting at Daniel Boulud's double-starred flagship? Snag a seat in the bar and lounge room, where you can sample surprisingly generous dishes à la carte, some hovering around $50. It'll feel like a more leisurely affair here, but the staff doesn't skimp on hospitality -- you'll be getting the same winning service as prix fixe diners, plus an elegant, jazzy ambience.
Tucked away inside Grand Central Terminal, you'll find the new-Nordic restaurant from chefs Claus Meyer and Gunnar Gíslason showcasing locally farmed ingredients. A separate à la carte menu means you can feast on forono beets and Pennsylvanian lamb shank for $45 -- $100 less than the nightly tasting menu.
At $75, chef Patti Jackson's prix fixe menu is already one of the best deals in town, but further savings can be had by dining in Delaware and Hudson's Tavern extension right next door. Jackson also draws inspiration from the Mid-Atlantic region for the pub menu, turning out dishes like spaetzle and schnitzel to go with large-format beers from the region.
The strategy here is easy: you, the bar, an $18 tarte flambée, a $35 half-bottle of riesling, and a languid afternoon. With its cozy white leather banquettes and comprehensive menu -- including a long, award-winning wine list -- the lounge at Gabriel Kreuther is as fine as the dining room. Drop by the dessert annex for pastry chef Marc Aumont’s beautiful chocolate bonbons and petite desserts.
Don't be fooled by the fancy, white-tablecloth interior of the sprawling restaurant inside Chelsea's Maritime Hotel -- prices, while on the high side, aren't completely out of reach. Dine at the barroom Tapas Bar, where chef Anthony Sasso -- who garnered a Michelin sparkler at Casa Mono -- has put together a menu of creative Spanish-influenced small plates. A four-course menu featuring dishes like crispy fairy tale eggplant, garganelli with veal ragu, duck breast, and tiramisu runs $72 per person.
Not only is the afternoon a good time to eat on the cheap at this pristine fish den, it's also when you get the best deal overall -- and the proof is in the math. The nighttime sushi omakase costs $65 for 10 pieces; the lunch option is $35 for seven pieces, plus half a roll. Average that out and the nigiri rings up to $6.50 each at dinner, but only $5 each at lunch -- and that's not even counting the extra half-roll.
At $69, Carbone's veal Parm may be out of budget, but order smartly with a friend at Mario Carbone and Rich Torrisi's retro red sauce palace and you’ll get away with dining for less than $50 each. An appetizer (chopped salad, $21), pasta (spicy rigatoni vodka, $32), and meat (cherry pepper ribs, $38) comes out to $45.50 person -- plus, the portions are as extravagant as the prices, so you'll likely be walking out with leftovers.
Lunch is the best time to eat affordably at this New American mainstay helmed by Alfred Portale. Entrees max out at $28 for dishes that will actually fill you up: pan-roasted chicken, soft shell crabs, and the Gotham burger -- fries included. There's also Gotham's greenmarket lunch, a $38 three-course meal highlighting ingredients sourced from the nearby Union Square farmers market.
The plates at Alex Raij and Eder Montero's beloved Brooklyn tapas joint are meant to be shared, so pool your dinner budget with some friends and you can can cobble together an excellent Spanish spread -- ranging from $4 spiced chickpeas to $32 roasted suckling pig -- at a pretty reasonable rate."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/what-is-candy-corn-supposed-to-taste-like,Thrillist,"When it comes to Halloween candy, few sugary handouts are as polarizing as candy corn.
It's basically the Peeps of fall. Although you've eaten, spit it out, or flat-out refused to touch it countless times in your life, there's a good chance ""sugary"" or ""bad"" are the only words you can think of to describe its flavor. But it turns out the true flavor of candy corn is markedly more complex. Really.
If you think about it, the classic kernel-shaped candy doesn't taste like any one specific thing (and it certainly tastes nothing like corn, despite its name), which likely explains all the sugar-fueled speculation over the years. So, what the hell is candy corn actually supposed to taste like (other than cavities)? The ingredients list doesn't offer many clues. Most of the candy corn products we looked at are made mostly of sugar, corn syrup, artificial flavorings, various artificial colorings, and soy protein as well as carnauba wax, presumably for texture.
In 2016, we contacted what's perhaps one of the greatest authorities on the subject, The Jelly Belly Candy Company. You might associate Jelly Belly with jelly beans, but the sweets giant actually got its start making candy corn and other mellocreme/buttercream candies at the turn of the 20th Century as the Goelitz Confectionery Company. It's been making the tricolored sugar triangles ever since.
""Candy Corn was modeled after corn in shape, but not taste. The actual flavor of Jelly Belly’s (formerly known by the family name, Goelitz) Candy Corn is a wonderful blend of creamy fondant, rich marshmallow, and warm vanilla notes. When combined, these flavors create the distinct Candy Corn flavor. The texture is as important as the flavor. Our Candy Corn is creamy and smooth; never coarse. It should be like biting into butter.""
Wow. Consider our minds blown.
Candy corn is supposed to have marshmallow, vanilla, and buttery caramel-like flavor notes, which combine to form that super-sweet, unique, and often polarizing candy corn flavor. The reason why it's called candy corn is also incredibly simple: It's modeled after the shape of a corn kernel, according to the spokesperson. Really makes you want to eat some candy corn now, doesn't it? Okay, okay, maybe not."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/jane-hotel-closing-transforms-members-only-club,Thrillist,"It's the end of an era in the NYC nightclub scene. The Jane Hotel is officially closing its doors, or rather, it is only keeping them open for a select few.
After being sold to hotelier and owner of Monkey Bar and City Club Jeff Klein back in February, The Jane is now set to become a members-only hotspot under the new ownership. The venue will become one of Klein's San Vicente Bungalows club locations, which are membership-based clubs that originally opened in West Hollywood.
Before becoming official, the news had been rumored since the sale. In February, a public liquor license application reported that Klein was requesting the existing license for the Jane Hotel to be transferred to the Jane St. Social Club Inc., described as a ""members-only establishment to be located in the same building.""
The hotel was originally built for sailors in 1908, and later became a celebrity-favorite hotspot before giving way to NYC's party-oriented college students and young professionals. To this day, the hotel is still a go-to nightlife hotspot for many.
Luckily, New Yorkers have another 10 days to say their goodbyes. November 19 will be the last night when everybody will be able to dance under the iconic disco ball, and on the day after, the Jane Hotel will officially close and get ready for its next chapter.

https://www.eater.com/2015/12/21/10633750/mcdonalds-mac-and-cheese-test-cleveland,Eater,"It's being served at select locations in Cleveland.
McDonald's just can't help itself when it comes to launching new menu items: Select locations of the Golden Arches are now serving mac and cheese. The childhood favorite can currently be had as a Happy Meal entree or ordered a la carte for $1.75 at select locations in the Cleveland, Ohio area, reports Brand Eating.
Banish any thoughts of powdered cheese à la Kraft, however: According to a McDonald's employee reached via telephone, the product comes in frozen. Per promotional materials, the mac and cheese has 190 calories, about the same as a four-piece McNugget. But offering it as a Happy Meal entree means kids can feast on a meal of mac and cheese, fries, and soda, which sounds even more unhealthy than the usual burger or nuggets combo.
Cheese producers and dairy farmers are clearly loving McDonald's right now: Last month the chain introduced mozzarella sticks at select stores, and the deep-fried cheese bombs are slated to roll out nationwide in 2016. Ronald McDonald clearly has even more tricks up his sleeve for next year, too: The company just trademarked the phrase ""Signature Crafted,"" which is apparently the latest moniker for its line of fancied up burgers. Perhaps its energy would be better focused on all-day breakfast, a recent introduction that actually seems to be driving customers to stores.

And this ain’t nothing new… the city has now won the ‘Most Stressed City’ in the US accolade for three years running. Ouch.
As for Clevelanders thinking of darting off to the land of GMC and starting a new life in neighboring Detroit, well, they might want to revise their plans: Detroit’s the runner-up, slumped with the highest unemployment rate nationwide. Coming in at three is Gulfport in Mississippi, where the weather doesn’t exactly allow for easy resting; followed by Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Memphis inducing anxieties of all sorts.
By contrast, Fremont in California is the survey’s least stressful place to live. The city is known for being one of the most culturally and ethnically diverse cities in the Bay Area, as well as having beautiful parks, excellent schools and jobs aplenty (oh, and we hear that the sushi restaurants are darn good—no wonder their divorce rate is the lowest in the country).

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/john-oliver-pumpkin-spice-latte,Thrillist,"On his Peabody Award-winning show Last Week Tonight, John Oliver has tackled a laundry list of the most contentious issues the United States faces today, taking a stand on topics like net neutrality, student debt, and global warming. But whether from cowardice or ignorance, one subject had escaped his righteous, satiric ire.
On this week’s show, however, Oliver finally treated the profoundly absurd enthusiasm newscasters show when talking about the Pumpkin Spice Latte to the in-depth takedown it warranted. The crew at Last Week Tonight assembled a supercut of newscasters saying bizarre things about the arrival and departure of fall's official beverage. These clips of talking heads are interspersed with a voiceover worthy of a monster-truck rally. The whole segment is, in fact, objectively hilarious.
While the hugely popular latte's arrival has marked the coming of autumn like a pagan moon dance harvest ritual for 15 years, its success remains one of the 21st century's great mysteries, so if you're looking for answers, you won't find them here. It might be better to just watch the video above with a nice PSL (""P-S-L!!!!!!!!"") and drink up the absurdity of it all."
https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/celebrity-sighting-restaurants-nyc,Theinfatuation,"Let’s get one thing straight right off the bat: New York City is not Los Angeles. We don’t have as many restaurants that cater almost exclusively to people who have new relationships to debut, like Craig’s or Nobu Malibu (although we do have Carbone and Nobu Downtown). The culture is different here, and half of your celebrity encounters will inevitably occur at little neighborhood spots or the West Village post office on Hudson Street. But if you’re grabbing dinner with someone who reads too many blind items, here are some restaurants where you can increase your odds of spotting someone famous.
The Polo Bar is the closest you’ll get to a guaranteed celebrity sighting. It’s also one of the toughest reservations in NYC, and that somehow feels like an understatement. In order to get a table at Ralph Lauren’s subterranean, ultra-preppy Midtown restaurant, you have to call and speak to a reservationist who will inevitably tell you that there’s no availability. If you do manage to get a table, you’ll be able to eat some surprisingly solid American food in a country club-esque room filled with equestrian paintings and people you’ve seen giving press briefings and awards speeches.
Due in large part to its location, Le Rock is a reliable place to spot a celebrity having a leisurely tax-deductible meal with their agent. This restaurant, from the team behind Frenchette, is situated on the edge of Rockefeller Center, just a few steps from where Jimmy Fallon shoots a talk show watched exclusively by people in 24-hour laundromats. The pristine dining room has high ceilings and Art Deco accents, and the food is some of the best on this list. Eat some escargots and steak haché, and pay attention to whoever’s sitting in the corner.
Carbone had its moment, and that moment was around 2015. But you’ll still see celebrities here, and you’ll still have a very hard time getting a table. Due to the hype, you’ll hear people complain about the food as if hating this Greenwich Village restaurant is a badge of honor. But that take is neither original nor accurate. Carbone serves perfectly good red sauce Italian fare, and the complimentary antipasti is a nice touch. Come if you want to spend a ton of money and maybe see Justin Bieber. Or don’t. You’ll be fine either way.
Is Torrisi the new Carbone? Sort of. It’s from the same people, and it’s another trendy downtown spot with high production value. Torrisi's loft-like space in a historic Nolita building is bigger than Carbone's, however, so it’s slightly easier to get a table. This place is also relatively new, so you're more likely to see the most current crop of celebrities here. Inspired by Little Italy and NYC in general, the menu leans Italian with a bunch of other influences, and it’s pretty interesting. Try the chicken liver with Manischewitz jelly and the pastrami-spiced short rib (an homage to nearby Katz’s).
Famous people like eating at Via Carota. But not because it’s a party or scene. (Technically it’s the latter, but it definitely isn’t the former.) Via Carota is popular because it’s one of the best Italian restaurants in NYC, and the food is consistently excellent. This place is also in the West Village, which doesn’t hurt (see below). Nowadays, this dark, casual, farmhouse-like spot takes some reservations, but it’s still pretty much walk-in-only. You’re going to have to wait several hours for your table, but once you get seated, you might see Adam Driver eating tonarelli.
For most, L’Artusi is a special occasion spot. But if you have several Golden Globe nominations and/or a $10 million dollar townhouse (as many West Village residents do), it’s just a nice place for a casual weeknight meal. You might stop by for an anniversary dinner only to notice a few Apatows eating bucatini right behind you. This sort of thing is not uncommon. If you can’t snag a reservation, put your name in for a few seats at the bar. The pasta here remains perfect, and the setting is generically romantic.
The team behind Holiday Bar also runs American Bar and Saint Theo’s, two West Village restaurants that seem like they were designed to attract celebrities and influencers who thrive in photogenic situations. Holiday Bar is the newest of the bunch, and, in an ecosystem that runs on hype, that makes it the most relevant. This ‘80s-themed spot (also in the West Village) has off-white banquettes, art by Alex Katz, and a menu with everything from spring rolls and lamb meatballs to sushi and jerk chicken. Reservations aren’t impossible, so try this place for a last-minute meal with someone who requires a scene.
Like Holiday Bar, Casino appears to have some kind of 1980s thing going on, but it’s more of a low-key, artsy ‘80s thing. The space has bright red floors and funky light fixtures, and the food is mostly decadent Southern European stuff. Stop by and enjoy a cosmo and a whole roasted turbot while you look around the candlelit dining room and try to guess what everyone does for a living. This restaurant is in Dimes Square, so you never really know who you're going to see. You might spot a cast member of Euphoria, or you might just wind up talking to some people who've never paid their own rent.
Why do so many celebrities go to Laser Wolf? There are a few reasons. The chef is pretty famous, the food is top-notch, and, most importantly, the view is worth at least several million dollars. Located on the roof of the Hoxton Hotel in Williamsburg, this place serves grilled Israeli meats and vegetables with unlimited mezze and impressive views of the Manhattan skyline. It’s worth checking out, even if you aren’t just here to see a random senator or someone you recognize from Netflix. Come when the weather is warm for the best results.
We checked out these new restaurants—and loved them.
If you're looking for a place to wear that sample sale piece sitting in the back of your closet, try one of these restaurants.
When you want dinner to feel less like the pre-party and more like the party itself, check out one of these 11 spots."
https://www.timeout.com/news/revealed-the-airlines-that-had-the-fewest-delays-in-2022-010423,Timeout,"Let’s not beat around the bush: last year the aviation industry was, for the most part, a mess. Unable to cope with huge demand for air travel following the lowering of travel restrictions, airports around the world saw endless queues, huge piles of lost bags and screen after screen of cancelled flights. Not to mention all the strikes that hit airlines and airports.
Amidst all the chaos, however, some airlines proved much more reliable than others. Aviation data company Cirium looked at flights throughout 2022 to to find out which airlines were, statistically speaking, the safest bets. Its study ranked airlines based on their how on-time they were – defined as arriving within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival time.
Top of Cirium’s study was Azul Brazilian Airlines, which arrived on time a whopping 88.93 percent of the time. Azul ran nearly 280,000 flights last year, so to have only 11 percent of those delayed is pretty impressive.
The next two least-delayed airlines in the list were All Nippon Airlines (88.61 percent on-time) and Japan Airlines (88 percent), both of which are Japanese airlines that flew about 160,000 flights in 2022.
Here are the top ten airlines in the world with the fewest delays in 2022 according to Cirium, along with the percentage of flights that arrived on-time.
If you’d like to find out more, you can read Cirium’s full study for yourself here. In any case, it’s good to know which airlines are your best bet to arrive on time – even amid times of chaos.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/nightclub-musica-opens-in-nyc-hells-kitchen,Thrillist,"NYC's newest nightclub is bringing a little slice of Italy to the West Side of Manhattan. Musica, a new entertainment venue opening in Hell's Kitchen, comes to NYC straight from Italy's nightlife capital Riccione.
The club consists of three parts. The Whisper Room is an opulent ground-floor lounge with private booths, a stage, and a bar. The main floor features two bars, three areas, a VIP lounge, and more. And there's also an open-air rooftop with views of the Hudson River.
The 25,000-square-foot venue is a collaboration between Giuseppe Cipriani and Italian entrepreneur Tito Pinton. It occupies the space of the former Prince Club.
""Musica began as an ambitious project between Giuseppe Cipriani and I at the beginning of 2020. After a successful debut in our original location in Riccione, which is widely known as the nightlife capital of Italy, we knew it was time to bring the concept to New York City,"" said Tito Pinton in a press statement. ""With the support and partnership of nightlife powerhouses like Susanne Bartsch, Lady Fag, Rocco Ancarola, and Francesco Belcaro, Musica provides New Yorkers with a nightlife experience like never before, including premium hospitality and service, unique immersive experiences, and top-tier entertainment.""
Musica is open Thursday to Sunday from 11 pm to 4 am at 637 West 50th Street in Manhattan."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/nyc-replaces-metrocard-machines-end-of-2023,Thrillist,"The Big Apple is soon going to lose one of its giants—or rather, many of them. By the end of 2023, the city's iconic metal MetroCard machines will be phased out completely.
The MTA recently announced the news via Twitter, telling New Yorkers that OMNY vending machines will replace the old ones. With the OMNY technology, citizens and tourists alike can pay at the turnstile with a simple tap of their contactless device or card rather than swiping in with the current MetroCard system.
While the new method is surely more efficient, the news were met with bittersweet nostalgia by city residents. ""NOOOO WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?!?!,"" reads one of the tweets in response to the MTA's. ""what is WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE,"" complains another one. Some users have more practical questions about the MTA's choice, saying the replacement of the old machines with OMNY ones will create problems for those who don't own smartphones or devices equipped with contactless technology, including some elderly residents or people experiencing homelessness.
Luckily, though, the tap-in option is only an additional service provided by OMNY machines. Those wishing to use a physical card can do so by purchasing an OMNY card at many stores across the city, including Walgreens, CVS, and 7-Eleven. OMNY cards are reloadable with cash or credit cards at vendors that sell them, and they are equipped with the same contactless technology.
The old MetroCard machines will begin to be switched out starting early next year, and the process should be completed by the end of 2023, Curbed reports. The machines first started serving NYC's subway stations in 1999 after the system phased out tokens. They'll be retiring after 24 years of service."
https://www.thrillist.com/eat/new-york/wan-wan-thai-restaurant-nolita-first-look,Thrillist,"Translating into “throwback,” Wan Wan is from the team behind popular spots Wayla and Kimika.
When Rivers and Hills Hospitality Group—the team behind the Thai spot, Wayla, in the Lower East Side and the Japanese-Italian mashup, Kimika (also one of NYC’s best restaurants) in Nolita—set their sights on opening their latest concept, the vision was clear. Wan Wan, which translates to “throwback” in Thai, would serve as a celebration and homage to the timeless fare of Phuket.
In Phuket, a lush province in the southern region of Thailand, cuisine inspiration is drawn from a variety of cultural influences including China, Malaysia, and, of course, other various regions of Thailand, and highlights cooking with seafood, vegetables, and tropical fruit.
Channeling that knowledge, partners chef Tom Naumsuwan (Wayla) and Erika Chou of River and Hills dedicated the menu to spotlighting lesser-known delicacies and dishes from the region.
The food program, which is led by Bangkok native chef Nausuwan, is split into savory shared plates and hearty noodle specialites. Among the standout offerings on the opening menu, there’s Yum Hoi (scallops, frisée, sea beans, chili); Guay Tiew Nua (beef broth, thinly shaved Wagyu, broccolini, rice noodles); and Sen Pla (fish noodles, veggie broth, seared branzino).
With the liquor license still pending, spirit-free cocktails reign supreme on the beverage menu like the La Vie En Thai (hibiscus, citrus foam, yuzu) and Wan Wankazi (lime cordial, orange juice, lime). Stay tuned as decadent, coastal-inspired drinks using gin and vodka are slated to join the list soon.
Staying true to its namesake, the 48-seat interior of Wan Wan delves into nostalgia. The eclectic retro decor, including rose- and white-checkered floors, an antique Art Deco chandelier from the 1930s, and a smattering of country-style hutches, “feels akin to dropping by your aunt or uncle’s place for a bite to eat,” according to Chou.
Wan Wan is now open Monday–Sunday from 5 pm–10 pm at 209 Mulberry Street in Nolita. Reservations can be made via Resy.

https://www.thrillist.com/travel/new-orleans/where-to-stay-in-new-orleans,Thrillist,"New Orleans might not be the biggest city around, but it punches well above its weight when it comes to visitor-friendly wonders. There’s a surplus of cool things to do, including world-class restaurants and bars, plus killer live music every night of the year. So when it comes to planning a visit, the toughest part is often determining where to stay.
Make the most of your time in the Crescent City and seek out the neighborhood that’s the best fit for you. While no trip is complete without some time spent in the French Quarter, the city’s most famous neighborhood isn’t for everyone. Fortunately, there are lots of other worthy neighborhoods—each with its own distinct vibe—so here’s a guide to make choosing a home base for a memorable stay in New Orleans easy.
If you want to discover why NOLA has attracted creatives and cool kids from coast to coast, take a short stroll from the French Quarter across Esplanade Avenue to reach the Marigny, which flows right into the Bywater. While some visitors never make it past Frenchmen Street—one of the city’s premier party strips, packed with beloved local haunts and music venues—those who venture beyond are rewarded with an endless supply of historic buildings and colorful Creole cottages, many of which house charmingly intimate cafes and eclectic shops.
Where to stay: With its thoughtful design and striking environs, Hotel Peter & Paul—formerly a Catholic church and school—has become a popular option for hip out-of-towners looking for a home base in the Marigny. Those eager to stay in the middle of nightlife madness are wise to consider The Frenchmen, Royal Street Inn, or Royal Frenchmen, all of which are a short stumble from dozens of popular venues. For a quieter experience, seek out one of the area’s many B&Bs; top picks include Auld Sweet Olive Bed & Breakfast and R&B Bed and Breakfast.
Things to do: It’s easy, and recommended, to get lost while strolling through some of the city’s most scenic streets. Go crate digging at Euclid Records or Louisiana Music Factory, then enjoy a leisurely stroll along the river at breezy Crescent Park. If it’s a hot one, escape the sun while exploring Studio BE—the huge warehouse space that showcases the work of local artist Brandon “Bmike” Odums—or JAMNOLA, an immersive, New Orleans-themed “cultural funhouse” that was designed to boost your Insta grid.
Best restaurants:Bacchanal provides an outdoor dinner party setting where strangers make new friends while enjoying curated wine and cheese, thoughtful small plates, and free live music in the famously photogenic, Mediterranean-style courtyard. Award-winning barbecue is the name of the game at The Joint, and Chef Nina Compton lures Top Chef fans to her Bywater American Bistro. Don’t leave without trying the famous praline bacon at Elizabeth’s, or sweet treats from Taylor Swift’s preferred local cake spot at Bywater Bakery. For weekend thrills, the city’s liveliest drag brunch can be found at The Country Club.
Best bars and nightlife: A welcome alternative to the tourist-packed Quarter, various beloved drinking dens double as meeting points for local social groups, service industry workers, and out-of-town scenesters looking to tap into the only-in-NOLA vibes. Come nighttime, follow the cool kids to St. Claude Avenue, home to indie stalwarts like Siberia and Hi-Ho Lounge. The largest and most boisterous crowds can be found on Frenchmen Street, which is home to higher-priced clubs featuring national acts (Blue Nile, Snug Harbor), as well as low-key dives (Apple Barrel, Cafe Negril) that rarely charge a cover. For a hidden rendezvous over a well-made cocktail, head to Hotel Peter and Paul’s The Elysian Bar.
A magnet for first-time visitors, the French Quarter is one of the world’s most visually striking neighborhoods, overflowing with captivating history, iconic architecture, legendary restaurants and music venues, and so much more. Running through it all like a booze-filled vein is Bourbon Street, which can’t be avoided if you want to check out some of the city’s most enduring, and notorious, haunts. No visit to NOLA is complete without time spent soaking up the Quarter in all of its glory.
Where to stay: The compact, easily walkable Quarter contains a diverse array of lodging choices that put visitors right in the middle of the action. Hotel Monteleone, family-owned and -operated since 1886, is home to the Carousel Bar, which features a slowly revolving bar, classic cocktails, and live music. The Ritz-Carlton, New Orleans provides a classy oasis along sometimes-chaotic Canal Street, and the Royal Sonesta New Orleans offers balcony rooms right on Bourbon Street, ideal for those wanting an up-close view of 24/7 debauchery.
Things to do: For a classic French Quarter experience, follow in the footsteps of countless visitors and start your day with some piping hot beignets and a cafe au lait at the original Cafe Du Monde, then cross the street to gawk at idyllic Jackson Square, home to postcard-perfect St. Louis Cathedral. Running parallel to down-and-dirty Bourbon Street is one of the city’s most enchanting paths—lined with world-class art galleries and antique shops, Royal Street is often patrolled by a coterie of lively street performers. A good place to start is M.S. Rau, a 36,500-square-foot gallery that has been lauded as one of the best antique showrooms in the world.
Best restaurants: Befitting the city’s oldest neighborhood, the “Vieux Carre” is home to some of the oldest continually-operating restaurants in the country. Galatoire’s, Arnaud’s, Antoine’s, and Tujague’s all serve as living culinary museums; each overflows with historical touches, perfect for anyone eager to explore the traditional Creole dishes and cordial service of a bygone era.New-school options include tropical bites at Palm & Pine, modernized Creole at Saint John, and Southern fare at swoon-worthy Sylvain. For a quick bite in between (or after) drinks, head to Verti Marte, a 24/7 grocery that was Anthony Bourdain’s preferred spot for po’boys and other late-night noshes.
Best bars and nightlife: Take advantage of NOLA’s uniquely lax alcohol regulations, grab your favorite tipple from the nearest bar, and enjoy a stroll along Bourbon Street, where you can peek inside to check the scene at notorious party spots like Pat O’ Brien’s or Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop. Order their iconic drinks—bright red hurricanes at the former, Voodoo daiquiris colloquially known as “purple drank” at the latter—at your own peril. Music fans can seek out jazzy thrills at ever-popular venues such as Preservation Hall and the Davenport Lounge. For first-rate cocktails, seek out nationally lauded stalwarts like Jewel of the South, Cane & Table, and the French 75 Bar.
The Central Business District (CBD), which lies just across Canal Street from the French Quarter, extends into the Warehouse District and its notable cultural institutions. Popular with business travelers and conventioneers, the once low-key area has perked up in recent years thanks to its growing ranks of hip hotels, trendy restaurants, and popular concert halls.
Where to stay: The area provides a centrally located base from which to explore the city, with quieter environs than what you’d find a few blocks away in the Quarter. Full of large chain properties and the expansive Harrah’s Casino, the CBD impresses with high-end hotels like The Windsor Court, The Roosevelt, and Four Seasons Hotel New Orleans. Sister properties Maison de la Luz and the Ace Hotel cater to cool crowds and visiting creatives. The colorful new Virgin Hotel is ideal for celebratory groups looking to enjoy rooftop pool vibes.
Things to do: One can easily spend a day touring one of the city’s most visited attractions, the National WWII Museum, but be sure to pencil in some time for other activities. The Ogden Museum of Southern Art is full of stunning regional works. Lined with modern art galleries, Julia Street is best enjoyed during one of the many open gallery nights held throughout the year. South Louisiana’s two largest event venues—the Caesars Superdome (home to the NFL’s Saints) and Smoothie King Center (home to the NBA’s Pelicans)—are separated by Champions Square; all three attract the biggest touring names in music, and serve as the backdrop for annual events like Essence Festival. The gloriously restored Orpheum, Civic, and Joy theaters all host big acts as well.
Best restaurants: Several of NOLA’s brightest culinary beacons are represented here, especially Donald Link, whose Herbsaint, Pêche Seafood Grill, Chemin à la Mer, Gianna, and Cochon all vie for attention. The flagship Emeril’s continues to delight groups of visitors, and Alon Shaya’s Miss River is ideal for celebratory crowds. For cheap eats, join the line at Beyonce’s favorite local eatery, Mother’s, or grab some best-in-class boudin and a meaty sandwich to go at Cochon Butcher.
Best bars and nightlife: For an education in local cocktail history, buzz through the Sazerac House—admission is free, and there are samples!—then stroll on over to The Roosevelt’s timeless Sazerac Bar to enjoy a properly made version of the namesake cocktail. Bar Marilou’s bordello-like space is one of the city’s sexiest drinking dens, and cocktails with a view can be found next door at Alto, the rooftop pool bar atop the Ace. Sports fans can keep an eye on all the games and check out cool local memorabilia at Manning’s, while Ernst Cafe and Lucy’s Retired Surfers Bar cater to those looking for dirt-cheap drinks and good times.
Nestled between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, Mid-City provides a welcome break from the Quarter. The two neighborhoods are linked by the Lafitte Greenway, a 2.6-mile paved trail, as well as the Canal Street streetcar. Famous for its cemeteries, Mid-City comes alive every spring in the run-up to the Jazz and Heritage Festival; during those two weekends in late April and early May, the streets overflow with JazzFest revelers and the sounds of porch concerts. A range of beloved, lived-in hangouts ensure you’ll have plenty of opportunities to interact with the locals, anytime of year.
Where to stay: Befitting its true neighborhood feel, Mid-City is light on lodging options, which proves especially challenging for the thousands of out-of-towners searching for a place to stay during JazzFest. There are no large hotels, only small inns and B&Bs like Ashton’s B&B, Inn at the Old Jail, Canal Street Inn, and the 1896 O’ Malley House. For an affordable option that’s low on frills but heavy on indie vibes, check out The Drifter.
Things to do: To get a sense of Mid-City’s diverse population and community pride, take a walk or bike ride through the colorful houses of the Bayou St. John area, and be sure to check out the historic landmarks along Bayou Road. Take a break from all the food and drink by enjoying a stroll around beloved City Park, home to the New Orleans Museum of Art and its stunning (and free-to-visit) Besthoff Sculpture Garden. To understand the distinctive way locals honor the dead, join a walking tour of the above-ground Masonic and St. Patrick’s cemeteries.
Best restaurants:Parkway Bakery & Tavern might just be the city’s definitive place to try a po’boy, and while there you can check some other only-in-NOLA items like jambalaya and alligator sausage off your culinary bucket list. Other can’t-miss options with lots of local flavor include Toups’ Meatery and Liuzza’s By The Track, while Bevi Seafood Co. is an ideal spot for trying boiled crawfish when they’re in season. Take a step back in time and reward yourself with a stop at old-time Angelo Brocato’s, where the sweet treats have been a local tradition since 1905.
Best bars and nightlife: Mid-City’s nocturnal gems come in a variety of forms. Rock’n’Bowl is a local institution famous for its unique combination of slick bowling lanes and top-notch live music. Bayou Wine Garden and Wrong Iron are a pair of indoor-outdoor, all-purpose hangouts where after-work crowds rub shoulders (and cross leashes) with local residents. Catch a big soccer game at the city’s preeminent soccer bar, Finn McCool’s, and you’ll likely make new friends by halftime.
Uptown contains several smaller, heavily residential neighborhoods such as the Garden District, Irish Channel, Black Pearl, Riverside, and Carrollton. Here you’ll find the scenic St. Charles Avenue streetcar (a steal at $1.25 per ride), opulent historic mansions, the Tulane and Loyola campuses, and the genteel Audubon Park and Zoo. During Carnival season, the trees are covered in beads and house parties spill out into the street, but anytime’s a good time to explore its family-run cafes, po’boy shops, and sno-ball stands.
Where to stay:The Chloe and Hotel Saint Vincent, two of the most notable hotels to open in recent years, feature unique design touches and trendy F&B outlets in chic environs. Visitors looking to be in the middle of the action are wise to stay on St. Charles Avenue; popular choices include The Columns and Hotel Indigo Garden District.
Things to do: Uptown’s primary commercial streets—Magazine, Freret, Oak, and Maple—are filled with a dizzying array of independent shops and eateries. Take a break from all the great window shopping by taking a guided walking tour of jaw-dropping Garden District mansions, or reconnect with nature by spending some time at Audubon Park and Zoo.
Best restaurants: Uptown specializes in beloved fine dining haunts with welcoming environments. Prime examples include Commander’s Palace, Brigtsen's, and La Petite Grocery. A number of notable new-school options can be found along Magazine Street: high-end Indian fare with a local accent at Saffron, Alon Shaya’s vivid Middle Eastern dishes at Saba, and mouth-watering takes on Creole classics at Gris-Gris. Or veer just off of Magazine to try Turkey and the Wolf’s personality-packed sandwiches.
Best bars and nightlife: Colorful neighborhood dives like Parasol’s, Tracey’s, and Ms. Mae’s all live up to their legendary reputations, as does one of the city’s most lauded cocktail dens, Cure. NOLA Brewing and Urban South offer expansive playgrounds for beer-fueled fun, and live music fans are well-served at Tipitina’s and Le Bon Temps Roule."

Greenpoint's Burnt Books is one such place. Located inside a classic New York bodega called Green Discount Corp., this vintage bookstore can only be found if you've heard about it before. It opened on July 23, and the owner, Jason Mojica, told Eater that he decided to partner with the bodega's owner to set up his store. Mojica is also the owner of nearby comic book store Hey Kids Comics!, and decided to open a store within a store to save up on rent.
Burnt Books' Instagram profile is filled with cool titles. Coffee table books like The Wise Garden Encyclopedia as well as old nonfiction like The True Story of Bonnie & Clyde fill its shelves, and both avid and casual readers can find something to pique their interest.
According to the Instagram caption of one of the store's posts, Burnt Books is ""open nearly always."" What that means is that Burnt Books might be welcoming customers when other shops are usually closed for the day. ""[The hours] are far from that of a traditional bookstore,"" Mojica told Thrillist. ""My other shop, for example, is only open five days a week, seven hours a day,"" he added, referring to Hey Kids Comics! Burnt Books is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 am–9 pm, and on Saturday and Sunday from 9 am–9 pm.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/nightclub-daphne-opens-nyc-chinatown,Thrillist,"It's time to put on your dancing shoes: a new nightclub just landed on the New York City scene.
Daphne—located on the underground floor of hotel 50 Bowery in the heart of Chinatown—is the latest concept by the Gerber Group, the organization behind staple NYC nightlife spots like Mr. Purple in the Lower East Side and The Crown, 50 Bowery's rooftop bar.
With the pandemic making business complicated for established venues, restaurants, and bars over the past two years, openings have been scarce.
""We are excited to help bring NYC nightlife back,"" said Owen Gerber, son of Gerber Group CEO Scott Gerber and partner in this project, in an official statement. ""We wanted to recreate the disco, vintage-feel that my father experienced in his 20s, for my generation.""
A quick first look around will give guests the impression of being inside a flower shop. The sprawling, 2,500-square-foot venue is decorated with a grand silk flower installation by Floratorium, the boutique flower studio behind the famous installations at The Beekman hotel and high-end restaurants like Marea. Dazzling disco balls and high-energy music will entertain guests, while the club's bar will quench their thirst with an extensive cocktail menu. It spans from classics—like Espresso Martinis, Casamigos Margaritas, and the GG Manhattan—to craft cocktails like Light My Fire, featuring Casamigos Blanco tequila, honey ginger, fresh lime, and flamed rosemary.
For larger groups or fancy celebrations, 20 V.I.P. tables are also available for reservations. And for anyone who wants to grab a bite before ending the night, there's always the option of a late-night double-patty smash burger and fries.
Daphne will be open from 10 pm to 4 am every Friday and Saturday. To book a table, visit their website or email info@daphnenyc.com."

It's not every day that a new nightclub opens in New York City, especially one that harks back to an old sort of New York—when nightclubs were the city's premiere destinations for some after-hours fun. Which is why Daphne, a new subterranean spot under Hotel 50 Bowery in Chinatown, is so special.
Hospitality company Gerber Group opened Daphne earlier this month as a complement to the hotel's rooftop bar, The Crown, and New Yorkers have been flocking to it ever since.
Upon entering the massive 2,500-square-foot space, patrons are pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful silk pink flower installation by art studio Floratorium. Dazzling disco balls also permeate the premises, calling back to a time when the dance club you frequented was just as important as where your apartment was located.
""There haven't been many new club openings in New York City in the past two years,"" said Owen Gerber, part owner of Daphne, in an official statement about the news. ""We wanted to recreate the disco, vintage feel that my father [Gerber Group CEO Scott Gerber] experienced in his 20s, for my generation.""
In addition to clubs' signature bottle service, the bartenders at Daphne can serve some remarkable cocktails that range from the classic to modern interpretations of the form. For every dirty martini, old fashioned and margarita there is an Aphrodite (Malfy gin, fortified wine, pomegranate and fresh lemon), Lite My Fire (Patron silver tequila, ginger liqueur, fresh lime and flamed rosemary) and Cider Car (Hennessy, apple cider and apricot liqueur), among other options.
The only other major club that has opened in New York since the pandemic changed the way we interact with each other is Nebula, a massive, multi-level, 11,000-square-foot nightclub that opened back in November of 2021 smack-dab in the middle of Times Square.
Following what felt like a collective preference for cocktail bars over dance clubs for the past few years, could we perhaps be living through the beginning of a new discoteque-heavy trend?"

However, you may not remember that the whole reason Starling is interacting with Lecter is to track down Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb (played masterfully by Ted Levine) and hopefully rescue his latest victim, young Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith) before she herself harms his white, poodle-like puppy named Precious.
And now you can stay there, by renting it on Airbnb. The owner, Christopher, explains in the listing how you can recreate scenes and take selfies throughout the house. Start with the classic pose of Gumb peering out of the front door, then step inside the foyer where he lures Agent Starling into the house. Incidentally, the curio where Gumb searches for business cards is still there! Plus there are fictional newspaper cuttings detailing Gumb's gruesome activities and all sorts of other related movie memorabilia.
Moreover, an interactive set in the basement has been faithfully recreated, complete with a vintage singer sewing machine, the American flag, full length mirror, mannequins dressed in vintage 80’s outfits, a kimono, fully functional disco ball, and motion activated speakers playing Goodbye Horses as you enter the basement. The haunting song, by artist Q Lazzarus, is now infamous with the Buffalo Bill dance scene.
The character of Jame Gumb was loosely based on serial killer Gary Heidnik, who was every bit as twisted as the infamous movie character he inspired. He used his victims as sex slaves, forced them to torture each other, and even ground one of their bodies up and forced the other women to eat her flesh.
The house offers an impressive list of features for any visitors, including complimentary gifts like ;the best selling Buffalo Bill's House body lotion, four bedrooms with the capability to sleep up to eight, a full kitchen with every appliance imaginable and a 50in flatscreen Samsung TV.
Because much of the movie was filmed nearby and in the surrounding area, every Halloween fans flock to southwestern Pennsylvania where, at the Soldiers & Sailor's Memorial Hall, a Silence of the Lambs-themed event is held. The large freestanding cage where they attempt to contain Dr. Lecter in the movie was replicated and erected in the cavernous hall — which was also the location of his bloody escape scene."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/taco-bell-naked-egg-taco-fried-egg-shell,Thrillist,"When Taco Bell first teased a bizarre breakfast taco with a shell made entirely out of a fried egg back in April, the clock started ticking down to the day when the chain would unleash the insane stunt food nationwide. Whether you’re ready for it or not, that day — may it be remembered accordingly — is almost here.
Taco Bell announced on Tuesday that the aptly named Naked Egg Taco will officially debut at its restaurants across the country on Thursday, August 31. In case it hasn’t hit you yet, the taco is basically inside-out: It’s made by stuffing crispy potatoes, bacon or sausage, and cheese into a folded fried egg shell. In other words, T-Bell is applying the same madness it used to create the Naked Chicken Chalupa’s fried chicken shell to simultaneously  innovate and bastardize the most important meal of the day.
T-Bell said it’s celebrating the big launch with with brunch-like “Bell & Breakfast” events across the country, where you’ll have the chance to taste the Naked Egg Taco before it arrives in stores. The first event will take place on August 17 in New York, followed by Laguna Beach, California on August 25, Austin on August 26, and Chicago on August 27. Reservations for the events are now available on OpenTable, with additional availability coming in the lead up to August 31, according to a press release.
If you prefer to have a more modest breakfast taco and potentially egg-free fingers, Taco Bell said it will also serve a “dressed” version of the Naked Egg Taco in a Gordita Flatbread. If anything, that’s probably your best bet if you want to douse the thing with the chain’s recently released Breakfast Salsa, or if you want to retain an ounce or two of dignity while eating breakfast."

New York Public Library's Grand Central branch, located at 135 East 46th Street, is officially closing on December 1, and all of its books and programs will be moved to nearby libraries.
The decision comes to no surprise. Since the beginning, the branch was a temporary solution while the new Donnell Library Center (53rd Street Library) was under construction, Gothamist reports. The Grand Central location was supposed to close in 2015 , but the lease was renewed because ongoing renovations were taking place inside the Grand Central branch itself and, additionally, the Donnell Library Center wasn't completed yet.
Now, both projects are completed, and NYPL's President Tony Marx said that NYPL can't afford to maintain the Grand Central space.
""The library has limited resources to serve this diverse city, and needs to be strategic and equitable about how it maintains its system and footprint,"" Marx said in an official statement. ""It is a challenge that requires tough decisions and this is one of them.""
Luckily, the closing of the branch won't lead to any layoffs. Many employees that were working at the Grand Central branch were already transferred to other locations earlier this year.

Now, to celebrate the new season of Stranger Things on Netflix in a few weeks, Burger King plans to start serving what's perhaps its most insignificant change to the Whopper ever. The chain is literally just flipping the whole thing upside down. Get it?
On June 21, select Burger King locations in a limited number of cities across the country will start serving what's dubbed the Upside Down Whopper, the company announced Thursday. The ""new"" sandwich is exactly the same as a normal Whopper, but inverted -- no colorful buns or over-the-top Stranger Things-themed ingredients. Instead, it features a flame-grilled beef patty topped (or should we say bottomed?) with tomatoes, white onions, lettuce, pickles, and mayo on a sesame seed bun. The only other difference you'll notice is special, limited-edition Stranger Things packaging.
Burger King said the Upside Down Whopper will be available at only 11 restaurants spread across major cities -- Miami, Houston, Boston, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Dallas, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York -- while supplies last, according to a press release. These locations will also offer Stranger Things t-shirts, crowns, ketchup packets, and pins. Of course, you can always just buy a regular Whopper and flip it upside down yourself if you can't make it to one of the few locations serving the official version.
Better yet, the chain's also offering a Stranger Things-inspired delivery deal via DoorDash. From now through June 20, you can order a ""Hopper Meal,"" a combo that includes a Whopper, small drink, and small fries for $5. If you use the code ""STRANGER"" on orders of $10 or more, they'll cover the delivery fee and give you access to special Stranger Things season 3 content. You can get the same deal from June 21 through July 7 with the code ""HOPPER."" You won't be getting the Upside Down Whopper, but again, you can just take the regular Whopper and eat it upside down if you feel so inclined.
The new season of Stranger Things hits Netflix on July 4. In the meantime, prepare yourself for all of the other show-themed products and marketing gimmicks."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/overture-jets-supersonic-flights-nyc-london,Thrillist,"Rather than a full night's sleep, flying from NYC to London could soon take the time of a restful nap.
The aviation company Boom Supersonic has recently developed a new super-fast jet model, dubbed Overture, which would be able to fly passengers across the ocean in about 3.5 hours, The Guardian reports. Normally, it takes a regular passenger jet about 7 hours to fly from NYC to London and vice versa.
The new jets aren't the first supersonic planes to hit the market. The Concorde, which was flown by both Air France and British Airways, flew the skies for 27 years before retiring in 2003. Its reputation was marred by a tragic and deadly July 2000 crash in Paris.
Overture jets won't be as fast as the Concorde, although they will fly at a speed of up to 1,304 miles per hour. According to The Guardian, airlines are already lining up to purchase them. American Airlines reportedly committed to buying up to 20 Overture jets, while United Airlines purchased 15 of them last year. Virgin Atlantic went shopping for them before anyone else, reportedly agreeing to purchase a few of them back in 2016.
A ticket aboard the new jets will be a pricey one. With a limited number of seats (65 to 88), passengers will only be able to purchase business class rates at first. They will have to wait to board the aircraft, though, as the first super-fast planes are expected to start welcoming guests in 2029.

Dishes at The Resy Drive-Thru New York event include Bonnie’s Yao Yu (a squid dish), Shuka’s falafel sandwich, Dhamaka’s dilliwala butter chicken with jeera pulao, and Crown Shy’s satsuma, vanilla and meringue ice cream sandwich. The pop-up restaurants will be arranged in a labyrinth along the Brooklyn waterfront at Skyline Drive-In in Greenpoint on Friday, September 16 and Saturday, September. 17.
As if riding in a golf cart and admiring the skyline while snacking weren’t enough, you can also expect entertainment, a trip to a classic New York bodega, a stop at a subway station, and a block party with a DJ.
The event was born out of the pandemic in Miami and Los Angeles as a way to enjoy restaurants more safely while venues were closed or operating in limited capacity. It was an instant hit, so naturally event organizers wanted to bring it to New York City.
Tickets go on sale for $110/person at Resy.com/DriveThru and in the Resy app at 10am on Wednesday, August 17. They are expected to be a hot commodity, as similar events in Miami and Los Angeles sold out in less than 15 minutes.
American Express is sponsoring the events, and that means American Express Gold Card members can buy tickets now if they link their cards to their Resy profile and purchase tickets with that card. Cardholders also get extra perks at the event, including pizza, bagels and drink tickets."

The announcement came via a simple sheet of paper posted on the door, with photos eventually making their way onto Reddit. According to the note, the store is looking for ""another location that will allow us to optimize the potential of our one and only license to sell wine in the state of New York."" Trader Joe's website confirms that the wine shop is now officially closed.
The wine shop served customers for over 15 years, and customers were particularly fond of its good bottles for lower-than-average prices. A regular shopper even told Patch that they travel all the way from the Upper West Side to shop Trader Joe's wine selection, but now they'll have to look elsewhere.
According to the announcement, the store's employees will have the opportunity to discuss transfer to another Trader Joe's in NYC, and they will be paid for their scheduled shifts through August 28."

A major Manhattan landmark has closed up shop.
Trader Joe’s Wine Shop, located at 138 E 14th St. just below Union Square, permanently shut its doors on Thursday, August 11, marking the end of an era for budget booze shoppers. The next door Trader Joe’s grocery store is still very much open for business, with the typical store-long line of NYU students, summer interns and commuters grabbing dark chocolate peanut butter cups and bags of frozen cauliflower gnocchi while they multitask crossing off their shopping lists while inching closer to the very distant registers.
“We have been operating our small Wine Shop in the Union Square neighborhood for over 15 years, and we thank you for all the business and support throughout the years,” reads a printed sign in the window of the now-shuttered shop. Trader Joe’s website confirms that this location is indeed permanently closed leaving yet another vacant storefront in Manhattan.
Naturally, New Yorkers are devastated at the unpredictable loss—and right before the weekend!
“Falling to my knees at the now out of business 14th st trader joe’s wine store,” someone tweeted. Many more shared their heartbreak on social media, with a devastating memorial thread currently being updated on Reddit.
But not all is lost: the message also states that the shop is exploring new locations to “optimize the potential of our one and only license to sell wine in New York… We look forward to sharing our plans to offer an even better wine shop experience to our New York customers as soon as they are finalized.” All staff members who lost their positions at the wine shop are being paid for their scheduled shifts through August 28 and will be offered opportunities to transfer to other New York City Trader Joe’s locations.
No word on where the wine inventory will transfer, but likely not to your favorite neighborhood Trader Joe’s. New York State law only allows one wine license per entity, meaning that grocery chains can only sell wine in one of their physical locations. Trader Joe’s capitalized on this by not using coveted shelf real estate to sell Two Buck Chuck, but rather utilize their one and only license to dedicate an entire shop to wine. This rule applies to all chain stores in the city, which is why only the Whole Foods on the Upper West Side (808 Columbus Ave.) sells wine (beer and alcoholic beverages under 6% ABV are allowed at other stores, as long as it’s less than 25% of the inventory).
Shoppers had no advance notice of Trader Joe’s Wine Shop’s closure, and some are speculating that the lease was up. Rent increases are hitting hard, which is all the more reason many in the neighborhood may be craving some cheap wine. Luckily, the East Village is far from a booze desert, with shops like Convive, Wines on First, East Village Wine & Spirits, plus many more, offering affordable bottles just blocks from Union Square. Pour one out for Two Buck Chuck tonight (but like, not too much, inflation is real!)."

At its new sunny storefront, you can shop for houseplants and even get some advice from a plant doctor. Horti plans to host apothecary workshops, pop-ups and live performances at the space.
Large, rare species of plants soar over 9 feet tall inside the shop, including the billowy Philodendron Giganteum, a waxy Ficus Elastica Burgundy, a broad-leaved Bird of Paradise and a rugged Euphorbia Trigona cactus. In the center of the showroom, there’s an ornate black-framed Victorian glass greenhouse for intimate talks and immersive sound baths. A neon sign reading “get dirty” beckons visitors to a repotting station.
""We've designed Horti PLAY as a space where people can drop by for a moment of respite from their day-to-day life and enjoy being surrounded by the calming presence of plants,"" Bryana Sortino, Horti co-founder and COO, said in a press release. ""With community as our driving purpose, we're already looking toward additional ways to use the store, such as an artists' co-working space and curated houseplant library.""
Plus, you can sign up for nationwide houseplant delivery, including month-to-month, six-month and 12-month subscription options. You'll get to select pots you like, including classic terracotta or multicolor options, and you can filter for pet-friendly plants. There are even houseplant insurance plans for gardening novices.
""Forming relationships with houseplants is at the core of our business, and Horti PLAY has been designed to reject the throw-away culture of shopping and instead put connection with nature at the forefront,"" Puneet Sabharwal, Horti co-founder and CEO said in a statement. ""There isn’t a houseplant store like this anywhere in New York City, and we look forward to using the space as the conduit to many long-lasting houseplant relationships."""
https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/most-affordable-luxury-hotels-in-the-us,Thrillist,"It's common to feel like where you live isn't that exciting or that luxury is too far out of reach in your state. But here's the thing, every single state has some four- or five-star hotels, and thanks to CashNetUSA, we now have a map of the most affordable luxury hotels in all 50 states.
""We used Hotels.com to search for a one-night stay on the same date for each state at least 10 weeks in advance of the stay,"" the CashNetUSA study states. ""Using the filter feature, we isolated hotels with a five-star rating in each state. When no five-star hotels were found for a state, we searched for four-star hotels.""
Below is a map with the cheapest luxury hotels in each state. In states where there weren't five-star hotels, four-star hotels were used instead. The study found that a room at the five-star Aria Resort & Casino in Las Vegas is the least expensive, costing $179 per night.
CashNetUSA also used this data to map a road trip across the United States so that you could spend a night in every most affordable luxury hotel in each state. Before you pack your bags, just note that the hotels alone would cost $17,581. So you may want to budget accordingly or stick to a much shorter route."

https://www.eater.com/2012/11/7/6524685/heres-bourdain-and-riperts-good-evil-chocolate-bar,Eater,"Details are in on the Good & Evil chocolate bar, which will be released by Anthony Bourdain, Eric Ripert and chocolatier Christopher Curtin at this weekend's New York Chocolate Show. ""Inspired by the dynamic friendship of [the] renowned culinary figures,"" the Good & Evil bar will be 72% cacao and made from Pure Nacional cacao from Peru, which was thought to be extinct.
This November, Christopher Curtin, European-trained Master Chocolatier and owner of Eclat Chocolate, a Pennsylvania-based gourmet chocolate manufacturer known for its singular truffles and confections, will debut Good & Evil, a 72% cacao chocolate bar inspired by the dynamic friendship of renowned culinary figures Eric Ripert and Anthony Bourdain. The bar will be introduced at the 15th annual New York Chocolate Show following a journey that began in Eclat's West Chester chocolate shop and made its way through the tropical jungles of Northern Peru.  Good & Evil captures the essence of the two iconic chefs' personalities while telling the story of one of the rarest cacao trees on earth: a prized variety called Pure Nacional that was thought to be extinct for nearly a century before being rediscovered growing on small isolated farms within Peru, the only place in the world where it is found.  When Ripert, chef and owner of the Michelin-starred Le Bernardin, first met Curtin, he fell in love with the deep, bold flavors of the Master Chocolatier's creations, developed after years of working side by side with the world's top chocolate makers. The pair quickly became friends and, along with Bourdain, decided to collaborate on a chocolate bar that would showcase the powerful flavor and aroma of this particular bean.  In April 2012 Ripert and Curtin traveled to Marañón Canyon, a remote area surrounded by 6,000-foot canyon walls in the Peruvian Andes Mountains and home to Pure Nacional. Here Curtin hand-selected only the Premier Cru Superieur—superior first harvest of the year—that would lay the foundation for Good & Evil. The resulting bar marries the controlled purity and smoothness of the chocolate, developed from the centuries-old process of conching, or blending, with the raw appeal of deliciously bitter cocoa nibs taken from the original beans.  This duality mirrors the connection between Ripert, who only sees the ""good"" in food, and Bourdain, who embraces the ""evil"" of the dark cocoa nibs. Together with Curtin, they hope Good & Evil will give everyone who tries it a sublime taste experience of the world's rarest cacao beans. The 2.6 oz. Good & Evil bar is $18 and available online at eclatchocolate.com and other select retail outlets."
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/24-hour-restaurants-in-nyc,Timeout,"New York is the city that never sleeps, it's no surprise that the same goes for its food-and-drink scene. But we’re not talking about greasy, nasty, only-when-you're-drunk eats but sit-down spots offering comfort-food dishes at the best Chelsea restaurants, French fare in the West Village and the best pastrami in NYC. We've even thrown in some of the best diners in NYC that make the mark. So whether you're looking for a late-night snack or a full on feast, there’s always something to curb your appetite, no matter what time it is.
This historic Jewish deli has been a centerpiece of New York food and culture since 1888. Open 24 hours on weekends, it's the perfect end (or beginning) to your evening with a crisp-skinned, all-beef hot dog and, of course, one of their legendary sandwiches. The thick-cut pastrami stacked high between slices of rye is hands down going to be the highlight of your evening. And since you're dining in late night, you'll probably need add on an egg cream to the order.
This Chelsea mainstay feeds visiting fashionistas and locals alike with a roster of down-home favorites. There are three versions of mac and cheese—the traditional is nearly perfect, with a crunchy top and loads of gooey fontina—and gravy-heavy meat loaf with tomato-and-red-pepper relish makes you wish Mom’s cooking were this good. If you’re on a liquid diet, skip the dining room altogether and head for the tiny basement bar.
NYPD Sergeant Abe “Sarge” Katz opened the restaurant in 1964, and it still has the same decor and charm, with a giant wall of celebrity photos to prove it. The menu is just as gargantuan as all the classic deli sandwiches. Whether you're in the mood for a jumbo bowl of matzo ball soup, or you're feeling like a large stack of pancakes is what your body needs, you really can't go wrong.
There's never a wrong time to head to Veselka for a meal, and that's probably why you’re always likely to find a crowd at this East Village staple. The 24-hour Ukrainian restaurant has been serving soul-warming Eastern European specialities since 1954, and it’s still going strong. Start with some soothing borscht soup before you tear into a link of kielbasa and a plate of steaming hot pierogi.
Chef Julian Medina puts a Latin-American spin on the classic 24-hour diner. Styled to evoke a luncheonette in Havana, the 70-seat space features a long marble bar with swivel stools, bright blue booths and red linoleum tables. You can cruise the region by exploring nightly specials like Mexican Tuesdays and Caribbean Sundays. Or choose from the everyday comfort-food menu of snacks, sandwiches, burgers or round-the-clock breakfast.
You better be hungry when you show up to this Koreatown stalwart. Starting with complimentary banchan—small plates like steamed eggs and kimchi—you'll graduate to the tradtional menu, packed with everything from protein-packed soups and stews to all of your grill-it-yourself BBQ needs. The 24-hour restaurant may be crowded, but you won't even notice as you binge on bubbling tofu stews and several variations of bibimbap.
While most people at 2am are rushing for a dollar slice, you're not like most people. Instead sit down for a civilized meal at this 24-hour bistro serving all the French classics that you'd want for a truly Parisian-style dinner. The only question left is whether to order the steak frites or the croque madame. (The correct answer is both.) And if you make it to 6am, you can add on anything from the breakfast menu.
Empanada Mama peddles more than 40 varieties of the main attraction, perfectly portable for on-the-go snacking. Fillings range from basic (plain cheese or rice and beans) to ultracreative (ham-cheese-and-pineapple) and sweetly addictive (banana–and–Belgian chocolate, or figs-caramel-and-cheese). It's just the fried sustenance you'll need after a night of drinking (or even if you're stone-cold sober).
If you like Korean but aren't into making your own, Han Bat is your round-the-clock spot: There’s no grilling at the table; your work is on the front end, figuring out what to order. The menu isn’t logically divided into courses, so the descriptions are indispensable—and often intriguing. You’ll just have to take your chances ordering dishes like Sam Gye Tang, where a small chicken is stuffed with glutinous rice, young ginseng shoots and jujubes.
While the menu isn't completely packed with Eastern European classics (you'll find a few Italian and Greek items), it's certainly what they've become famous for. Potato pancakes are crisp and golden, and the Romanian pastrami sandwich is salty, fatty and delicious. The stuffed cabbage is light and savory; pierogi and blintzes are deliciously substantial. They're open 24-hours every Friday through Sunday, making it the perfect spot to refuel after your weekend shenanigans in the East Village.
From gritty dives to bougie cocktail clubs, here are the best boozing options for thirsty night owls."
https://www.eater.com/2020/7/17/21328550/taco-bell-menu-changes-discontinuing-potato-items-quesarito-nachos-supreme,Eater,"It’s official: Taco Bell is axing all its potato dishes, among other offerings, in a big menu revamp scheduled for August 13.
There will be some new items available — a $5 Grande Nachos Box and a $1 Beef Burrito — but overall, this change represents a massive streamlining of the menu and restaurant operations. In recent months, fast-food chains like McDonald’s, as well as other restaurants, have made efforts to simplify their menus in order to trim costs during the pandemic. “[W]hile change is hard, a simplified menu and innovation process will leave room for new fan favorites, continued progress in categories such as plant-based diets, and even opportunities for the return of some classics on a limited time basis,” Taco Bell wrote in its release.
Change is hard, thanks! Especially for vegetarians and consumers with plant-based preferences, many of whom have embraced Taco Bell’s potato offerings as a rare alternative in a fast-food world awash with meat (both real and fake). Taco Bell will still serve beans, but sometimes you just want the carb-on-fat-on-carb hit of potatoes, cheese sauce, and sour cream wrapped inside a tortilla, you know?
The real solution, of course, is that more restaurants should probably incorporate a wider variety of non-meat options, especially considering the environmental and worker costs involved in the entire meat industry (and fast food in general).
But I’m not here to tell you how to grieve. Mourn if you must. Feel your pain. And the next time you hit up Taco Bell’s drive-thru at midnight, savor every bite of your Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes, because it may be the last time you taste them in their purest late-night fast-food form for a long time.
There may still be a faint spud-flavored reason not to despair, though. When reached for comment, a Taco Bell representative told Eater: “At this time, some restaurants have eliminated breakfast service based on reduced restaurant hours. While we don’t want to get your hopes up, there is always a possibility that potatoes would remain a key part of the breakfast daypart once business resumes.” That’s a whole lot of hedging, but too late: consider my hopes raised."

https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/where-s-the-cheapest-beer-in-the-world,Thrillist,"The only thing better than drinking a cold beer in a foreign land is drinking a six-pack for less than a fiver. And there're destinations across the globe where a big night's bar tab can be covered by the coins in your pocket. Where, perchance, are these magical places? Using crowd-sourced, cost-of-living site Numbeo.com, we narrowed it down to the top five -- salud!
NOTE: Countries are ranked by the average combined price of both a 16.9oz domestic draft beer from a bar, and the equivalent-sized bottle sold in a store.
5. EthiopiaAverage price for a pint: $0.93What you'll be drinking: Beer continues to gain popularity in Ethiopia, and there're plenty of local brews to choose from. Knock back a fair bit of St. George Beer (a refreshing lager named for the country's patron saint and brewed since the early '20s), Bedele pale lager, and Harar's popular stout. Ethiopia also brews a sweet 5.5% ABV lager dubbed Meta, totally sans irony.Pair it with: Hoppy lagers go well with Ethiopian cuisine, including traditional dishes like Doro Wat (chicken stew) or Yebeg Tibs (grilled lamb).
4. PhilippinesAverage price for a pint: $0.89What you'll be drinking: Two major brewers dominate the popular Filipino beer market -- San Miguel & Asia Brewery. San Miguel's Pale Pilsen's probably the most ubiquitous brew, but you'll also drink plenty of Red Horse (for as little as $0.50 a bottle) and Beer na Beer! Pale Pilsen, billed by AB as ""an excellent value for the money"".Pair it with: Filipinos love spit-roasting pig and pairing it with a cold brew. The stomach's usually stuffed with star anise and lemongrass. And be sure to try Sisig, an appetizer made from pork cheeks and liver.
3. UkraineAverage price for a pint: $0.89What you'll be drinking:  Not only are Ukrainian suds cheap ($0.58 a pint isn't unheard of), but more and more beer enthusiasts are vouching for their quality -- similar to Czech-style beers. You'll likely take down major national brews like Lvivske, Chernigivske, and Obolon.Pair it with: Ukrainians love their borshch, varenyky (stuffed dumplings), and home-made Kovbasa (sausage) -- and their beer works with all of it.
2. CambodiaAverage price for a pint: $0.88What you'll be drinking: While you'll find a cold one for as little as $0.50, odds are it's going to be one of several indistinguishable pale lagers: Angkor, Anchor Beer, Tiger, or Khmer Brewery's Cambodia.Pair it with: A plate of red tree ants. No, seriously. Cambodians traditionally stir fry them with beef, lemongrass, and basil.
1. VietnamAverage price for a pint: $0.76What you'll be drinking: Almost assuredly bia hoi, on ice. While $0.76 a pint is the overall average price for beer in Vietnam, it's pretty common to find a 12oz glass of this 3% ABV pale lager for as little as $0.20 cents. For the bottled alternative, go with the Bia Hà Nôi. Pair it with: Assuming you've had your fill of pho and bánh mì, try a glass with cá kho to (catfish cooked in a clay pot)."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/nycs-no-pants-subway-ride-officially-canceled,Thrillist,"Pull your pants back up and fasten your belt. This year, the annual ""No Pants Subway Ride"" event has been canceled.
Depending on where you stand on the decidedly odd event, this could either be awesome or terrible news. Just like last year, the event organizers from Improv Everywhere decided to call the initiative off, leaving no opportunity for wild New Yorkers to board trains without pants on.
The event had happened every year in January from 2002 until 2020, and participating New Yorkers and even tourists would hop on the subway wearing everything but pants. While the event is very much in line with NYC's bizarre everyday encounters and events, it doesn't solely belong to the Big Apple. In addition to NYC, the ""No Pants Subway Ride"" takes over 60 cities worldwide.
In the end, it is just another unusual way to have a laugh. ""The idea behind No Pants is simple: Random passengers board a subway car at separate stops in the middle of winter without pants,"" reads the Improv Everywhere website. ""The participants behave as if they do not know each other, and they all wear winter coats, hats, scarves, and gloves. The only unusual thing is their lack of pants."""
https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/taco-bell-potatoes-return-march-2021-what-to-order,Thrillist,"Thursday's a big day over at your local Taco Bell.
The Doritos Locos maker is set to unleash a new, extra-cheesy version of its Chalupa-quesadilla hybrid, the Quesalupa, on March 11. On the same day, the chain will finallyreinstate its beloved potatoes on the permanent menu nationwide after removing them back in August. There will be plenty to eat between the new and returning options, so you'd better roll up to the drive-thru with a solid plan for maximum potato enjoyment.
Potato bites are returning to the menu in the form of the Spicy Potato Soft Taco, a tortilla piled with the potatoes, lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, and creamy chipotle sauce, and Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes, which features the potatoes topped with sour cream and nacho cheese sauce and comes served in a little bowl. When asked by Thrillist, a Taco Bell spokesperson confirmed the potatoes are the same American Vegetarian Association-certified vegan ones as before—the company didn't tweak or update the recipe while they were away. Phew.
In addition to the two preconfigured potato-filled options, you can also get the crispy spuds as a substitute for the protein in other items across the menu or just as an add-on via simple customizations. There are near endless potato possibilities, but it looks like some are better—and more popular—than others.
Those are the most popular ways to do it, though nothing's stopping you from adding potatoes to other menu items. Adding potatoes will come with an extra charge, so it may be wise to stick with value menu items, such as the Beef Burrito ($1) to keep the price down. Adding Taco Bell's Nacho Fries to a Beef Burrito, for example, will set you back an extra 50 cents, so we imagine adding potato bites will cost about the same.
The best way to customize your order with potatoes—and order Taco Bell in general these days—is via the chain's mobile app. Instead of shouting your laundry list of add-on and substitutions out your car window, you can easily choose from all of the available customizations for each menu item, and place your order digitally for pickup. I did this the other day and grabbed my big bag of highly customized Crunchwraps in the drive-thru. It was a breeze."
https://www.eater.com/2019/6/13/18677402/burger-king-stranger-things-upside-down-whopper-door-dash,Eater,"With the premiere of Stranger Things Season 3 just a few weeks away, Netflix and Burger King are teaming up for a fast food stunt that seems aimed at the die-hard fans, only: At 11 locations across the country, the chain is adding an “Upside Down Whopper” to the menu, which is literally just a Whopper served upside down. No special Demagorgon sauce, Eggo bun, or Hopper’s bacon crumbles. It’s just an inverted hamburger in Stranger Things-branded packaging.
Usually these type of branded fast food deals are reserved for blockbuster movies and Disney franchises, not TV shows. But Stranger Things is a special case: According to the New York Times, Netflix has struck up deals with 75 brands to help promote the new season of its wildly popular supernatural thriller. Baskin-Robbins will be serving new flavors inspired by the Scoops Ahoy ice cream parlor in Season 3, and H&M is now selling a full line of retro Stranger Things-branded summer apparel. In addition to the Burger King app giveaway, Coca-Cola also brought back one of its biggest failures — New Coke — for a limited run timed with the return of the show. The extra-sweet soda appears throughout Season 3, and Coca-Cola is making 500,000 cans available for purchase on its website and in select vending machine across the country.
Netflix says that there’s no money changing hands for the Coke product placement in the series, although the entertainment giant will get cuts from merchandise sales of some of these branded products. The creators of the show, twin brothers Matt and Ross Duffer, tell the Times that they have no problem working with these brands, because the movies that inspired them as kids also involved similar partnerships. “When we were kids, we were obsessed with those self-lacing Nikes in Back to the Future Part II, and, of course, we loved that Elliott baited E.T. with Reese’s Pieces!” the brothers explain. “When we were kids, that simply made Elliott more relatable, more ordinary, more like us.” Much of Season 3 takes place in a shopping mall, so fans can expect to see plenty of cameos from brands past and present, including the Gap, WaldenBooks, and, of course, Burger King.
All 10 episodes of Stranger Things Season 3 will land on Netflix July 4."
https://www.eater.com/2020/3/6/21166944/david-chang-ugly-delicious-season-2-netflix-review,Eater,"This four-episode season of Ugly Delicious is filled with such moments of uncertainty. At first glance, two of the episodes — “Don’t Call It Curry,” about Indian food, and “As the Meat Turns,” about the collection of disparate cuisines that make up “Middle Eastern” food — seem like they could be slotted right into Season 1, which cohered around the shifting boundaries of of iconic dishes and cuisines, and a questioning of culinary “authenticity.” Really, though, if there’s one theme that undergirds this season, it’s that Chang is owning up to what he doesn’t know. That’s not an entirely novel development; as Helen Rosner writes for The New Yorker, “Chang’s appeal as a celebrity chef has always been his raw candor” and how he likes to “chew through thorny issues in public.” But here, Chang’s admissions of his own ignorance are imbued with a new thread of personal humility, forming the basis of a season in which Chang freely declares himself “that asshole” who knows nothing about Indian cooking, who mixes up Arab and Iranian cuisines, whose previously held notions of steak and politics are rendered, if not wrong, then at least further complicated. So please, the season’s ethos seems to say, watch him learn.
Part of that comes through in how Chang delegates his work to others this time around, sending even more of his friends and collaborators around the globe without him. In the third episode, “Steak,” some of the most memorable scenes take place with Chang nowhere to be found, like when artist David Choe enjoys a schvitz and steak in a Detroit bathhouse, or when writer and historian Lolis Eric Elie dines at the famous Bodega El Capricho in Spain. Rosner herself meanders across the green hills of a California ranch that touts happy cows and sustainable agricultural practices. The spectrum of guests lets the show go to more places and do more things this time around, while also appearing to address criticism of the first season of Ugly Delicious for a lack of diversity, particularly when it came to including women and black people.
Of course, the greatest unknown in the Ugly Delicious universe is what comes next for Chang. Can he continue to burn the candle at both ends as his life is shown on the precipice of a momentous change? In “Kids Menu,” he imagines two diverging paths: “I have a picture of me being a bad parent. I have a picture of me not being able to be present, me being on planes. The alternative is, I just want to make bento boxes for their school lunches. That would give me a lot of pleasure.” He doesn’t yet have an answer to this, either, but watching him work through it with naked vulnerability is the emotional peak of the season. It’s undeniably compelling to see a chef like Chang, often referred to in the press as a “bad boy” in the early days of his career, crying multiple times throughout the episode: while telling his parents over the phone that Grace is expecting; while talking about his friend Anthony Bourdain, whose death coincided with the the couple learning they were pregnant; while filming Grace in the hospital before the delivery, Chang’s sniffles audible from behind his phone camera.
All four episodes of Ugly Delicious Season 2 are now streaming on Netflix.

It's certainly not the end of the world, but it's an entirely unpleasant experience. During the busy, chaotic summer vacation months, delays are more common—especially in 2023 as levels of travel reach pre-pandemic levels.
Cirium, a company that evaluates airline and travel data, has the numbers on just how delayed flights were in July 2023, broken down by airline and airport. On the whole, airlines' overall on-time performance in North America dropped from June to July, from 68.11% to 65.82%. If these airlines were getting a grade, it would be a D.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/uncle-boons-beloved-modern-thai-restaurant-is-permanently-closed-081020,Timeout,"One of the city's best Thai restaurants showcased the Southeast Asian country's cuisine without watering down its recipes.
Ever since opening in 2013, diners packed into Ann Redding and Matt Danzer’s Nolita restaurant Uncle Boons. The chefs set a stage—one filled with vintage posters and some tiki bar touches—that showcased modern Thai dishes without watering them down. New Yorkers ate it up; they loved the complex (and often fiery) dishes served in the laid back, fun environment.
That all came to a halt in mid March and now Redding and Danzer have decided to close the restaurant permanently after not reaching an agreement with their landlord.
“COVID-19 has rocked our industry to the core, and we a small, family-owned business are no more immune to the realities that threaten restaurants, than any other shop,” they posted on the restaurant’s Instagram page.
Uncle Boons helped pave the way for Southeast Asian restaurants across the city. The married couple showed there was a demand for something more than your run-of-the-mill Thai takeout, and that curries, noodle soups and even fried rice could be cooked with modern touches without compromising authenticity. They eventually were rewarded with a Michelin star. Today, New York has a number of Asian restaurants with a similar MO: Ugly Baby (Time Out’s best restaurant in New York) in Carroll Gardens, Wayla in the Lower East Side and Soothr in the East Village are just a few.
Fans of Uncle Boons can still order similar dishes at their takeout joint Uncle Boons Sister. Redding and Danzer said they’ll be shifting their focus to Thai Diner, which already was popular for its mashup of Thai and American diner classics even though it was open for less than a month before all New York restaurants had to shut down indoor dining."

And at the Richardson Adventure Farm in Spring Grove, Illinois, you can enjoy the largest corn maze in the world. This year, the 28 acres of corn just about 65 miles northwest of downtown Chicago have been shaped into a Jurassic Park-themed maze that has nearly 10 miles of trails winding through the stalks. Here's what you need to know about the whole affair.
For starters, there are four smaller mazes that make up the entire Jurassic Park Maze—that way, if you don't have the time and endurance to get through 10 miles of trail, you can still enjoy it. There are also easy ways to leave the maze so that you can pop out and grab a donut or cup of hot chocolate.
Also worth noting are the wooden bridge checkpoints throughout the maze, which will let you look out over the maze to see where you're at and to take in the view. For the month of October, tickets will cost $24 on Thursdays and Fridays for people aged 13 and up, and $30 on Saturdays and Sundays. The maze is closed to visitors Monday through Wednesday. You can check out all of the ticket prices and additional details at RichardsonAdventureFarm.com.
There will also be a few nights this October where the maze will be open until midnight, for even more after dark fun. The maze will be open late on both October 27 and October 28, 2023, a.k.a. the pre-Halloween weekend. On October 15, the maze will also be home to the Corn Maze 5K Run and a one-mile kids run. The race will benefit Trees for Troops.
A little after Halloween, there will still be a chance to enjoy the maze. On November 4, the maze will be open to horseback riders and their steeds, for only $12! In addition to the corn maze, Richardson Adventure Farm offers tons of other activities, including train and wagon rides, ziplining, and games.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/believe-it-or-not-new-york-raccoons-are-about-to-get-vaccinated-091522,Timeout,"As you might’ve guessed—it’s rabies.
In today’s local animal news: New York City raccoons are the subject of the latest vaccine drive to eradicate rabies.
According to city officials, a total of 18 NYC animals have tested positive for the deadly virus—and not just raccoons. Two skunks in the Bronx were infected, as were a couple of bats and a cat on Staten Island. COVID-19, move away: rabies is back in town!
How is the city going to vaccinate the mammals? The Health Department explained that small, brown baits will be dispersed throughout wooded areas in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. The oral vaccines, which reportedly smell like fish and release a pink liquid when chewed on, will be dropped at these bait stations beginning this week through October.
Next month, a helicopter will fly over and drop the baits throughout marshy areas on Staten Island as well.
NBC4 reports that the bait isn't harmful but the liquid inside of it can cause vomiting if ""pets eat several of them."" Too bad there's no way to warn the animals not to over-indulge.
A few things to keep in mind: if you do see a raccoon (which you really shouldn't, unless it's extremely dark out), stay out of its way. Do not try to feed it, pet it, play with it or interact with it in any way. You obviously don't want to be infected with rabies after the years we've just spent dealing with a horrific virus that changed the way we live all across the world.
If you happen to come into contact with the actual oral vaccine, do not panic. Officials advise to wash your hands immediately and, if you feel the need to, call your doctor or the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 as a precaution. The inoculation may cause a rash, but that's unlikely.
As usual, we’d love to warn everyone to just stay safe."

If you don't want to miss out on dance music and your favorite DJ sets, though, you might be in luck.
SILO, a new dance music club with a capacity of only 500 people, is opening in Brooklyn on February 10. Located at 90 Scott in East Williamsburg just a few steps from the other popular venue 99 Scott, the new venue is the brainchild of NYC promoter duo Alex Neuhausen and Lilly Wolfson.
The immersive, carbon-neutral club will bring guests into a meticulously designed space featuring multi-genre music. Hosting international DJs and producers, SILO will deliver a multi-sensory experience representing the full spectrum of dance music and its communities, and with no defining genre or BPM, it will explore sound in every direction.
Music purists will also be happy to know that the club will host vinyl-only nights as well. ""We want to be a home for a scene,"" said Neuhausen in a statement. ""We want to be the spot that 20 years from now, people say 'I was there and saw so and so spin their first set in the front room of SILO.'""
A converted hangar, SILO encapsulates the industrial design vibes to a T, but it also features refined and hip looks. ""I wanted the space to have an elevated, polished look while still keeping the industrial aura,"" said Wolfson, who also designed the club's interior. ""It's very structured and clean, but I don't want it to feel like a club. I want people to forget where they are. I intentionally left the graffiti on the exterior to keep it nondescript.""
Upon taking to the dancefloor, guests will be surrounded by a fully custom lighting and a high-contrast projection system that will form a seamless 8K image mapped both on the ceiling's vault and on the walls.
During the first month, an exciting lineup of DJs is already set to welcome clubbers into the space. Josh Wink and the acid techno sounds of Hiroko Yamamura will transport you into their world, and there will also be a special all-nighter with Eli Escobar."

Whether or not you think that the awards are too highbrow, too European or too dwindling in relevancy, there’s no denying the clout that the big fat white man mascot still holds. Plus, those little stars can have a huge impact on a restaurant’s footfall, which is especially important right now after years of turbulence thanks to the pandemic, not to mention inflation, and rising food and energy costs.
As any proud London foodie knows, the capital is home to a wealth of brilliant restaurants. So it’s no surprise that London’s dining rooms usually occupy a good chunk of Michelin’s list. This year, there are four new one-star restaurants in the capital and two new two-stars. No new three stars were awarded in London this year.
Only one restaurant has been given the proverbial chop and lost a star: Seven Park Place in Mayfair. Sadly one of the restaurants that held a Michelin star in 2022 has permanently closed: The Glasshouse in Kew.
Here’s the full list of new Michelin stars for London restaurants, and who’s in, and who’s out.
In addition to the top awards, a number of London restaurants were awarded Bib Gourmands last week. The list includes Evernight in Battersea, Hām in West Hampstead, Plaza Khao Gaeng on Oxford Street and The Pelican in Notting Hill.
Only one London restaurant has lost a Michelin star this year. Seven Park Place in St James’s retained its Michelin star in 2022, but does not appear on the list this year.
London is home to 74 Michelin-star restaurants. So, you’ve got plenty of choice if you’re after a fancy meal out.
Five out of the eight restaurants awarded three Michelin stars in the UK and Ireland are in the capital. This includes Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester on Park Lane, Core by Clare Smyth in Notting Hill, Hélène Darroze at The Connaught in Mayfair, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea and Sketch (The Lecture Room & Library) in Mayfair.

https://www.timeout.com/news/are-popeyes-new-chicken-nuggets-worth-the-hype-072721,Timeout,"So, how do Popeyes' new chicken nuggets stack up? At first glance, they look incredibly encouraging – the breading is craggy, thick and golden, just like the promotional images promise. You can get 'em in orders of eight, 12, 24, 36 and 48 (!!) or opt for a smaller serving by ordering a kids meal (four or six pieces).
For reference, here's what a box of 12 looks like IRL; not pictured: two sauces, a biscuit, fries and a soda – all of which is included in the small combo, priced at $8.89.
Unfortunately, my first bite was a total miss – the chicken was thick and rubbery, and the breading felt inexplicably flimsy. Things only got better from there, with the second and third nuggets revealing tender, juicier white meat. But even then, the hand-battered buttermilk breading felt loose, peeling away from the meat and crumbling in my hands with every bite.
Do Popeyes' chicken nuggets taste just like the brand's fan-favorite fried chicken sandwich? While I have no doubt that the kitchen is using the same breading technique on these poppable bites, the real beauty of the sandwich is in the sum of its parts – the pillowy brioche bun, craggy fried chicken, zippy pickles and creamy sauce. Nuggets are a different beast, even when they're dunked in loads of sauce and served with fries.
If you've impatiently scrolled to the bottom of this article for my final verdict, here it is: Popeyes' new chicken nuggets are decent (good even!), especially if you like seeing real white breast meat in your fast food. Are they revolutionary? Eh. Will they start a chicken nugget war? Only time will tell.
If you find yourself cruising through the Popeyes drive-thru this week, try the chicken nuggets in the kids meal – then, toss in what you really came for: the unbeatable fried chicken sandwich."
https://www.eater.com/2017/1/17/14248802/chicken-nuggets-ranked-fast-food-mcnugget,Eater,"NoNo food is perfect, but the masterpiece of molecular gastronomy known as chicken nugget is aggressively imperfect. This is by design. Say what you will about the McDonald’s Quarter Pounder; the hamburger patty is made of nothing but USDA-inspected beef. The McNugget, by contrast, is an amalgamation of over 20 discrete ingredients — rib meat, breast meat, botanicals, chicken skin, sodium phosphates, autolyzed yeast extract, sodium acid pyrophosphate, safflower oil, dextrose, and other oddities — that are mixed, cut, molded, and fried in vegetable oil laced with the ominous-sounding (but innocuous) anti-foaming agent known as dimethylpolysiloxane.
And yet, the McNugget is the more delicious creation. Biting into a Quarter Pounder mimics the sensation of chomping down on an oil-soaked sponge. But dipping the engineered and salted protein disc that is the McNugget into a peel-away plastic-container filled with pure honey (and nothing else) is nearly a peerless fast-food experience. Until you try a better version at Wendy’s.
I’ll take a chicken nugget any day over a chicken tender. If the tender is more pure product, more Jonathan Waxman, the nugget is more food science, more Wylie Dufresne, more manipulation — a polite way of saying more processed. It is cooking as transformation. It is more charcuterie than steak (albeit more mystery meat than artisanal sausage). The nugget is a dish that most high-minded establishments (or weeknight cooks) shy away from. The nugget, with its multisyllabic emulsifiers and stabilizers, is almost exclusively the domain of fast food.
The nugget is a gateway drug, a young child’s unwitting indoctrination into the corporate culinary industrial complex. I knew what a nugget was long before I was introduced to kale or capon. In fact, it is one of the first two dishes I remember eating on this earth (the other dish was baked Peconic Bay scallops, a dish that fits my lifetime narrative more elegantly).
The nugget is a mysterious MRE-style foodstuff that restaurants can serve, with minimal outrage, in the shape of a disc, star, fry, doughnut, and, in the case of a Taco Bell item that’s being test-marketed in areas of the country with a lower density of full-time food writers, a nacho chip. That’s right, a nacho chip made from chicken. I can’t wait to try it.
1. Pure Honey (McDonald's): There's nothing better to cut through the saltiness of a nugget.
2. Sweet Heat (Popeyes): The hottest ""sweet"" sauce I've sampled at a fast-food outlet. Finishes with a gorgeously bitter olive note.
3 (tie). Ranch (Popeyes): The creamiest and tangiest of the ranch dressings.
3 (tie). Ranch (Chick-Fil-A): Perhaps a touch thicker than Popeye's ranch, with distinct garlic and onion overtones that recall the classic Doritos chip.
4. Nacho Cheese (White Castle): Thick, melty, nacho cheese; it would've ranked higher if there was a heat element.
5. Tartar Sauce (Popeyes): Creamy white sauce with an assertive punch of dill.
6. Buffalo Sauce (Chick-Fil-A): More acidic and spicy than the McDonald's Buffalo sauce, and closer to the New York original that goes on wings.
7. Mardi Gras Mustard (Popeye's): The only fast food mustard sauce I know of that actually tastes like mustard.
8. Sriracha (Wendy's): Bit of an unwelcome sour note up front, but the heat becomes intense as you continue to dip.
*McDonald's Sweet and Sour and Chick-Fil-A’s nugget sauce didn't make the list after it was determined they weren't good enough to recommend at all.
This is my fifth fast-food review for Eater — or sixth, if you count David Chang’s quick-service NYC spot Fuku. I cover these venues for a simple reason: People eat at them. Show up at a Wendy’s in New York at 11:30 p.m. on a weeknight and you’ll wait in line. Having spent a bit of time at various outposts of Popeyes, Burger King, and elsewhere, I can say without equivocation that you’ll encounter a more diverse crowd there than you would at most of the restaurants we critics cover.
None of this is to gloss over the machinations of fast food, an industry that has historically paid its workers so poorly that New York felt compelled to create a separate, higher minimum wage for staffers at White Castle, Wendy’s and elsewhere, currently set at $12/hour. (Nationwide, the average wage of a fast-food cook is about $9.50/hour, less than $20,000/year.) It’s also an industry known for dumping fat and sugar–laden fare, on the cheap, in communities that lack a variety of healthier options.
But a high-minded film reviewer can keep his soul while finding humanity in Furious 7 (or vacuity in The Avengers); a food critic is surely capable of the same balancing act while assessing the Hollywood of the culinary world. If my profession hopes to stay relevant to diners for whom $20 represents dinner for two (rather than a single cocktail), it would be well served to offer advice on not just ambitious local venues or jet-set destination spots, but also the ubiquitous and accessible chains, places where millions of Americans go for dinner, leave happy, and return for breakfast the next day.
9. White Castle Chicken Pretzel Donut Shaped Rings: A hybrid of three completely unrelated foodstuffs — or four, if you count the nacho sauce that it’s paired with. They taste like neither chicken nor pretzels, and while each ring is shaped like a doughnut, it’s not clear why flattening chicken parts into a circular shape is more conducive to deliciousness than a nugget. The ring is predictably crunchy, but it’s also the only pretzel product I know of that lacks most maltiness and saltiness. It is uniquely awful. What’s worse: While smaller sizes are available, the default order is 20 rings ($5), which explains the heart-stopping nutritional information you’re about to see: Calories: 1,760. Fat: 158g. Sodium: 2,020mg.
8. Burger King Classic Nuggets: No good. This is a disappointment, since some of my fondest fast-food chicken memories come from digging into a juicy Burger King chicken sandwich while wearing a golden paper crown. These aren’t nuggets you’d describe as having any type of compelling crunch, moisture, or texture; the flavor evokes a watered-down version of the KFC spice mix. The nuggets smell like a mix of fries and wood chips; when you eat them, they leave behind a dusty residue, as if you just dredged your fingers through a carpenter’s workshop. Calories (six nuggets): 260. Fat: 16g. Sodium: 470mg.
7. KFC Popcorn Nuggets: When I first tried this novelty in the 1990s, I literally ended up with a box of fried chicken “crust.” There was almost no discernible meat. I now cherish that memory, because I like to think of it as an early encounter with the currently-in-vogue practice of selling repurposed food waste. Two decades later, there’s more fowl in this perennial novelty, but the main draw of popcorn chicken isn’t the chicken, but the popcorn — the spiced crust. It’s an easy way to obliterate your palate with the Colonel’s secret blend of herbs and spices — monochromatic onion powder, garlic powder, and enough salt to send a racehorse into AFib. After each bite, an eerie metallic tang lingers in my mouth. And true to form, some nuggets don’t appear to contain a modicum of fowl. My kidneys hurt afterward. Calories: 620. Fat: 39g. Sodium: 1,820mg.
6. White Castle Chicken Donut Rings: The second-best nugget for dipping after the McDonald’s version, thanks to its marked lack of spices, or quite frankly, flavor. This creation isn’t nearly as crispy as the fast-food chain’s pretzel donut rings, but are distinctly meatier and plumper. The right move here is to pair the rings with White Castle’s recommended side: warm nacho cheese sauce ($0.65), which adds a gorgeous wallop of, well, warm nacho cheesiness. Note that White Castle’s most prominent beverage offering at the moment is two cans of Monster Energy for $4, which is a great deal if you enjoy knocking back a NyQuil-flavored beverage to overdose of caffeine. Calories: 530. Fat: 47g. Sodium: 610mg.
5. Burger King Chicken Fries: Like a mini Slim Jim made of chicken, this is really a gorgeous way to serve a nugget — even if it’s not a nugget, as it maximizes the ratio of crispy coating to MSG-laced meat. The bronzed exterior is spiked with onion, paprika, turmeric (!!!), and a separate application of monosodium glutamate (why not). The heat is gentle but persistent, like a marked dose of white pepper. They’re paired with a concoction known only as “chicken fry sauce,” which I suppose is a helpful name if you’re blackout drunk while piloting a Medevac helicopter and you need to figure out which of the eight sauces in your bag REALLY goes with the chicken fries. No matter, chicken fries are best enjoyed like regular fries, with nothing on them, as they’re fast-food perfection in their own right. Calories (nine fries): 280. Fat: 17g. Sodium: 850mg.
4. Popeyes Chicken Nuggets: A true popcorn nugget by texture; this is by far the crunchiest and juiciest specimen, with a gentle but noticeable cayenne kick on the finish. Just one issue: When I place my nose over the nuggets, the sensation that follows is akin to inhaling year-old potato chips that’ve been microwaved in plastic wrap. I thought about penalizing Popeyes for this, but a well-respected food writer tells me it “smells like home,” citing it as the chain’s signature scent. Alas, I grew more accustomed to the bespoke odor during a second visit. These aren’t as seasoned as Popeyes’s traditional cajun blend, unfortch, but that can be corrected with the intensely spicy sweet heat dipping sauce. Calories: 230. Fat: 14g. Sodium: 350mg.
3. Chick-Fil-A Nuggets: What you’d expect at a high school in a high-income zip code whose cafeteria adopted the simulacrum of healthiness. These aren’t so much nuggets as they are knobs of irregularly cut breast meat with a light coating of nearly crispy breadcrumbs — a true sheep in wolf’s clothing. They sport a nutty sweetness from the peanut oil fry and an aggressive salinity from over-seasoning. It’s all very Shake ‘n Bake, which is to say all very average, though average is a compliment in the overall junk food spectrum. Calories (standard size): 260. Fat: 12g. Sodium: 990mg.
2. McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets: So handsomely blonde, it’s as if you’re eating a golden lab. I’m tempted to say the delicate crunch evokes good tempura, but one of the four nuggets in my order was gnarled, almost as if it was partially chewed before frying. The texture is pure Goldilocks, not quite firm but not entirely squishy, and the flavor is distinctly neutral; without any overtones of pepper, garlic, or spice. There is no aftertaste. This is without a doubt the vodka of the nugget world, a plain, sometimes too plain conduit for other flavors. Pros know that the best of those conduits is pure honey; the musky mead is fine counterpoint to saltiness of the chicken. Calories (six nuggets): 280. Fat: 18g. Sodium: 540mg.
The morsels weren’t any less compelling when I ordered them in Midtown Manhattan last week: exceedingly crunchy (like eating cereal) and almost too warm to eat. The interior texture of both varieties are as soft as weisswurst, with a pleasantly salty exterior (and juicier interior) on the classic nugget. The spicy nugget assaults the diner with a level of heat that builds and stings like no other dish in the modern fast-food industry, even at Taco Bell. The cayenne sucker punch lasts for a solid 30 seconds. It calls for a good Riesling or an ice-cold beer. Calories (regular, six nuggets): 270. Fat: 19g. Sodium: 580mg. Calories (spicy, six nuggets): 280. Fat: 17g. Sodium: 720mg."
https://www.eater.com/ad/22677833/new-yorks-bacon-egg-and-cheese,Eater,"An ode to the sandwich that gets us out of bed in the morning.
InIn New York, breakfast is as diverse as the millions of people calling the state home, but one staple is cherished from Brooklyn to Buffalo: the bacon, egg, and cheese. I remember the first time I ordered one. It was an early morning, years ago, in my second week of living in the city. I had a trial shift to be a server at an upscale steakhouse in Hell’s Kitchen and desperately needed something to calm my hunger, and nerves, before starting the 1-train journey downtown. I ran down the vaguely uneven stairs of my apartment building, barreled out the front door, and stepped into the bodega across the street. As someone who typically doesn’t eat much in the early mornings, I intended to only grab a granola bar and a coffee. But once I smelled the bacon sizzling on the grill, I reconsidered. A couple minutes later I continued my walk to the train, peeled back the foil holding the layered sandwich, and bit into my first bacon, egg, and cheese.
Having grown up in the South, I had eaten plenty of breakfast sandwiches before (the most common being fried chicken on a buttery, honey-coated biscuit or a sausage, egg, and cheese on the same). But this foil-wrapped sandwich couldn’t have been more different. Living in Manhattan’s Washington Heights at the time, the bodega man slathered mayoketchup (the Puerto Rican classic I grew up pairing with tostones and mofongo) on the roll as the last assembly step, adding a slightly tangy kick to the already salty and savory meal. I had hit the breakfast jackpot.
The way it’s ordered varies by customer — some adding ketchup with salt and pepper, others choosing hot sauce or even jelly — but the feeling of bliss that hits once you bite into it is universal. Whether you’re adding some fuel to an early morning, need something quick and easy, or simply just wake up craving it, the no-frills sandwich is a go-to.
Julia Black, another Brooklyn-based New Yorker, has tried to master the art of the at-home BEC but hasn’t found success. “I make them all the time (two eggs, American cheese, two pieces of bacon, everything bagel), but I’ve never been able to match the real bodega deal,” she says. “The gooeyness, the way the layers meld like a cutaway of ancient rock… my bacon is never as crispy. My favorite is eating a BEC after a hard workout when my stomach is a bottomless pit.” She DM’s me a photo of the many layers of a rock formation. “How BEC layers should look, for reference,” she jokes.
Trying to find one across the state isn’t hard. Not just served at bodegas, corner delis, or sidewalk carts, the BEC can be found on menus at New York diners, coffee shops, cafes, and virtually anywhere serving breakfast. And as more chefs attempt more adventurous approaches, the sandwich has faced tweaks and rebrands along the road. The typical roll or bagel is being swapped with a milk bun, croissant, biscuit, or brioche. The American cheese is replaced by Swiss, pepper jack, or havarti. Add-ons like avocado, hash browns, or pickled onions are added to the layers, stuffing the sandwich further.
Whether you agree with the varied modification or not, each variation has its fan. The inventive approaches are either loved or hated, because the staple doesn’t need the add-ons or perceived upgrades. The charm of the greasy sandwich is its straightforward nature, reliability, and comfort — that’s the beautiful thing about the BEC.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/you-can-now-take-the-nyc-ferry-straight-to-the-rockaways-072022,Timeout,"The NYC Ferry is offering a direct trip to the Rockaways on summer weekends.
Getting to the Rockaways for a beach day no longer requires long, multi-line subway rides. NYC Ferry has just announced a new express route that’ll pick up beachgoers in Manhattan and bring them straight to Rockaway for just $8 a ticket.
Starting this weekend on Saturday, July 23, the Rockaway Rocket will take riders from Pier 11/Wall St. to Rockaway Beach 108th Street at Beach Channel Drive every Saturday, Sunday and holiday through September 11. There are no stops in between!
Riders can reserve departures from Wall Street/Pier 11 at 9:30am, 11:30am and 1:30pm and departures from Rockaway at 2:30pm, 4:30pm and 6:30pm.
The new service is $8 and requires a separate, reservation/ticket—meaning you’ll need to pay $2.75 to ride or transfer onto another NYC Ferry route. Plus, each Rockaway Rocket ride is $8 one-way, so you’ll need to purchase another ticket to return to Manhattan.
Once at Beach 108th Street, you can take a $2.75 bus to any of the other beaches.
The new service comes after Mayor Eric Adams announced that the fare for the NYC Ferry will climb to $4 per ride (up from $2.75) for “tourists and infrequent riders” starting September 12. The move was expected given that the ferry, which is subsidized, actually costs $12.88 per trip even though riders have been paying just $2.75, meaning that the city underreported about $244 million worth of expenses since 2015, according to Gothamist.
Whatever the reason, having a direct trip to the Rockaways is super helpful for those of us who want a beach day this summer. That being said, the sharks have other plans—all of Rockaway Beach was closed to swimming yesterday due to shark sightings.
Hopefully, the rest of the summer will be shark free so we can hop aboard this rad Rockaway Rocket!"
https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/chick-fil-as-secret-a-list-rewards-program,Thrillist,"Seeing as you eat at Chick-fil-A more than you'd like to admit, you'd probably know if the fried chicken sandwich giant offered a rewards program, right? Well, it turns out Chick-fil-A has had a secret and super-exclusive rewards club for years now, and despite many people's religious devotion to fast food chain, almost no one knows about it.
In fact, Chick-fil-A has offered the exclusive loyalty program, or its ""A-List"" club (see what they did there?!), since 2013. As explained in a report by CNBC, the program rewards the chain's VIP customers with perks like free food, discounts, private tours of its restaurants, and invites to special events. Only about 1,100 of the Georgia-based company's more than 2,000 locations currently participate in the program. Additionally, the CNBC report goes on to claim that unlike every other quick service chain's rewards program, you have to be invited by a Chick-fil-A employee to become a member. Well, crap.
Obviously, we had to find out more about this supposedly elite squad of chicken sandwich-eaters, and it turns out the club isn't as exclusive as the initial reports would have you believe. But admittedly, it's still cool.
""Customers are invited by franchisees to register which, in turn, allows the local restaurant team to get to know the customer better,"" Carrie Kurlander, Chick-fil-A's VP of Public Relations and Public Affairs, said in a statement via email. ""Customers can also request to join the A-list at their local restaurant. Once registered, the customer then experiences more customized rewards and communication from his or her local restaurant.""
Basically, the ""A-List"" club isn't so much a company-wide rewards program as much is it is a tactic some Chick-fil-A restaurants use to build relationships with customers -- aka motivate them to keep coming back for more fried chicken sandwiches.
""The A-list program is one of a number of ideas deployed by local franchisees that create ‘surprise and delight’ experiences for Chick-fil-A customers,"" Kurlander said. ""Our local franchisees are involved in their local communities, and they believe that relationships with customers go much deeper than transactions.""
In other words, you shouldn't feel left out. Well, at least not too much. This is especially true, considering Chick-fil-A also says ""changes are coming soon"" to the program, which means details about the current ""A-List"" could actually be out of date sometime in the near future.
""Exciting technology-based updates are in the works that we think will create an even better experience for our guests, and we look forward to sharing that story with you in the future!"" Kurlander said. ""Stay tuned.""
Never has a rewards program at a fast-food chicken sandwich shop sounded so... eh, who are we kidding? You'll probably just eat the chicken sandwiches and waffles fries anyway.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/this-street-in-brooklyn-has-officially-been-renamed-little-bangladesh-102122,Timeout,"The re-naming pays homage to the neighborhood's population.
A section of McDonald Avenue in Brooklyn's Kensington neighborhood will forever be known as Little Bangladesh following an official co-naming ceremony that took place a few days ago.
Estimated to be the home of 35% of the city's Bangladeshi population, the neighborhood is filled with restaurants and cafes that pay homage to the culture so it should come as no surprise that officials have found a way to pay tribute to the residents of the area.
""Nearly 40 years ago Shahid Ullah and the late Abdul Kashem opened Asian Oriental Grocery in Kensington, Brooklyn—this was the then very small but growing Bangladeshi community's lifeline to halal meat, Deshi vegetables, our spices and more,"" council member Shahana Hanif, who unveiled the street sign after proposing the co-naming back in April, wrote in an Instagram post following the ceremony. ""This shop made it so that families no longer had to travel to Queens or elsewhere. It made Kensington the neighborhood for Bangladeshi working class families to build a family and community.""
The politician went on to write that the new street moniker empowers the community ""to continue advocating and organizing for a dignified life—dignified housing, dignified workplaces and wages, and dignified education and more. It is to recognize the many struggles of those who arrived to Brooklyn 40 or so years ago, crossing harsh terrain from Sandwip, Noakhali, Chittagong and facing even harsher terrain here, and it is to celebrate our community's accomplishments and resilience.""
This, of course, isn't the first time that city officials opt to re-name a specific area to honor a portion of history. Back in August, for example, a street in Harlem was renamed after Althea Gibson, the first Black tennis player to win a Grand Slam title. A month later, a portion of 101st Street, between Third and Lexington Avenues in East Harlem, became Cicely Tyson Way, after the iconic actress. What's more, the Cort Theatre on Broadway last year became the James Early Jones Theatre in an homage to the iconic Black stage and screen actor."

https://www.thrillist.com/eat/new-york/best-24-hour-restaurants-in-nyc-late-night-food,Thrillist,"In the “city that never sleeps,” finding food at all hours is easy as big apple pie. But too often, your options seem limited to a floppy dollar slice, the contents of a street cart’s styrofoam clamshell, or a regrettable combo under a fast food joint’s sterile lighting. Come the witching hour, pickings for a place with seating and silverware may have slimmed, but in true New York fashion, an assortment of dependable and delicious restaurants are still just a jaunt away.
Regardless of your reasons for being up at an ungodly hour, below you’ll find a cross section of locations, cuisines, and price points. And these are places that stay open, not just late, but 24 hours a day. Sure, diners usually keep a candle burning for the late crowd -- you’ll find a few here. But maybe you’re in the mood for a little more. Maybe you’ve got a hankering for pierogi, cake, lengua, or kimchi. If it’s past your bedtime, you’re awake, and your tummy’s rumbling, look no further. Here are NYC’s best 24-hour restaurants.
South Park Slope$It’s nearly 5am, you want both Mexican food and baked goods -- what do you do? You head to Girasol Bakery where the tortillas and many of the confections are made on-premises. It’s a lunchtime cafeteria-esque space, so you won’t want to lounge too long, but in the wee hours, you’ll feel at home with a steak torta con todo filled with onions, pickled jalapeño, refried beans, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and melted queso. Add a slice of Oreo cake for dessert.
Murray Hill$$-$$$Sarge’s is the kind of spot your family goes to after shul; the go-to for shiva catering when great uncle Herman finally checks out. Aside from geshmak standard diner fare, Sarge’s prototypical Jewish deli has smoked fish, liverwurst, softball-size coldcut sandwiches, pickles, rye bread for days, and some of the city’s best New York cheesecake. There’s ample space in the dining room with delightfully squeaky vinyl banquettes, so when the 4am yen for a knish and egg cream hits, Sarge’s salvation awaits.
Elmhurst$-$$A shining glass, chrome, and neon beacon in the Queens night, Georgia Diner feels precisely like a greasy spoon should. Replete with approximately one million places to sit, spinning cake display, and tome of a menu, this is the quintessential diner experience imitated by the likes of IHOP -- one that’s become all too rare in NYC these days. If you’re craving filet of sole, knock yourself out, but breakfast staples are your golden ticket here.
Gramercy$$This 24/7 French bistro on Park Avenue is just five blocks from Union Square’s massive subway interchange. Its plentiful tables may be candlelit, but le ambiance is casual. L’Express doesn’t serve alcohol from 4-8am, but its “graveyard menu” proffers French staples like croque madame with creamy béchamel, gruyère, ham, and a fried egg; fresh salad niçoise, and peppery steak au poivre.
Flushing$$Mouthwatering Korean Barbecue served in stylish environs -- if only all 24-hour restaurants were this good. Along with complimentary pickled veg, your funky, savory favorites are all here, including bibimbap with chewy caramelized rice, veggies, and a fried egg; scrumptious beef bulgogi, and warming soondubu jjigae (silken tofu stew). The place has plenty of table seating and a friendly, attentive staff. The portions are sizeable, so plan on sharing.
Chelsea$This place is Americana just awaiting your arrival. Late night vibes are right out of a Hopper painting; recalling a bygone era. If you can find one on the weekends, your counter seat will face donuts of every shape, size, and filling, confections (get the black & white cookie), and coffee. Some savory selections like egg sandwiches and a few classic simple lunch-y offerings like chicken salad, grilled cheese, or a turkey club are also available.
Cobble Hill$-$$This lowkey neighborhood pillar’s portions of Middle Eastern fare are as generous as they are delicious. Standbys like falafel, shawarma, and hummus with rashoosh (tandoori flatbread) stand out, and the lamb haneeth, and roasted chicken are spicy, hearty and delicious. It isn’t a big place, but seats are easy to come by late at night.
East Village, Manhattan$$Veselka has has had many a star turn on the big and small screen, but word-of-mouth is what has kept it downtown Manhattan’s after-hours Ukranian comfort food/diner destination for 65 years. They know what they’re doing; the “you-should-be-sleeping-but-since-you’re-not” menu from midnight to sunup every Friday & Saturday features a pierogi platter, latkes, egg sandwich and -- yes, oh yes -- a patty melt. You may encounter a smattering of drunks in the spacious glassed-in dining room, but those who eat in 24-hour glass diners shouldn’t throw stones.
Chelsea$$$White on white on white, this popular weekend night spot almost looks like Apple’s idea of a 24/7 diner. Everything on the menu is carefully executed, but we’re not talking pinkies-out fancy. Sure, there’s asparagus with parm gremolata, PEI mussels, and sweet pea ravioli at dinner, but you can also nosh on several mac & cheese varieties, meatloaf, burgers, and the usual breakfast suspects into the wee hours.
Fresh Meadows$Bagel Oasis has been handmaking its rings of perfection since the '60s, and while what you’ll get between 3-4am isn’t freshly baked, toast your bagel of choice and slap on some schmear  (or eggs and cheese, or cold cuts) and you’ll be carb-loading with the best of ‘em. There are only a couple of small tables, but you’ll likely secure a spot any (late) night of the week.
Hell’s Kitchen$Empanadas may be the perfect late night food; handheld, flaky, chewy, and available in staggering variety. Empanada Mama’s pernil is plump with slow-roasted pork, the shrimp and crab ‘Viagra’ is a flavor explosion, and the oven-baked spinach and feta is delectable and healthy (ish). There’s plenty of counter and table seating in the pink “Mama loves you” neon glow, so take your time.
East Village$This inexpensive, vegetarian-friendly gem has been a favorite of both local night owls and NYC’s cab drivers for more than 20 years. $5 buys a bowl of rice and a spicy selection of yummy curried veggies. There is but one seat outside, so plan to eat standing at the back counter or find a nearby stoop.
Chelsea$$It may look like a typical diner from the outside, but Coppelia sets itself apart with a menu of inventive Latin specialties sure to slake after-hours appetites. The Mac & Chicarron is a pitch perfect mix of pork belly and gooey cheese, and the lomo saltado (Peruvian stir-fry) is chock-full of skirt steak, red onion, tomato, and fries. Coppelia has DJs weekend nights, brunch 10am-4pm Saturday & Sunday, and a gamely cocktail bar if you’re there before 4am.
Bushwick/Williamsburg, Brooklyn$Two locations of this Brooklyn mini-chain supply sumptuous Latin victuals 24/7. A newer construction, The Bushwick location has virtually no decor and few counter seats. The Williamsburg location has more character, recalling an old-school luncheonette with a handful of built-in stools. Each location’s service is fast and the food makes a late night snack into a feast; plates of goat, roast pork, beef stew, and half chicken are all served with heaping portion of rice and beans for less than $10.
Everywhere$Sometimes there’s an itch that can only be scratched by a bodega sandwich, bag of chips, and a soda. One of NYC’s great virtues is that it’s rich with bodegas ready and able to feed a nocturnal/hungry populace. Yes, they range vastly in quality and price. No, there’s probably no place to sit. But odds are you’re never more than five blocks from what is, all things considered, a valid 24/7 option.
West Village, Manhattan$$Okay, this one is cheating. Last call at Corner Bistro is 4am, so it’s not a 24-hour spot. But c’mon. It’s an estimable West Village bar that just happens to have a perfect bacon cheeseburger and little pints of McSorley’s ale for $5 available at 3am -- ask for more and you’re getting greedy. The barroom has a few tables and there’s more in the back, but you can expect a wait on weekends when Village revelers get the drunchies. Go during the week for late-night burger bliss."

The chain has managed, through what we can only assume is careful tinkering, to combine the two most popular dishes in the Italian culinary world -- pizza and pasta -- into a single item. The Meatball Pizza Bowl is basically a flakey, baked pizza crust filled with cheese, meat, and sauce, available at all Olive Garden locations for the matinee price of $8.99. An Olive Garden spokesperson confirmed that this thing comes topped with 10 meatballs and weighs in at over a pound. Simply put, it is large and meant specifically to get you full without making a dent in your wallet.
While not as substantial as a Never Ending Pasta Pass, the Meatball Pizza Bowl is nothing to be trifled with in respect to portion size. It's being introduced as the newest addition to the Lunch Duos menu, which will enable you to pair it with unlimited salad and breadsticks, which is the Olive Garden way.
Though it looks like a dish worthy of mopping up your weekend hangover, the Meatball Pizza Bowl is only served Monday through Friday, before 3 PM. The lunch menu addition seems like a surefire way to lure people to the 800 Olive Gardens locations nationwide well before happy hour starts.
But just because it's strictly a lunch dish, there's nothing stopping you from taking it home and eating it at 3 in the morning. That, too, is also the Olive Garden way."

According to a study from lawn care company Lawn Love, the Big Apple is the best city for vampires in the US, and there are plenty of reasons why. Compared to other big cities across the country, NYC has the most potential victims for hungry vamps. It also flaunts the highest number of slaughterhouses (which are ideal for a quick drink) as well as the most vampire groups.
With many bars, nightlife venues, and, most importantly, casket suppliers, NYC is an oasis for Draculas of all sorts. It also helps that the MTA runs 24/7 for easier and speedier nightly hunting commutes, and the city's not-so-sunny climate is surely beneficial for vampires, too.
It's not a surprise that freezing Chicago and rainy Seattle respectively ranked second and third best cities for vamps. At the bottom of the list, Southern cities are the least hospitable for blood drinkers, since that's where it gets really difficult to avoid the sun's hot rays. According to the study, Southern cities also have few homes with basements, and casket suppliers are not that common, especially in California.
To come up with the results, Lawn Love took into consideration the 200 biggest cities in the US, and gathered public data on a variety of factors. Number of potential victims, number of blood drives, and even cannibalism legality all fall under the ""Food and Drink"" category, while aspects such as cloud cover and share of home with basements belong in the ""Lair Safety"" net. A ""Deterrents"" category featuring number of Christian churches, number of werewolf clubs, and even garlic festivals, as well as entertainment option for vamps.
After calculating and averaging weighted scores for each city in each category, NYC came out on top with the highest average score of 55. Vampires seem to love it here, too. If you ever want to meet the community, rumor has it that they like to hang at Madame X and Death and Co. NYC, according to Yelp."

When anyone asks where my favorite place in NYC is, the answer is obvious: Governors Island.
The 172-acre island, partially made from the cast-off rocks from the Lexington Avenue Subway, is the verdant backyard that New Yorkers desperately need. It's completely car-free so cycling is a breeze, the views of the harbor, the city and the Statue of Liberty are breathtaking and its acres of open land give beleaguered city residents a chance to spread their limbs without clobbering the person next to them.
In recent years, the island has woken from its slumber as a former military site—an identity it's held since 1995 when the Coast Guard left—and has become a destination for culture with a burgeoning arts program as well as an oasis for recreation in a city where open space is extremely limited. It has become especially a summer activity for those seeking an escape from the concrete, but in 2021, The Trust for Governors Island announced that the park would be open year-round for the first time. Now, New Yorkers and tourists can enjoy the giant park any time of year.
With this major change, the island is staying open later and has way more to offer than ever before, from multiple dining options with bars to the new QC NY Spa and the Collective Retreats glamping grounds. It's becoming a New York City neighborhood in its own right.
Below, we've created and tested out a 24-hour itinerary for those who want to spend a full day at Governors Island. Note: It takes multiple visits to see everything and even then, the island has seasonal programming making each visit slightly different.
Start your day on the island by pampering yourself at this new Italian spa. QC NY is a beautiful day spa that has taken over renovated former military barracks/family housing from 1934 with relaxation rooms, themed saunas, Vichy showers, infrared beds, foot baths, hydro jets, steam baths and other amazingly lush experiences. It also has two heated pools outside with unbeatable views of the harbor and Lower Manhattan. Once you've spent time in its saunas, enjoy a hydromassage in the pool and then grab a lounger for full relaxation and a view you can only get on Governors Island. Entry to this oasis is $90 on weekdays and $116 on weekends, but it includes access to all its amenities, excluding services such as massages.
Time Out Tip: Order the Aperitivo from the spa's kitchen—your cocktail is served with a special selection of Italian classic aperitivo bites (cheese, mortadella, olives, focaccia, vegetables and more)!
With 30 accommodations, a restaurant and bar, a giant campfire, lawn games and more, Collective Governors Island offers the only way you can sleep over on the island. Check in to one of its four Outlook Shelters, 10 Summit Tents or 16 Journey+ Tents, depending on the level of luxury you crave. While it's most definitely still camping (there are bugs and weird animal noises at night), it's got all the amenities of a hotel room, including plush linens.
Time Out Tip: Bring bug spray and your own snacks and beverages, which you can store in a provided Yeti cooler.
One of the best things Collective Retreats offers at its Governors Island outpost is its arts and crafts workshops, which include flower arranging and pottery/mezcal tasting. We made our own small drinking vessels out of clay (with help from a trained staff member) as we sipped on three types of mezcal imported from Mexico. It was a delightful way to spend the afternoon as we worked up an appetite for dinner later on.
Time Out Tip: Go into this with an open mind (and a snack in your belly). The agave worms won't help hold your liquor.
Sheep are snacking on invasive plant species as part of an innovative and eco-friendly landscaping program on the island and you can find them in Hammock Grove! The island's animal residents are many—there is a bee sanctuary from the Bee Conservancy that you can visit and chickens at the Grow NYC Teaching Farm toward the eastern side of the island. As you meet these creatures, staff will happily fill you in on what they're doing and why it's important for the island and the city!
Time Out Tip: On Saturday and Sunday from noon-4pm, you can say ""hi"" to the goats and learn the ins and outs of composting on Governors Island at the Compost Learning Center at the Urban Farm.
While there are certainly other places to grab dinner on the island, if you want a truly fantastic meal, don't skip Collective Governors Island's menu. From Executive Chef Ezra Lewis, who combines his Caribbean roots with classic European techniques, and Chef de Cuisine Owen Laufersweiler, who helped launch the Michelin-starred restaurant Oxalis, the new Wood-Fired Grill menu includes foods cooked in the great outdoors on an Argentine barbecue grill, including beef shoulder with cognac, cream, and green peppercorn sauce or smoked Shogun maitake mushroom with tamari and kumquat glaze. The centerpiece is accompanied by appetizers, sides, and desserts from Chef Aura that showcase the farm-fresh flavors of local produce. The six-course spring tasting menu features rotating dishes made from seasonal and local foods and an optional wine pairing. It's all incredibly fresh and flavorful.
Time Out Tip: While you may have booked your dinner at a certain time, you don't necessarily need to keep that time. Check in with the host before taking a seat.
Walk off your dinner and head over to Soissons Landing (likely where you got off the ferry earlier in the day), where you can grab a drink at Taco Vista, Island Oyster or the newly arrived Gitano Island. Once you've got a beverage in hand, prepare yourself for one helluva sunset. Now through October 31, the landing's bars and restaurants will be open late every night of the week so you can take full advantage of the offerings there.
Time Out Tip: Gitano Island, which opened earlier this month, is decorated with 30-feet-tall coconut palm trees, has a mezcal bar, two dining patios and a state-of-the-art DJ tent all centered around a serene water feature. It's a vibe.
Every night until 10pm, Collective Governors Island offers free s'mores that you can roast over its campfires. Grab your ingredients and chill with your friends or significant other as you chat about your day, the island, the city and whatever else. Here, you'll meet fellow campers and be treated to a dreamy view of a sparkling Manhattan skyline. If you want to keep the party going after 10pm, you can purchase a bottle of wine at the bar or rely on the goodies in your cooler since the kitchen and bar shut down.
Time Out Tip: There is Wi-Fi you can connect to if you can't fully devote yourself to the great outdoors and want to watch some Netflix on your tablet.
In the morning when you've greeted the sun, the retreat's staff will drop off a basket of breakfast items (i.e. muffins, stonefruit, and water) on your deck. Enjoy a slow wake-up and breakfast in the Adirondack chairs.
Time Out Tip: Each accommodation has a French press coffee maker.
Once you've checked out of your tent, head over to Blazing Saddles to rent bicycles for a fun ride around the island. You don't need to worry about traffic since no cars are allowed. Take this time to check out the art installations and exhibits scattered throughout the acreage, including ""The May Room"" by Shantell Martin (pictured below) and ""The American Manifest, Moving Chains."" Don't miss what's going on in the old homes around the island—local organizations have taken up residence in a handful of them and often have public programming you can participate in, especially on the weekends.
Time Out Tip: Check out the Trust's website to see what events are on for the time you're there. From markets and festivals to workshops and performances, there's always something going on.
Before you leave the island, grab some tasty tacos and guac from Taco Vista at Soisson's Landing. The casual eatery offers a fun environment and tasty bites right on the water.
Time Out Tip: There's a new lemonade stand this summer, where you can order some boozy lemonade from Fishers Island Lemonade. Flavors include traditional spiked lemonade, Pink Flamingo, Spiked Tea and Fishers Island Lemonade Fizz.
Say ""goodbye"" to the coolest island in NYC, aside from Manhattan that is. Ferries typically leave every half hour and only take 4 minutes to cross back to Manhattan. There's another ferry that goes to Brooklyn as well. Make sure to check the ferry schedule before you plan to head out.
Time Out tip: You won't need to get another ticket to get off the island. Just wait in line and board."
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/this-map-shows-you-how-to-properly-avoid-santacon-shenanigans-this-year-120822,Timeout,"Or, perhaps, how to join the various Santas?
Whether you look forward to it each year or would rather avoid the city when it happens, the annual SantaCon event has good intentions. After all, in the last decade alone, organizers have raised over $900,000 for charitable causes—that's a lot!
Every $15 ticket sold directly benefits Santa's charity drive and all proceeds are usually split between the various charities selected each year (find them all here) and local neighborhood ones.
However, as important and, let's be honest, culture-defining, as the annual shenanigans are, we can't argue with New Yorkers who simply can't stand the chaos caused by hundreds of Santa Clauses rushing around bars, drinking beer and celebrating the holidays, which is why we expect many to stay cooped up inside when this year's SantaCon kicks off this Saturday morning at 10am.
To help you avoid the crowds, you'll want to check out this map of the route that all dressed-up folks will follow this weekend.
Things will kick off in the morning on Broadway and 40th Street, with a giant dance party that will pump everyone before heading to participating bars and clubs, including John Sullivan's at 210 West 35th Street, Pando39 by Sixth Avenue and Stags Head at 252 East 51st Street.
Insomnia Cookies locations will also be participating, offering Santas a bunch of pretty awesome deals designed to soak up all that alcohol. They'll need it.
And if you just so happen not to be a hater, more power to you. You're going to want to use this map to join in on the fun, then! Happy SantaCon!"
https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/popeyes-wild-berry-beignets,Thrillist,"It just feels wrong to not accompany a Popeyes Chicken Sandwich with something sweet—be it those turnover-style fried pies or a classic Beignet. The Southern-style fast food joint has toyed with iterations of its deep-fried, powdered sugar-doused pastries before, and now Popeyes is putting an all-new twist on its fan-favorite Beignets.
According to The Fast Food Post, the chain is testing Wild Berry Beignets at locations across California, New York, and Illinois. Much like Popeyes' original Beignets, the New Orleans delicacy features a golden brown fried pastry sprinkled with powdered sugar. This time, they're also stuffed with berry filling.
The Wild Berry Beignets come in 3-, 6-, and 12-piece orders for $1.99, $3.99, and $7.49, the outlet reports. A word to the wise though: be careful. Eating beignets isn't exactly a mess-free experience. Take it from Popeyes.
""Being a brand from New Orleans, Popeyes knows a thing or two about beignets, and one thing’s for certain—they can be messy!""  the company said in a statement. ""One bite and powdered sugar is everywhere.""
It isn't the first time Popeyes has played with its Beignets recipe. Back in 2020, the chain unleashed a chocolate-stuffed version.
""As a brand from New Orleans we are always looking to bring new dishes and desserts from our hometown to the menu,"" a spokesperson for Popeyes told Thrillist at the time of the launch."
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/tolls-between-nyc-and-new-jersey-have-just-increased-011123,Timeout,"Another day, another toll hike—this one affecting commuters in New York and New Jersey.
Citing inflation as the main culprit, the Port Authority approved fair increases at select crossings last month and the changes just went into effect this past weekend.
Overall, drivers will be charged an extra dollar per trip when taking the Outerbridge Crossing, the Bayonne Bridge, the Goethals Bridges and the George Washington Bridge in-between the two states.
Specifically, cars traveling through the passages during peak hours (weekdays: 6-10am and 4-8pm, weekends: 11am-9pm) will have to pay a toll of $14.75 via E-ZPass. Off-peak fare has now reached $12.75 when using E-ZPass. A flat fare of $17 will be applied to all cars who do not use the electronic toll collection system (that's a $1 increase as well).
The news is a stark reminder that the price of just about everything went up. This past summer, for example, our bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches got much more expensive while taxi fares increased for the first time in a decade. And who can forget about the death of the $1 slice?
Silver lining: we can't imagine why you'd have to travel to New Jersey more than, say, once a year, so this particular transportation development might not affect your directly.
As for New Jerseyans who head into Manhattan regularly: well, that's the price you have to pay to visit your great neighboring state."

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/ring-made-from-hidden-valley-ranch-sold,Thrillist,"It's been argued that you can put ranch dressing on anything. And while the verdict is still out on how ranch pairs with certain foods, there's an expensive new piece of evidence in favor of its surprisingly broad utility. Hidden Valley Ranch created a first-of-its-kind diamond made of ranch, which just sold on Ebay for over $12,000.
The round, brilliant-cut diamond was created by a professional diamond maker in a lab by heating Hidden Valley Ranch seasoning to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit and then crushing the leftover charred dressing beneath 400 tons of pressure. The diamond took five months in total to create. After the two carat rock was formed and polished to perfection, the diamond was set in a 14K white gold band with ""HVR LVR"" (""Hidden Valley Ranch Lover"") engraved on the inside.
According to the Hidden Valley's Marketing Director, Deb Crandall, the inspiration behind the Hidden Valley Ranch ring was love. ""Last year, when one of our custom Valentine's Day bottles was used in a marriage proposal, we were inspired,"" she said, adding that the proposal made her wonder ""How can we make this act of love even more memorable?"" And thus, the ranch ring was born.
Anyone interested in the ring could place their bids via Ebay up until March 17. Although we can't be sure the winner will be using the ring for a proposal, Hidden Valley wanted to make sure they received it by March 20, which is National Proposal Day. After 79 bids and a starting offer of $310, the ring eventually sold for $12,550.
All proceeds from the unusual diamond ring went toward the charity Feeding America."
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/these-are-the-worst-subway-stations-according-to-new-yorkers-052521,Timeout,"See which stations are driving New Yorkers crazy.
New Yorkers agree that taking the subway is both frustrating and necessary. Yes, we depend on it to get to work and to our favorite spots in NYC, but the dirt and grime, the weird characters, the maze of stairs and the intermittent flooding is almost too much to bear.
One thing we do like, however, is complaining about the subway, so when New York Times Metro reporter Michael Gold asked people on Twitter what their least favorite station is, there was no hesitation to share.
Here are some of the worst subway stations, according to New Yorkers.
The platform pushes, slashing, the screeching, the scary moving platform and the summer heat on the 4/5/6 platform make Union Square unbearable for many.
The ""sadistic"" long walk between the connected lines, the crowding at rush hour, the heat, the 45-degree angled ramp, and the depressing poem that tells you to turn around, give up and go home is enough to drive commuters crazy.
From the sewer stench on 59th Street's 4/5 platform is the ""devil's armpit,"" its 6 platform is full of rude people who don't move to let people out and its RWN platform gets overcrowded too often. The 63rd Street at Lexington takes way too many elevators to get to ground level.
Times Sq just as a general matter. The 4/5 platform at 59th is basically the devil's armpit. And the lower platform of the 63rd St./3rd-Lex station in Manhattan because it requires approximately 17 escalators to get to street level.
It's well-known that this station is one of the hottest with temperatures reaching over 100 degrees on a regular basis. One Tweet said it is ""hotter than the actual core of the earth in August,"" but what else makes it one of the worst stations? It's super deep so you have to take never-ending ramps or escalators and you're not even at ground level yet.
Not the worst in and of itself, but my therapist's office is off the Herald Sq stop and I always feel like I need an extra session just from the walk from the train to her office. Shit's too much.
First, Canal Street's southbound Q platform ""smells like horse died there the year the Dodgers left Brooklyn,' according to Amanda Barrett, and ""the platform toward the front it's only big enough for one pre-pandemic weight person."" The station as a whole is maze-like so transfers are pretty terrible.
The fact that the G tracks don't connect to Manhattan — it's confusing AF. It also has ""foreboding unused outer platforms and long walks through empty tunnels.""
I can go on, but Hoyt-Schmerhorn is the worst switching from the AC to the G Is a nightmare. If you’re going uptown/to Manhattan on the AC you need to switch platforms to get on the G (even though you’re going north, just on the BK side). Very counter intuitive.
Also steamy during the summer, 168th on the 1 or A platforms is like ""a chicken gathering waiting to be cooked in data hot ass station,"" according to @icedoutflyaway1. It's also ""elevator dependent,"" meaning that if the ""slow hot death box"" of an elevator breaks, it's unclear how to get out, riders say.
Can't believe I had to scroll this far before someone mentioned the 168th St 1/2/3 station. The whole station but especially the elevators are straight out of a horror movie.
""Terrifying elevators"" and ""dungeon vibes"" are found at this stop. It's another one with only elevators used to exit and they always break down, according to straphangers. It's too small for the population that lives near the stop, which services the 1 train."
https://www.eater.com/pop-culture/2019/2/22/18236670/kfc-robocop-colonel-sanders,Eater,"KFC’s venerable founder and chameleon-like mascot Colonel Sanders has once again morphed into a new form — RoboCop. A new ad campaign features the dystopian zombie cyborg police officer, voiced by original 1980s RoboCop actor Peter Weller, defending the fried chicken chain’s secret blend of 11 herbs and spices in a nuclear bunker in Stockholm, Sweden.
In one spot, Colonel RoboCop offers a family one of KFC’s $20 Fill Ups meals and demands that they comply. In another, he attends a dinner party and deflects questions about the recipe with an “If I told you, then I’d have to kill you.” The awkward silence is broken by a mechanical laugh. In the final spot, RoboCop scans the city streets for all-white meat $5 Full Ups instead of criminals.
As usual, the KFC campaign is incredibly weird — it stars a chrome-plated cyborg donning the white-haired wig of the Colonel to urge people to eat fried chicken — and uncannily aware of the ways in which it’s manipulating nostalgia and a sense of satisfaction that remix culture often traffics in, of being in on the reference. But it’s all the weirder given that the original movie, a Christ allegory and one of the most blood-soaked movies of the 1980s, heavily satirized Reagan-era consumerism and brand tyranny in the form of OCP; KFC is part of Yum brands, which also owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, and was once part of PepsiCo, one of the largest food corporations in the world.
This is the latest in a long string of celebrities taking on the Colonel’s persona, including Reba McEntire, Jim Gaffigan, Rob Lowe, Billy Zane, Ray Liotta, and Norm Macdonald."
https://www.timeout.com/news/revealed-the-worlds-best-airlines-in-2022-092622,Timeout,"All things considered, 2022 has been a pretty shoddy year for airlines and airports. Staff shortages have caused thousands of cancelled and delayed flights, enormous queues and mini mountains of lost luggage. And the chaos isn’t over yet: some airports and airlines predict that the disruption could last all the way until summer 2023.
Given all the bad stuff blighting the aviation industry at the mo, we wouldn’t blame you for wanting to know which airlines are actually not having a bad time. In that regard, airline reviews and ratings site Skytrax held its annual awards in London last Friday (23 September), taking into account over 14 million customer surveys to reveal the world’s best airlines.
Top of this year’s Skytrax ranking came Qatar Airways, which boasted comfortable seats, high-quality food, up-to-date in-flight entertainment and a modern fleet. Qatar Airways is no stranger to taking the top spot in rankings of the world’s best airlines: back in July, it also topped a similar list by AirlineRatings.com.
Second in Skytrax’s list was Singapore Airlines, thanks to its gourmet dining and state-of-the-art entertainment systems, while third came Emirates due to its great customer service and clean, comfy planes.
There’s also much more to Skytrax’s annual awards than just a list of the top airlines. The company also releases separate rankings for dining, comfort, service, cleanliness and more. Irish budget airline Ryanair also had a surprise triumph – thanks to its reliability this summer, it was crowned Europe’s best low-cost airline.

https://www.timeout.com/new-orleans/hotels/where-to-stay-in-new-orleans,Timeout,"Not sure where to stay in the Big Easy? Fret not; our guide to the best places to stay in New Orleans will put you on the right path to an unforgettable getaway. NOLA is much more than the French Quarter, but don’t take that as a dismissal of its most famous neighborhood; love cafes, you’ll be swooning there.
With a location that positively hugs the Mississippi River, New Orleans is a jumble of fascinating neighborhoods that offer everything from family-run restaurants to debauchery and excess in spades. Wherever you choose to stay in New Orleans, you are in for a great time, but a little knowledge goes a long way.
The French Quarter is the city’s oldest and best-known neighborhood. Most visitors make a beeline to Bourbon Street, and many first-timers think the Quarter is nothing but a party. But there’s a lot more to do here - gorgeous architecture, a ton of history, fabulous antiques, local boutiques, great food, music, and views of the Mississippi. It’s family-friendly, with the Aquarium of the Americas, the Cabildo Museum, carriage rides, street performers, and more fun for kids. Stay here if you want to be in the middle of it all, with easy access to other neighborhoods.
While the Quarter is home to newer, award-winning restaurants, dining at one of New Orleans’ historic fine dining institutions is a must. Galatoire’s offers a glimpse into the city’s unique dining culture; most of the waiters, dressed in tuxedos, are local and have worked at the restaurant for decades, and many high-society locals are longtime regulars. The bright walls, black-and-white tile, and white tablecloths serve a refined but celebratory atmosphere. Dine on shrimp rémoulade, trout almondine, and other New Orleans classics for a memorable experience.
Located in the century-old Creole restaurant Arnaud’s, the French 75 bar offers a step back in time. The dark, intimate space is adorned with monkey lamps and other original vintage decor. Order a classic cocktail like an Old Fashioned or a sidecar, or ask the expert bartenders for an inventive concoction. Either way, you’ll be impressed. Try the soufflé potatoes, an Arnaud’s specialty, then check out the intriguing Mardi Gras museum upstairs.
Running parallel to Bourbon Street, one block over is one of the Quarter’s most elegant routes. From Canal to Esplanade, you’ll find a beautiful stretch of art galleries, antique shops, fine jewelry, street performers, and picturesque buildings adorned with intricate ironwork. For a unique experience, check out M.S. Rau Antiques. The 25,000-square-foot gallery features an incredible collection of high-end antiques, art, and sculpture. Ask to see the “secret room”, and you’ll be amazed at the rare, museum-quality artifacts on display.
Family-owned and operated since 1886, the Monteleone is one of the most recognized hotels in the city. Its opulent rooms were favored by writers such as Anne Rice, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, and William Faulkner. The star of the hotel is the Carousel Bar. Locals and tourists frequent this revolving bar for classic cocktails and musical entertainment. It’s a must-do on any visitor’s list, and as a guest, you can imbibe to your heart’s content and stroll right onto your room. You can also enjoy a meal at Criollo, with its ingredient-driven menu presenting the fusion of flavors that make up Louisiana cuisine.
Get beignets and cafe au lait at Cafe du Monde. Enjoy an order on the covered outdoor area and watch the crowds go by on Decatur, or take it to go and sit on the edge of the Mississippi. Your visit to the Quarter isn’t complete unless you’re covered in powdered sugar at some point.
Downriver from the French Quarter, across Esplanade Avenue, are two of the trendiest neighborhoods in the city, frequently referred to as one continuous neighborhood. The young and the hip are drawn to this area, attracting an ever-increasing in-the-know crowd. Hotel chains have yet to invade, but there are several bed and breakfasts and a couple of smaller inns to consider. The furthest reaches of Bywater are best accessed with a cab or rideshare, but the energetic can safely walk through the area during daylight. You’ll find colorful Creole cottages and historic homes containing small cafes and shops, a few art galleries and hip record stores, and the riverfront Crescent Park. Restaurants are local and casual, with a smattering of vegan-friendly spots along St. Claude Avenue. Bars run the gamut from the classy Three Muses to the divey Hi-Ho Lounge. The epicenter is Frenchmen Street; you’ll find live music venues where you can hear anything from jazz or blues to reggae and rock or even a brass band performing on a corner. It’s still crowded but a more unique alternative to the Quarter.
Perched above the bustling Frenchmen Street, up a narrow flight of stairs from the Apple Barrel bar, is this quaint, cash-only restaurant serving Creole Italian—a local specialty combining Italian and local French influences. Enjoy huge portions of seafood and pasta as you check out the quirky, colorful decor. Be prepared for a wait, and bring cash.
While it’s no longer a locals’ secret, Bacchanal retains its unique local charm and funky hideaway feel. At the far end of the Bywater, you’ll find this wine shop/hangout with a cozy “treehouse” bar and lush back patio. Pick a bottle and a cheese plate or one of several gourmet small plate offerings and listen to a live band. It’s like a party at your friend’s house every night of the week.
Experience joy, art, and music at this interactive installation in the Marigny. The 5,500 square-foot warehouse space has been converted into a selfie haven with bright, colorful rooms designed by local artists, celebrating local art, music, and culture. Jump into a pot with a giant crawfish, snap a pic with an oversized bust of local musicians, and become part of the art in virtual reality booths. It’s sensory overload, New Orleans style.
Hotel Peter & Paul sits in a building that used to be a Catholic church and school but has since been reimagined into one of NOLA’s most stunning places to stay. If the gingham-clad rooms don’t win you over, with their antique furniture and snazzily-tiled bathrooms, perhaps The Elysian Bar will: this is one of the hottest places to drink in the city.
Support live, local music on Frenchmen. Whether it’s a brass band at d.b.a, reggae at Cafe Negril, or trad jazz at Snug Harbor (to name just a few), experience the music up close. You can also stop in Louisiana Music Factory to take home some tunes from your favorite local artists.
The CBD, just across Canal Street from the French Quarter, contains the bulk of New Orleans office buildings and includes the Warehouse District and the so-called South Market District. Typically the go-to area for travelers conducting business in the city, it has blossomed into a hip hub for food, drink, and culture. The Warehouse District, which began its transformation in the late '80s, is now a full-on arts district with renowned art galleries and museums. The CBD also includes the Orpheum and Saenger Theaters and the Superdome - home of the New Orleans Saints. You’ll find a wealth of places geared towards office workers for a quick, inexpensive bite, along with some of the city’s most talked-about restaurants, including Cochon, Peche, and Emeril’s. Younger travelers will be drawn to cool hotels with rooftop bars like the Ace, Moxy, and Troubadour, as well as renowned landmark hotels like The Roosevelt, Windsor Court, and Le Pavillon. For a more modern vibe and trendier offerings, the CBD is a good choice for its walkability and proximity to the French Quarter.
A smaller spinoff of chefs Donald Link and Stephen Stryjewski’s famed Cochon, Butcher has now come into its own as a top destination for a Cajun-influenced, meat-centric meal. Grab a deli sandwich at the counter or take home house-made meats, sausages, terrines, pickles, sauces, and jams. Don't miss out on taking some Andouille and Tasso home with you.
This elegant bar within the landmark Roosevelt Hotel was a favorite of Huey Long’s. Sidle up to the long wood bar, order a sazerac or a Ramos gin fizz, and admire the famous Paul Ninas murals. A New Orleans icon, the Sazerac Bar has long been one of the city’s most popular pre- or post-meal gathering spots for friends, families, and business dealings.
“Gallery Row” on Julia Street in the Warehouse District is a series of more than a dozen art galleries occupying former storefronts. The architecture creates a unique setting for browsing classic and cutting-edge art. On the first Saturday of every month, galleries host coordinated openings with a festive atmosphere. White Linen Night - held on the first Saturday in August - is the premier event, when hundreds of people come out in white linen to enjoy art, food, and music.
The Virgin Hotel brings even more hip cred to the CBD, offering relaxing digs within walking distance of the Quarter. Rooms are chic and comfortable, and there is plenty to explore around the hotel. Hang at the rooftop Pool Club and enjoy a cocktail and views of the city, grab a coffee in the Funny Library, or have dinner at Commons Club. The Virgin is pet friendly too.
Visit the National WWII Museum, a world-class complex with award-winning exhibits showcasing the stories of those who served in WWII and on the homefront. Highlights include a theater with WWII-era musical performances, a restaurant, and a fantastic gift shop with 1940s-inspired gifts and clothing.
This area of the city—encompassing several smaller, residential neighborhoods upriver from the French Quarter - includes the St. Charles Avenue streetcar, grand historic mansions, Tulane and Loyola Universities, the beautiful Audubon Park and Zoo, and many beloved local institutions. It’s away from the hubbub of the French Quarter, offering the culture without the craziness, but easily accessible by various modes of transportation. During Mardi Gras, it is a great place to be, as the parades roll down St. Charles in an exceptionally family-friendly environment. You’ll find neighborhood cafes, po-boy shops, long-running family restaurants, and several popular spots for sno-balls, New Orleans’ favorite summertime treat. You can enjoy pleasant walks, grand oak trees, and unique shopping. As you move further to Uptown, passing scores of grand Garden District mansions (which you can learn about by taking a guided walking tour), you’ll find a mix of high-end restaurants (Commander’s Palace) and colorful neighborhood dives (Parasol’s).
This century-plus Victorian cottage tucked away in the Riverbend houses some of the best modern Creole fare in the city. Chef Frank Brigtsen straightforwardly updates classic dishes with delicious results. Perfect after enjoying a stroll through the surrounding neighborhood, Brigtsen's is a smart option for sampling New Orleans cooking in an intimate, friendly setting.
Head to the outskirts of the Irish Channel on Tchoupitoulas Street to sample a wide selection of innovative, locally-influenced craft beers. Take a tour, then hang out in the convivial taproom for pints of standards like Hopitoulas and Irish Channel Stout or seasonal taproom-only flavors like hibiscus ginger.
Tip’s is a destination for music lovers, but even the disinterested will get swept up in the vibe. This funky space has been a landmark since 1977 for live music and weekly Cajun dancing sessions. The standing-room-only space is perfect for seeing a local band while soaking up some musical history. The associated Tipitina’s Foundation supports local musicians and maintains an excellent Walk of Fame on the sidewalk.
This Victorian-era mansion on St. Charles Avenue was lovingly renovated by the team behind popular spots Sylvain and Barrel Proof. With only 14 guest rooms, you will feel right at home in rooms featuring soaking tubs and local art. Relax on the front porch and watch the streetcars go by, or dine at the on-site restaurant, which features a contemporary take on New Orleans classics.
Head to Magazine Street—six miles of unique local shops, art galleries, neighborhood bars, popular restaurants, and colorful architecture.
For a real neighborhood adventure away from—but accessible to—the French Quarter, consider Mid-City. Midway between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, it offers easy access to both destinations via streetcar or taxi/rideshare. For the overachievers, the Lafitte Greenway, a 2.6-mile paved trail, is a bikeable option to the Quarter. Mid-City is a strong, diverse, local community home to the famous annual Jazz and Heritage Festival. You’ll find an artsy crowd and colorful houses in the Bayou St. John area and historic landmarks along Bayou Road. There is a thriving commercial corridor along Carrollton Avenue, and several classic bars, restaurants, breweries, and sno-ball stands everywhere. Many Mid-City families have been based in the area for generations. If you’re a repeat visitor and want a more local experience, Mid-City is a good choice.
This family-owned, casual neighborhood joint is a top choice for classic, overstuffed po-boys. It has grown in popularity, but the friendly staff still takes care of the locals while welcoming tourists. Shrimp are fried to perfection, roast beef is sufficiently messy, and the Barq's (and beer) is served icy cold. For a non-traditional po-boy option, try the smoked alligator sausage.
This Irish pub with local flavor is one of the top neighborhood bars in the city. Lively and totally unpretentious, you’ll feel like a regular as soon as you order your first beer. It is a lively gathering spot for Saints and soccer games, and their weekly pub quiz night is particularly raucous. The pop-up kitchen in the back serves decent pub grub too.
City Park is a beautifully-landscaped, 1,300-acre green space filled with moss-drenched oaks, peaceful walking paths, and native birds. Within the park are the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Botanical Gardens, and golf, both mini- and regular. The Big Lake offers boating and other activities, while Storyland and the Carousel Gardens Amusement Park offer fun for kids.
This charming B&B on Canal Street offers easy access to the streetcar. The elegant decor is original to the home, and the homemade breakfasts are filling. With comfortable parlors and a garden terrace, it is a quiet, homey place to unwind after exploring the city.
Head to Chickie Wah Wah for live music from an intimate stage. You can see jazz, funk, roots rock and select touring acts at this small club. There's always a great vibe whoever takes to the stage."

But now, a piece of my midwestern soul has died right along with DQ's Union Square outpost.
The dipped cone maker has permanently closed its only Manhattan location following a six-year stint near Union Square, Time Out confirmed with company reps earlier this week. The two-story, 2,500sqft restaurant, which was reportedly boarded up in May, will not reopen despite the buzz surrounding its 2014 debut.
But for those of you who require that perfect soft serve blend for survival (me), I've got good news: you can still get that blizzard fix. The Illinois-born ice cream joint has three remaining locations in NYC: two on Staten Island and one in the Bronx.
This isn't the only landmark loss we've seen in New York City as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. After 17 Big Mac-slinging years, McDonald's 42nd Street flagship shuttered, as well.
""McDonald’s reviews its restaurant portfolio on a regular basis to make the best decisions for our business moving forward,” the company said in a statement shared with Thrillist and other media outlets. ""The closing of the 42nd [Street] Times Square restaurant, which was planned before the pandemic, was a difficult decision, and allows us to focus on serving customers a few blocks away at the new flagship McDonald’s on 45th and Broadway and in the neighboring communities."""

The restaurant prides itself on its ""terrible service,"" and the name says it all. Get ready to be served by a bunch of Karens, who are set to be as ungrateful as the popular jokes and memes portray them to be.
The food—luckily—will be much better. Burgers and hot dogs are on the menu, and guests can expect to catch a few funny names when deciding what to eat. The ""I Want to See the Manager"" Karen burger will delight you with two Wagyu patties, Swiss cheese, bacon, lettuce, pickles, and BBQ-mustard sauce, while the Karen's Got Real Beef features overnight slow cooked smokey BBQ beef brisket, bacon, coleslaw, caramelized onion, and honey glazed BBQ sauce.
You can also choose from a variety of tasty sides to accompany your main dish. From mozzarellas sticks and onion rings to halloumi fries and loaded cheesy beef brisket, there's something for everyone. Delicious desserts are also on the menu, and beer and wine are available as well.Karen'ser in NYC is opening on March 1, and it will welcome hungry diners throughout the end of the year.

Gordon Ramsay's famous restaurant brand Fish & Chips is coming to the Big Apple for the first time, and it will plant its roots in the heart of Times Square. Delicious fish & chips will be served, featuring a modern take on the UK favorite.
The new fast-casual restaurant will be located at 1500 Broadway, and Ramsay himself is thrilled to bring such an addition to the NYC food scene.
""Fish & chips was a staple for me growing up in the UK, and I can't wait to bring it to New York City,"" the chef said in a statement. ""I love the vibrance, the energy of Times Square and the convergence of locals and visitors from around the world. There's just no place like it!""
Guests will be able to order from a long list of tasty items. Besides fish & chips—the star of the menu made with sustainable true cod—the restaurant will offer a variety of fried seafood, such as fried shrimp and lobster, as well as fried chicken for turf fans. A specialty sandwich—dubbed ""Fishwich""—will also be served, and it will feature crispy fried cod in naan bread.
Those looking for a tasty snack to munch on can order a plate of fries from the ""Just Chips"" menu, which features a list of ""dirty"" fries. They come with a combination of toppings, like jalapeño, chorizo, cotija cheese, red onion, chives, and parsley or truffle, and more.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/old-catskill-game-farm-for-sale-upstate-new-york,Thrillist,"If you were really inspired by the 2011 Matt Damon film We Bought a Zoo, we have some good news for you.
The Catskill Game Farm, a 193-acre former petting zoo and animal breeding facility, is up for sale. Located in Catskill, New York, the property is about two-and-a-half hours north of New York City by car. It began as a family-owned petting zoo in the 1930s—becoming America's first privately owned zoo—and operated until 2006. At its height, the property was home to over 2,000 animals, including the viral phenomenon April the giraffe.
In 2012, a couple purchased the former zoo and began to reimagine it as a resort property they renamed The Old Game Farm. They set up glamping sites (which are still available to book via Tentrr) and renovated the former giraffe barn into a boutique hotel called the Long Neck Inn. They couple sold to a group of investors in late 2020, who planned to bring animals back to the property and add attractions like mountain biking and archery.
Now, the former zoo is for sale once again via Corcoran Country Living. The listing emphasizes residential development opportunities on the massive property, with an asking price of $3.6 million. Reached for comment by Thrillist, Corcoran agent Jeanne Rakowski said she envisions the property will likely appeal most to developers.
""We have camp inquiries, glamping inquiries, adventurous type settings, but we think it's gonna lean towards a residential development,"" she said, adding that the property's size, location, and zoning would likely be appealing. ""It's nostalgic. It's smack in the center of Kingston, Saugerties, Woodstock, Catskill. It's right off the Thruway. It's zoned well... Properties like this are few and far between."""

Now, the burger slinger is reigniting its partnership with the brand, but this time, bringing its indulgent Black Truffle Sauce nationwide.
October 15 through January 10, Shake Shack's Truffle Menu is hitting the masses, made with Regalis Foods' USDA Organic Black Truffle Arbequina Oil, which happens to be the only truly natural truffle product on the market.
""For over 15 years, I've been proud to bring elusive and extraordinary ingredients to fine-dining restaurants and adventurous home kitchens,"" Regalis Foods Founder Ian Purkayastha said in a statement to Thrillist. ""But all the while, I've longed to share my enthusiasm and expertise to far wider audiences, and Shake Shack has proven to be the perfect partner for bringing this dream to fruition.""
""I think what makes us unique is we're a fine casual restaurant but we're born out of a fine dining restaurant group, and when I think about what bridges those worlds together, I think of this burger because it has that black truffle which a lot of people might associate a white table cloth, fine dining restaurant,"" Shake Shack Culinary Director Mark Rosati told Thrillist.
If the menu looks smaller than before, that's because it is. The NYC and LA-exclusive truffle menu featured two additional items, a Black Truffle' Shroom Burger, with a crispy portobello mushroom, Muenster and Cheddar cheese, and Black truffle sauce, and the Black Truffle Shack Stack, which featured a Roth Gruyere cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger with black truffle sauce. In their place, however, Shake Shack added those Garlic Parmesan Fries with truffle sauce right on the side.
""The sauce is so good, naturally, we were testing it and dipping our fries in it. It's better than using a spoon. Then we decided to innovate around that,"" Rosati said before adding. ""We wanted to echo the ingredients in the sauce a little further. We made a garlic parmesan seasoning, we tossed the fries in that beforehand, and then served the sauce on the side. We just wanted to bring that flavor out more for the fries, because the fries are just a delicious, crispy blank canvas that can hold all of these flavors."""
https://www.thrillist.com/eat/new-york/taco-tuesday-pizza-tony-boloneys-hoboken-nj,Thrillist,"At Tony Boloney’s in Hoboken, NJ, Taco Tuesday has evolved into the far-less-fun-to-say Taco Pizza Tuesday. The ridiculously named restaurant on the other side of the Hudson River was well-known for its Atlantic City-style pizzas and subs before owner Mike Hauke decided on a whim to appease a group of stoned kids with the ultimate munchies snack: tacos on top of pizza.
“These kids came in high as hell... stoned out of their minds,” Hauke recalls. “They were like, ‘Yo, let me get some tacos.’” Other customers started asking what it was, and suddenly there was a line out the door for the 30lb Taco Pizza every Tuesday.
The massive pizza (which costs $80 per pie or $10 per slice) begins with house-made queso Oaxaca, carne asada, chipotle asada, and a solid heaping of cheese on top of pizza dough. Once the pizza is cooked, a myriad of taco varieties are piled on the outer rim of the pizza. To finish it all off, guacamole and sour cream are added to the center of the pie for easy dipping access.
Since introducing the pie, the kitchen has started going through about 100 individual slices (with three tacos on each slice) every Tuesday. And while it’s generally 20-somethings from the area who frequent Tony Boloney’s, a lot of families with young kids stop by for a sub or a sampling from a menu dedicated to mozzarella sticks. Hauke says YouTube stars from Manhattan have made the pilgrimage to taste the famed Taco Pizza, as well as local musicians and NFL players who live in Hoboken.

We have to be completely honest with you: we're still not entirely sure what an NFT even is. That being said, we're here to report that a new vending machine that lets New Yorkers buy NFTs with a credit card has just set up shop at 29 John Street, in the Financial District, and it seems to be the very first of its kind in the city.
According to an official press release, the destination—open 24 hours a day—is actually the first NFT vending machine in the world but a mere Google search proves that not to be the case. That being said, NFTs are still a rather new phenomenon so the thought of having the dispensary in our own town is pretty cool anyway.
The machine, which comes courtesy of new NFT and digital collecting platform Neon, accepts American credit and debit cards. Once you slide your card in and make a selection, you'll receive a box with a unique code inside of it for your chosen NFT, which you'll then be able to redeem on Neon's platform.
""Our goal is to support artists and creators by letting them sell digital art to everyone, and to help anyone who wants to become a collector,"" said Jordan Birnholtz, Chief Marketing Officer and co-founder of Neon, in an official statement. ""Giving people the choice to use vending machines and an easy online platform that decouples cryptocurrency from NFT participation means we can engage the widest possible audience. NFT buying and selling doesn’t need to be a mystery.""
Unfortunately, it's all still a mystery to us but we vow to do our best to try and fully comprehend this new form of... art? Currency? Barter?

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/jack-in-the-box-new-really-big-chicken-sandwich,Thrillist,"If you've spent any time on the internet lately, you've probably seen something about chicken sandwiches; namely, the meme-filled debate over whether Popeyes' first-ever sandwich is better than Chick-fil-A's original. There have been new chicken sandwich rankings, Twitter feuds, and shortage reports. And now, the grease-fueled mania has seemingly spawned some new chicken sandwich interpretations, like aptly-named Really Big Chicken Sandwich at Jack in the Box.
Have you ever been devouring a chicken sandwich and midway through you've thought, ""I could really use an extra chicken patty in this?"" Yes? How about two extra patties -- or three? Jack in the Box's new Really Big Chicken Sandwich lets you customize how much poultry you'd like between your buns, with up to four patties on one bun. Four.
The chicken sandwich comes topped with an onion-mayonnaise sauce, lettuce, tomato, and something called ""Swiss-style"" cheese, which we're guessing is part Swiss and part melty science stuff that's used to make American cheese. The more patties you add to your sandwich, the more cheese you get (just look at the photo above).
Made with 100% white meat chicken, the Really Big Chicken Sandwich comes in a double for $3.99 a combo, a triple for $4.99 a combo, or a quad for $5.99, according to a spokesperson for the chain. Six bucks for a four-patty chicken sandwich with a drink and fries (get curly fries if you know what's good for you) is not a bad deal. Is completely ridiculous, though? Probably.
Like all great fast food inventions, the Really Big Chicken Sandwich is only around for a little while, starting on September 2.
Jack in the Box may not be great at naming new menu items, but they are great and stuffing chicken in sandwiches.

""When we made the decision to add it to our store, we sought to bring customers the most authentic coffee experience and Brooklyn Roasting Company fit that vision perfectly.

The new coffee counter offers limited seating, with beverages in mugs to linger over, as well as to-go coffees for those who want something to sip while browsing the stacks. The menu includes a seasonal blend of hot coffee ($3- $4), plus espresso drinks, chai and matcha. For summer, iced blueberry or iced lemon espresso spritzers are also offered.

Believe it or not, there has never been a Krispy Kreme on Staten Island—but things are about to change.
The iconic coffee and doughnut chain has announced the opening of its first location within the borough at 2643 Richmond Avenue by the Staten Island Mall. The shop, officially opening on September 20, will also be the only one in New York state boasting a drive-through and it will up the number of total chain stores across all boroughs to 14.
In case you were wondering: the venue will, indeed, also boast the brand's iconic Hot Light, which signals when fresh doughnuts are being rolled off the assembly line.
To celebrate the grand opening, all Staten Island patrons will receive a free original glazed doughnut any time the Hot Light is on (no purchase necessary) from opening day through September 27. What's more, 30 lucky customers will receive a special golden ticket that will afford them an entire year's worth of free doughnuts. You read that right.

Although New York is certainly home to some extraordinary “artisanal” mom-and-pop shops that deliver delicious sweets in a more intimate environment than stores like Dunkin’ and Krispy Kreme do, there is something to be said about the national chains, which can be virtually credited with popularizing doughnuts throughout the decades.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/best-airlines-in-the-world,Thrillist,"Flying has been generally chaotic since travel's return to pre-pandemic levels of demand, but some companies have gone above and beyond to ensure that even when delays and cancellations occur, passengers would still feel like they were taking a trip somewhere enjoyable. But depending on who you ask, which of the world's airlines are the best and which are the worst varies considerably.
This month, luggage storage company Bounce released its 2023 Airline Index, which includes a ranking of the best and worst airlines in the world. According to this analysis, based on factors like each airline's number of on-time arrivals, customer complaints, in-flight amenities, and baggage policies, Japan Airlines came in at number one, followed closely behind by Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways in the second and third spots.
The list differs from the annual Skytrax World Airline Awards, which were announced earlier this year. Each ranking claims to definitively name the world's best airlines with presumable authority. The resulting Skytrax ranking named the best 100 airlines in the world, with Singapore Airlines eeking it to the top of the list over Qatar Airways and ANA All Nippon Airways. Only one American airline made the top 20 in Skytrax ranking, with Delta Air Lines coming in at the 20th spot. Japan Airlines, Bounce's top airline, came in fifth here.
The Skytrax and Bounce rankings also differ considerably from the latest ranking released by AirlineRatings.com, which named Air New Zealand the best airline in 2023. Qatar Airways still came second on this list, but Japan Airlines was all the way down in the nineteenth spot. Etihad Airways took third in this ranking.
One thing that all three airline rankings have in common is that no American airlines made it to the top 10. At least we have some general consensus there.
""We wanted to recreate our annual Airline Index for 2023 with the latest and most up-to-date data. 52 airlines were included in our international comparison, including the top 50 airlines by number of flights and two airlines that made the top three in our 2022 edition, while the domestic airline section includes 10 of the largest airlines in the United States,"" Bounce shared of its methodology.
Domestic airlines weren't completely forgotten. Bounce also named the five best and worst domestic airlines in a separate ranking. Here, Delta, Southwest, and Hawaiian Airlines took top spots. On the flip side of the equation were Allegiant, Frontier, and Spirit.

https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-orleans/guides/classic-new-orleans-bars-restaurants,Theinfatuation,"New Orleans is a city known for its Creole food, bar and nightlife scene, and lengthy, dressed-up lunches with multiple rounds of martinis and turtle soup. The food here is deeply tied to the region’s history of French, West African, and Caribbean influences, and there are so many excellent places in town that it’s tough to have a bad meal. But you’re here because you want the best.
This guide will help you find overstuffed po’boys and life-altering étouffée. Those famous beignets? Yeah, we’ve got thoughts about them, too. Below are the most essential classic restaurants that are just as vital to any trip to New Orleans as touring a cemetery or ending the night with an inexplicable amount of beads.
Been there, done that? Here's our guide to the top spots in New Orleans.
Commander’s Palace opened in the 1890s and is the quintessential New Orleans restaurant. This Garden District landmark serves all of the local staples, like turtle soup, gumbo, and barbecue shrimp, and it’s a great option for when getting a little dressed up sounds fun. If you want to drink 25-cent martinis while doing so, though, make a reservation for lunch, when you can get two courses for under $30 and a few cocktails that will collectively cost you less than a dollar. Depending on how you feel afterward, check out the historic Lafayette Cemetery across the street—this is one of the few instances when pregaming a trip to a cemetery makes complete sense.
Dooky Chase is a family-owned restaurant that used to be run by the late Leah Chase, a.k.a. “The Queen of Creole Cuisine.” That’s a massive title for anybody to hold, but you’ll see exactly why it was warranted: the restaurant does excellent gumbo, shrimp clemenceau, red beans and rice, and some of the best fried chicken in the city. Come for a fun weekday lunch, where you can sip on a spiked lavender lemonade or strawberry wine spritzers. They’re only open for dinner on Friday and Saturday (and it gets packed both nights), which is another reason we tend to stick to lunch.
Po’boy shops in New Orleans are as common as the discarded beads you’ll find on the street post-Mardi Gras. There are endless options, but if you want the best, head to Parkway Bakery in Mid-City. This corner sandwich shop is more than a century old and has been feeding everyone from local musicians to presidents since they first opened. The two standout sandwiches are the fried oysters (only available Wednesdays and Thursdays) and the roast beef with gravy, though the surf and turf with fried shrimp is a great way to satisfy any meat-and-seafood cravings you may have. Make sure to get yours dressed (lettuce, tomato, mayo, and pickles), and ask for some spicy mayo made with Crystal hot sauce.
There are a bunch of New Orleans restaurants where you can walk in and feel like you’re in another time period. Brigtsen’s is one of them, and they also have both some old-school Creole dishes and a Victorian cottage vibe. That means you’ll see things like veal sweetbreads, pan-roasted pork chops with debris gravy, and broiled Gulf fish with lemon crab sauce. Make a reservation for an anniversary dinner where you’ll hear the knowledgeable waiters talk extensively about what makes Gulf fish delicious.
Arnaud’s is located right off Bourbon Street, but it’s about as far removed as you can get from that tourist trap of a street. This classic New Orleans restaurant has been serving up great food, cocktails, and live jazz since 1918. The best time to come here is for their lively jazz brunch when they do a three-course, prix fixe with dishes like grillades and grits, eggs sardou, and shrimp arnaud. You should also make time for Arnaud’s French 75 Bar for a sazerac or an Old Fashioned.
One of the best free things you can do in New Orleans is walk through Uptown and the Garden District on Magazine Street. The whole stretch is lined with restaurants, bars, and shops, so you can snack and drink as you go. But one place you’ll want to prioritize for dinner is La Petite Grocery, a bistro that does modern takes on Creole fine dining. While the whole menu is excellent, the alligator bolognese is especially good.
If you only have brunch once in New Orleans, it should be at Brennan’s. This place opened more than 70 years ago and is known for both its excellent service and classic food, like eggs benedict and gumbo. If morning drinking is something you’re interested in, make sure to try the brandy milk punch. And if you don’t feel like battling the horde of bachelorette parties that flock to Brennan’s earlier in the day, dinner is also a great option. Save room for the bananas foster, which is set aflame table-side and falls in the category of foods that you should probably not recreate at home.
Casamento’s started serving oysters on Magazine Street more than 100 years ago and has barely changed since. Come here for lunch and stick to the bivalves, especially the fried oyster loaf sandwich, but also throw in some soft shell crab if it’s in season. As a forewarning, Casamento’s closes when Gulf oysters are out of season, which is from the end of May to the end of September, so plan your trip here accordingly.
Friday lunch at Galatoire’s is a New Orleans rite of passage and the best way to kick off a long weekend. To do it right, you need to sit in the downstairs dining room, which requires getting in line on Bourbon Street before it opens at 11:30am. You can make a reservation, but there’s no guarantee of being seated on the first floor other than just showing up early. Once you’re in, it’s basically an upscale party where the servers wear tuxedos, drinking is definitely encouraged, and you can eat old-school classics like shrimp remoulade and gumbo until you’re ready for a post-lunch nap. This place is just a ton of fun, partly because of the all-over-the-place crowd: you’ll probably see New Orleans judges in seersucker suits, society ladies, and plenty of bachelorette groups.
There are certain things you have to do at least once in New Orleans, like hear a brass band, walk (quickly) down Bourbon Street, and get at least one to-go beer or cocktail. Eating the wood-fired oysters with chili garlic butter at Cochon is also on that list. This spot in the Warehouse District opened more than a decade ago and serves great modern Cajun food, like fried boudin and catfish courtbouillon. But really, it’s all about the oysters. Sure, you can add more small plates like fried alligator or beef pie with horseradish, but a better option is to just get more oysters.
Located next door to the restaurant, Cochon Butcher is the more laidback, sandwich-centric version of its sister spot. Here, you can enjoy things like one of the city’s best muffulettas, a grilled cheese bacon melt, and something called Le Pig Mac, which is basically a double-decker pork burger with special sauce. If you’re putting together a list of lunch options in the city, make sure to include Cochon Butcher towards the top.
Eating at this legendary Uptown spot is as much of a party as it is an actual meal. The waits are long and it’s only open for dinner, but Jacques-Imo’s is an essential experience that you should have at least once in your life. Hang at the bar while you wait to be seated—you’ll be good and buzzed and very ready to try out the alligator sausage cheesecake and some shrimp étouffée. If you’re only eating with one other person, ask for the table in the back of the pickup truck parked out front, because when else is that going to be an option?
Pêche is a seafood place run by the same team as Cochon, and it takes fish as seriously as its sibling does pork and oysters. The large, open space, along with the seafood platters and whole grilled fish, makes this spot in the Warehouse District ideal for big groups (take note, bachelor and bachelorette parties). However, you can also come solo or with a date and just grab drinks and oysters at the bar for an equally classic experience.
Cafe Du Monde is as vintage as New Orleans gets. And while it’s one of the most touristy spots in the city, it’s been serving coffee and beignets in the same location on Jackson Square since 1862. The long, unorganized line and near-guarantee of showing up in the background of someone else’s vacation photos is worth it—the beignets are always hot, generously caked in powdered sugar, and make for a satisfying snack in between all your other eating plans.
This spot is Temporarily Closed.
Beignets, oysters, and gumbo are all on the Mt. Rushmore of New Orleans’ greatest dishes, and the fourth spot is reserved for the fried chicken at Willie Mae’s Scotch House. Located in the Treme, this place is vintage NOLA at its very best and feels more like you’re eating in someone’s house than an actual restaurant. It closes at 5pm daily and waits can be upwards of two hours during the lunch rush, so we recommend going for a late lunch around 3pm. They’re temporarily closed because of a fire, but you can order their chicken for nationwide shipping.
This spot is Temporarily Closed.
The po’boy might be the most famous sandwich in New Orleans, but the muffuletta—a giant Italian sandwich that can easily feed four people—is a close second. You can find it across the city, but it was invented at Central Grocery in the French Quarter, and that’s where you should eat one. This Italian specialty shop looks like it’s from another century, which makes sense since it opened in 1906. There’s always a lunch crowd, but they’re constantly churning out muffulettas, so the line moves quick. They’re currently under construction, but you can still get their muffalettas next door at Sidney’s Wine Cellar, and other spots around town. They also ship nationwide.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/amtrak-train-adirondacks-route-returns-spring,Thrillist,"After a multi-year hiatus due to the pandemic, one of the most scenic train rides in the world is officially coming back—and tickets just went on sale for its long-awaited return.
Amtrak officials recently announced that the beloved route connecting NYC and Canada's Montreal, dubbed the Adirondack, will be active again starting April 3. In March 2020, the service was halted because of pandemic-mandated border closures.
Covering almost 400 miles of ground, the train ride is much longer than a car ride to the Canadian city. By car, it only takes four hours, while the train trip is roughly 10 hours long due to longer processing stops at the border. According to National Geographic, they are 10 hours well spent, as the publication ranked the trip as one of the world's top 10 most scenic rail trips.
""Whether you're experiencing the greatness of New York City, the culture of Montreal or the beauty of the Hudson Valley and Lake Champlain region, the return of the Adirondack provides customers with a reliable, relaxing and sustainable way to travel,"" Amtrak President Roger Harris said in a statement. ""Thanks to the strong support and advocacy of Senators Schumer and Gillibrand, Congresswoman Stefanik and our partners at NYSDOT, VIA Rail and the Federal Railroad Administration, we're proud to restore service to one of the most popular trains in the Northeast.""
In 2022, Amtrak relaunched another train route connecting NYC and Canada. Last June, the company reinstated the Maple Leaf line, which links the Big Apple with Toronto.
As for the Adirondack train, its first northbound train since 2020 is slated to depart New York Penn Station at 8:41 am on Monday, April 3, and it is due to arrive at Montreal's Gare Centrale (Central Station) at 8:16 pm. The first southbound train is scheduled to leave Montreal at 11:10 pm on April 4 and arrive in New York at 10:15 pm. Along the way are popular destinations like Albany-Rensselaer, Poughkeepsie, Saratoga Springs, and Schenectady.
Tickets for the Adirondack route are already available for purchase, and you can do so by visiting Amtrak's website."

https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/where-to-eat-outside-in-the-east-village,Theinfatuation,"Imagine for one (very upsetting) moment that you could only eat at restaurants in one NYC neighborhood. We’re not going to say the East Village would be the “right” answer, but we will say it definitely wouldn’t be the wrong one. From Alphabet City to Bowery, each street and avenue warrants one of those kind of catchy, kind of corny, unofficial, intra-neighborhood nicknames. So it’s no surprise that, with more restaurants than ever offering outdoor seating, it’s still a fantastic place to get brunch, lunch, or dinner. For proof, check out this guide. We’ll be adding places every day, so if you know of any spots we missed, please let us know at nyc@theinfatuation.com.
This spot is Permanently Closed.
This Southern spot has a very nice streetside patio covered in plants, and a canvas roof that’ll give you comfort on afternoons when the clouds can’t decide how they want to proceed. The first come, first served tables are available for dinner any day, as well as weekend brunch, and whenever you go, make sure to focus your order on the sweet tea-brined fried chicken served with honey tabasco sauce.
This popular Vietnamese spot in the East Village now has a few sidewalk tables that can seat up to four people. So whether you’re in the mood for chicken pho, papaya salad, or a brisket banh mi, Hanoi House has you covered. They’re open every day except Monday and if you stop by over the weekend, you can get breakfast options like an egg banh mi and Vietnamese coffee.
Oh you’ve had Rubirosa? Did you know that Rubirosa wouldn’t exist without the cracker-thin pies at Joe & Pats? Did you also know that the East Village location of this famous Staten Island pizza place has a somewhat-secret back patio where you can sit outside now. OK we will stop asking questions. Focus on the vodka or a white clam pie, and ask if you can sit in their backyard (even though they also have sidewalk seating available).
When the martini mood strikes and your freezer is out of vodka, head to Anyway Cafe’s outdoor area for Russian snacks, live guitar, and all of the vodka-based cocktails you could ever want.
Say you’re in more of a tequila and guacamole mood than a vodka and guitar mood, you can bop across the street from Anyway Cafe to Rosie’s. This Mexican spot is taking reservations for their outdoor tables ahead of time online, and they’re open for dinner on the weekdays and brunch and dinner starting at 1pm on weekends.
After a few months of takeout, this Korean restaurant in the East Village is now offering sidewalk seating. The restaurant is asking customers to make a reservation online ahead of time (there are a bunch of 90 minute slots available) but they’re also accepting walk-ins. If you go, get the dry aged steak burger with kimchi mayo.
Calling Ruffian a wine bar feels misleading considering we’d absolutely go just for their constantly changing menu of Eastern Mediterranean dishes. But not calling Ruffian a wine bar also feels inaccurate considering their wine list, which includes more than 250 bottles from small producers around the world, could keep us occupied for a very long time. Semantics aside, you should go to Ruffian, which is currently offering a $30 three-course tasting menu for the first time ever. You can reserve a table or walk-in from 4-11pm any day except Tuesday.
From the same people as Ruffian, Kindred is another great spot to drink natural wine and eat small plates in the East Village. Their sidewalk tables are under a big tent covered in hanging lights, so you won’t panic-sprint to the nearest scaffolding at the first sign of rain. Make a reservation ahead of time through their website, and order some orange wine and housemade corzetti with spicy ’nduja any day from 4-10pm (11pm on weekends).
At Empellon Al Pastor on St. Marks, you order your tacos and drinks at their takeout window, seat yourself at one of their two-tops, and they’ll bring out your food when it’s ready. In addition to things like tiny, delicious al pastor tacos, Empellon is also serving bar snacks like corn dogs and an all-day breakfast burrito. They’re open at 4pm on weekdays and 1pm on weekends.
We recently walked by Niagara’s outdoor seating and overheard someone say “Yeah, Johnny was really big in the metal scene in the ’80s.” This person was pouring a pitcher of beer and eating a bag of chips. That’s Niagara in a nutshell. They have a bunch of covered outdoor tables right next to Tompkins Square Park, but know that their menu only includes drinks and bar food like burgers, hot dogs, and sandwiches.
Hosting a birthday party with three friends? Looking for brunch that involves lots of colorful cocktails? Miss Lily’s 7A is prepared for you. They have outdoor tables set up in their parking lane every day.
It’s 10:30am on a Saturday, and you want to sit outside and drink a caipirinha. Go to Esperanto, a neighborhood restaurant in Alphabet City that serves Caribbean and Latin American food. It’s also a great option for a casual dinner with a friend, which you can do any night by making a reservation through their website.
If eating a burger under an umbrella sounds appealing to you in the near future, know that David’s Cafe on St. Marks is open for outdoor service When you order their burger, ask for extra burger sauce on the side, and use it as a dip for the mountain of fries that comes with it.
Another solid burger and bar food option is Whitman’s on East 9th Street. This part of the block stays relatively calm, so keep this in mind when you decide you are no longer interested in loud noises and people drinking pitchers of margaritas.
Poco is another busy brunch spot on Avenue B that’s been offering outdoor seating for years. The food here is a mix of Spanish, American, and Mexican, which means you can order guacamole to go with your lobster mac and cheese, and shrimp and leek croquetas. They recently started taking reservations for their outdoor area (which you can make on Yelp), and they’re serving a bottomless deal every weekend.
From lunch with an ex-colleague who has strong opinions about east versus west coast oysters, to dinner with three friends who all have wildly different ideas about what the word “casual” means, The Smith is always there when you need it. This American spot’s East Village location has a bunch of patio seating, which you can reserve through their website, for lunch, dinner, or weekend brunch.
Mimi Cheng’s is offering outdoor seating for walk-ins from 1-9pm. Get some chicken and zucchini or pork and chive dumplings on their patio on 2nd Avenue, and then pick up one of their frozen dumpling kits to-go, which you can order ahead of time through their website.
Somtum Der on Avenue A makes eight different different versions of papaya salad, and it would be reasonable to visit their sidewalk seating area several times to try them every kind. Our favorite, though, is the one with fermented fish sauce and crab. Pair that with a spicy mountain of larb ped and sticky rice, and the grilled coconut pork skewers.
Like this Italian spot’s West Village locations, Fiaschetteria on East 11th Street is open every day starting at 5:30pm. But what’s different about their East Village location is not only the pasta specials - spaghetti vongole and tagliatelle with black truffle - but also the fact that they take reservations. You can make one by calling 212-777-3355.
If you’re looking for vegan options outdoors, Double Zero on 2nd Avenue is serving its plant-based pizzas on their patio from noon to10pm from Monday to Wednesday, and noon to 11pm Thursday to Sunday.
Supper works for pretty much any situation that involves eating spaghetti al limone and drinking wine outside. When you find yourself in one of those situations, make a reservation at this East Village Italian spot through their website or by calling 212-420-0040.
Royale is still one of the best patios and best burgers in the East Village. Along with their backyard, they now have seating out front as well. Reservations are encouraged, and you can make one by calling (212) 254-6600.
The spicy salami pizza, chicken parm with spaghetti pomodoro, and all of the other dishes that make this Italian spot an East Village staple are being served every day from 11am-11pm. Reserve an outdoor table ahead of time by emailing reservations@frankcares.com.
This massive Mediterranean spot from the people behind Tao has a less massive outdoor patio in front of the Moxy East Village. Dishes like steak frites with escargot butter and scallops with summer squash ratatouille are available for dinner Tuesday through Saturday, with reservations available through their website.
Every outdoor table at Westville East comes with its very own wooden cubicle-like wall. This way you can feel fully separated from the table next to you fighting over who is ordering fries.
This vegetarian Szechuan spot set up a few sidewalk tables in front of their location on East 6th Street. Expect vegan dan dan noodles, mapo tofu, and dry pot specials.

McDonald's doesn't have the best reputation when it comes to health food. Instead of trying to revamp its image, the Austrian branch of the company is doubling down. Behold the ""McDonald's Schmankerl Mix,"" a big ol' bucket of assorted fried things.
It comes with 15 Chicken McNuggets; 10 fried, heart-shaped Emmentaler cheese puffs; and a choice of four sauces. In fairness to McDonald's Austria, it's unlikely anyone is visiting the chain specifically to order a salad, despite its attempt to rebrand. But this is a pretty extreme example of over-the-top gluttony. Cardiologists in the county must be smiling.
Perhaps McDonald's Austria thinks this is a typical meal in the United States, and it's simply attempting to pay homage to the company's American roots. This dish sounds like something that might be found on the menu at Fat Ammy's in Wee Britain."

https://www.eater.com/2019/12/3/20974732/authentic-food-definition-yelp,Eater,"AboutAbout a decade ago, the most important thing food could be was authentic. “Authenticity” was the buzzword that propelled people to seek out so-called hole-in-the-wall taco joints over Qdoba and blast their exploits all over Yelp. Places like Eataly popped up with the promise of “real” Italian ingredients over the impostors you’d find at your ShopRite. Could you even be someone who liked food if the food you ate wasn’t authentic?
But just as it rose, so did it fall. In 2011, Todd Kliman wrote in Lucky Peach that authenticity was “a purely arbitrary, purely subjective surmise of a purely impure thing.” In 2012, Eddie Huang lamented the prototype of someone who “wants to tell ME what Chinese food is because Bear Stearns sent him to Shanghai for six months.” The public discussion of authenticity in food began to feel cliche, the language of insufferable foodies more concerned with appearing to have the correct tastes than doing any tasting. The word buzzed no more.
In May of 2018, chef Preeti Mistry tweeted that “Curry is a social construct” and continued with a thread about the word’s confusing relationship with Indian cuisine. “#currypowder is to India what #italianseasoning is to Italy… a fucking joke, amirite?” they wrote. This year, writer Khushbu Shah echoed the sentiment, tweeting that only “colonizers” eat curry. The semantics behind the word “curry” are long and complicated, but the argument arose because, among some white people, “curry” has become a catch-all phrase for all Indian cuisine, a flattening of the varied and multicultural cooking of more than 1 billion people. Both Mistry and Shah argued that no self-respecting South Asian chef would be caught dead with “curry powder” — the yellow miasma of spices often used to “jazz up” a mayonannaise-y chicken salad — in their kitchens. For these two, it was just another example of how their cuisine has been butchered for a white palate.
The Twitter debate was a bit of a tweetstorm in a teacup, with each side consisting of smart people who care deeply about how their culture’s cuisines are interpreted by a white supremacist society. And the core of what they were arguing about is authenticity — what it is and who gets to define it, as well as what counts as a taint on a cuisine and what has been lovingly adopted into the traditions. Lucky Peach’s book 101 Easy Asian Recipes cheekily billed itself as “100% inauthentic,” putting okonomiyaki in the same book as “Mall Chicken.” New restaurants like Call Your Mother and Nightshade ditch verisimilitude for a more open-minded approach to their cuisines, with Call Your Mother advertising itself as “Jew-ish.” The authenticity is not the sell, and in fact, it sounds a lot like “fusion.” It’s clear that something about the conversation on authenticity has changed, broadening into a debate about innovation, interpretation, and change and recognizing that no cuisine, or culture, is static. Welcome to Authenticity 2.0.
Authenticity wasn’t always such a weaponized term in the food world. “I was reading the intro to Madhur Jaffrey’s book An Invitation to Indian Cooking, and she uses the word authentic a lot as a way to distinguish between the food that’s served in restaurants and what’s eaten at home,” says Priya Krishna, food writer and author of the cookbook Indian-Ish. When Jaffrey’s book was published, in 1973, most Americans’ understanding of Indian food came from take-out restaurants and buffets, a deeply delicious version of Indian cuisine, but one that’s also limited in scope. “Authentic,” for Jaffrey, meant food specific to different regions and different traditions of India, and food that is cooked by Indians for Indians, not to suit the American palate. Jaffrey wrote, however, that non-Indian Americans at the time were yearning “to experience the ‘real’ thing, an authentic taste,” and wrote her cookbook to suit those desires. This is authenticity, and cultural exchange, at its best — the willingness to center and value another culture’s traditions.
Fusion wasn’t a controversial word yet. At the time, it was exciting that chefs could take traditional flavors and techniques and do something new with them, like Wolfgang Puck putting salmon on pizza, or restaurants in Los Angeles serving caviar on plantains and black beans. As a diverse taste in food became more culturally valuable, a willingness to experiment and try new things was the hallmark of the proto-foodie. And honestly, what is the point of cooking if not to experiment with what tastes good? But while it might have been a true stroke of genius that led Puck to combine smoked salmon and pizza, what it inspired were cynical ploys like sushi burritos and chocolate hummus. Critics began to point out that anyone (and usually it was white chefs) could spin the wheel and call it innovation, no matter how unoriginal or disinteresting the fusion meal actually was. By the early 2000s, fusion was passé. The pendulum swung and the new goal became finding the most traditional, authentic cuisine out there, made by the people who originated it.
The search for the authentic was also aided by apps like Foursquare and Yelp, which allowed users to bypass reviewers and guides as the main sources of where to eat. Now anyone could be an authority on what kind of food had value and, conversely, what was valueless. Foursquare even allowed users to prioritize listings that other users reported were “authentic.” The jackpot was the “hole in the wall” taco place, the basement noodle shop, the spot that didn’t have a menu in English. “Today’s American has much greater exposure to diverse cultures than an American 20 years ago. And as once-exotic things like sushi or yoga become mainstream, we seek new, more niche markers of cultural authenticity,” said Alexandra Smith, the director of consumer trends at Mintel, in 2012. If you were introduced to Chinese cuisine at a Panda Express or Mexican food at Taco Bell, you could now seek out the “real” without some sort of insider knowledge.
However, what consumers deemed “real” was heavily influenced by whiteness. Americans still largely consider European-influenced cuisine as the norm (see any “new American” menu for proof), and their opinions of what is authentic extend from that center point. In 2015, researcher Stephen Christ studied the subjectivity of “authenticity” when it came to Mexican restaurants, and found the use of the word depended largely on the customer, not the chef. “The owner of a Mexican restaurant may claim to have the most authentic facility because his chef is from Mexico or he has more employees from Mexico than any of his competitors,” he said. “But for the consumer, the most important consideration is ‘how much does this food fit my expectation of what Mexican food is based on growing up and having taco day at high school or eating at fast-food taco restaurants?’” It’s based on a preconceived notion of what “real” Mexican food is, regardless of what relationship the diner has to Mexican cuisine in the first place. Authenticity is about aesthetics as much as anything else.
Outside of the mythical hole-in-the-wall, the conversation about authenticity is often pegged to attention and value — who gets to cook what and who gets praised for it. At the crest of the authenticity wave, two men became lightning rods for everything the word could mean, good or bad: Andy Ricker and Rick Bayless. Both white men, both cooking cuisines from countries they are neither from nor from which they claim heritage (Thailand and Mexico, respectively), both receiving accolades over their cooking followed almost immediately by accusations of cultural appropriation. It’s not as though either claimed to cook the most authentic Thai or Mexican food — each had been inspired at some point by these cuisines, and decided to dedicate their careers to it, while giving plenty of credit to their sources. But to some, they represented exactly why fine dining and non-European cuisine shouldn’t mix.
But Bayless, at one point, did suggest that it was his whiteness (or at least non-Mexicanness) that made him a good arbiter of Mexican cuisine. “My greatest gift is that I don’t have a Mexican grandmother,” he told Francis Lam at the New York Times in 2012, “so I can look at all Mexican grandmothers as equal. If you grew up with this food, you’ll defend to the death the way your family makes a dish. So sometimes, with lots of experience, you can speak with a bit of a broader perspective.” Bayless’s “assertion and assumption of disconnected distance — valued as ‘objectivity,’” as researcher Cecilia Cissell Lucas put it — is right out of the colonizer’s playbook, and something food media bought into easily. The underlying assumption was that Bayless, by not being inherently bogged down in the cultural dynamics of a place or culture, could see it more clearly.
The question of which cuisines can be “elevated,” and by whom, drives much of the authenticity debate. Eater’s Jenny Zhang wrote about how that dynamic was depicted in the Netflix film Always Be My Maybe, in which Sasha Tran (played by Ali Wong) plays a hot-shot chef who runs a number of fusion restaurants. The viewer is “meant to side-eye” her career, writes Zhang, until her childhood sweetheart reminds her “Asian food isn’t supposed to be ‘elevated,’ it’s supposed to be authentic” — homey, traditional, and not subject to innovation through Western ingredients or new techniques. As white chefs face outrage for cooking cuisine that isn’t their own, nonwhite chefs are saddled with guilt or confusion for straying from tradition. Both situations are driven by the notion that European food is upscale and innovative, while basically everything else is inherently cheap, casual, and stagnant.
Wanting authentic cuisine became an easy punchline to a joke about millennial foodies and their Instagram accounts, and diners and chefs alike backed down from using the word, understanding that it played into stereotypes and assumptions that could be more harmful than good. “I think the word and the use of that word has been sufficiently questioned where people know not to try to wield it like a weapon anymore. Or a shield, for that matter,” says Lam. But authentic cuisine — cuisine that reflects a certain culture’s traditions and that is made with intention, care, and knowledge — is not a bad thing to want. In fact, it’s still the baseline of how most food is judged.
“I get what people are looking for, and I get that [authenticity] is a valuable thing. I just think that the vast majority of us and the vast majority of times we use that word, we’re not allowing for the realities of the world and nuances of the world to come into play too,” says Lam. The goal, then, becomes figuring out what, exactly, someone means when they ask for “authenticity.” Some people are looking for dirt-cheap tacos that fit their limited idea of what Mexican food should be. Others are looking for dishes they tasted decades ago in their birth countries. And then there are those who are searching for food that speaks to every part of themselves, even if that looks closer to “fusion.” The latter is what Soleil Ho spoke of as “assimilation food,” and what Dale Talde calls “diaspora cooking.” He has described his restaurants as “inauthentically Asian,” a subtle “fuck you” to those who’d say his menus are not really Filipino. But make no mistake, he is making authentic food — it’s just authentic to a different kind of experience, one of a kid born in Chicago to a Filipino family, and who wants to represent the entirety of his background and influences.
It is still easy to get sucked into the authenticity quicksand, one-upping friends over the most obscure (to Americans) and elusive dishes, over-explaining history, and even fetishizing a certain kind of fusion, like the type that Krishna and Talde cook. If how one eats is an inherent part of one’s identity, then the goalposts of what kind of food should be valued will forever shift. Right now, it’s specificity, but in another five years we may cycle back to fusion.
Like gender, race, and money, authenticity is a social construct — something that we’ve given a certain amount of power to as a society, but that is ultimately ours to define, or to give up on entirely. It doesn’t have to be the notch against which we measure cuisine, but for it not to be, other major shifts are still necessary. People of color and immigrants would need the space to experiment without their identities getting called into question. White chefs and diners would have to stop fetishizing immigrants just for their food. We’d have to accept that there may not actually be a battle between protecting tradition and valuing change, that these concepts could live side by side. We still have a long way to go toward centering chefs of color, undoing white assumptions about “ethnic” cuisine, and valuing thoughtful innovation over the novelty of a white chef making a sushi burrito. Authenticity will probably always mean different things to different people. But maybe the next goal is recognizing every definition of the word.

But much like the once ubiquitous “going out” top, such tours have become a rare (albeit ongoing) sight. Many of the restaurants featured on the original show, which ran from 1998 to 2004 and somehow never addressed 9/11, have long been closed. The women’s favorite hangout, Coffee Shop in Union Square, closed in 2018 and has been replaced by a Chase bank. City Bakery, where Carrie re-encounters “the face girl” Nina Katz, has also permanently closed its doors, denying the city its top-rate chocolate chip cookies.
But still, there are bars and restaurants. Bars and restaurants on the brink of doom, sure, but they’re hanging on all the same. No pandemic or death of a loved one by Peleton (for the best, it seems) will stop Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte — sans Samantha, as actor Kim Cattrall who declined to return to the series due to friction with lead and executive producer Sarah Jessica Parker — from dining across the city.
Want to pretend like it’s 2004 again? Well, throw on some low-rise jeans and Manolos and hit the town (masked and boosted, or better yet, maybe just in your imagination). Here, we’ll be charting every restaurant, bar, and cafe that makes a featured appearance on And Just Like That... for your touring convenience. Obviously, there will be some spoilers.
This premiere was obviously dominated by one major controversy, which has little to do with food and that’s Carrie not attempting CPR or calling 911 as Big flopped around on the floor of their gigantic shower and died.
Before her first class at Columbia where she’s enrolled to get her master’s degree in “Human Rights,” Miranda stops for a drink at this theater district mainstay and while she’s there, we’re introduced to an exciting new character: Miranda’s Alcoholism! She tries to order a glass of chablis at 10:45 a.m., which, yes, is pretty early for wine, but more concerning is why she’d stop at a bar on 8th and West 44th Street, which is nowhere near her townhouse in Brooklyn or Columbia University, which is all the way up on West 114th Street.
In Manhattan, there are plenty of bars to get lost in and most of them, fortunately, are not next to Times Square.
This episode is mostly taken up by Big’s ugly and sparse funeral at the Greene Naftali Gallery and not so much on the streets of New York City, which, as everyone knows, is the show’s other leading lady.
Carrie does however stare wistfully at a couple eating on the patio of the East Pole, located on the Upper East Side. The couple remind her of her and Big, because the woman is blonde and the man has dark hair and is wearing an expensive suit. Understandably, this makes grieving Carrie sad, but she shouldn’t be. As far as she knows, that guy works for the Blackstone Group or makes his money developing property that displaces poor people. Maybe Big did that, too. Anyway, lunch looked nice and we’ll be revisiting the East Pole later.
Did you know that even Charlotte’s best friend Anthony got into sourdough during the pandemic? Only he turned it into a bustling business called Hot Fellas (did the writers even try on this one?), where the bread is delivered by... hot fellas. This scene is largely marked by Anthony’s dismissal of Charlotte’s child’s trans identity, stating that kids are confused and Charlotte should ignore it. Good to know that, in addition to making bread, he’s up to date on Jesse Singal’s Substack.
Anyway, I will not be ordering my bread from Hot Fellas in the future.
More fun than the restaurant itself, though, is Stanford (played by the late Willie Garson) telling Charlotte that he used to work at the iconic Tribeca bistro Odeon, and that’s how he knows a three-top can always become a four-top. Many servers will disagree!
Charlotte, Miranda, and Miranda’s many bottles of airport cart Tito’s wait for Carrie at this Starbucks in SoHo, right across the street from Balthazar (once featured in Sex and the City under the name Balzac). In a TV series full of necessary belief-suspension, this one will put you over the edge because that Starbucks location has never had less than 700 people stuffed into it at one time, and that’s an official statistic. Also the barista brings Miranda a muffin to her table and it’s even on a plate. In real life, the overworked barista would have shouted “MORGANDA?” and hurled it at her from the register.
It’s at Chalait, a cafe specializing in matcha drinks, that Carrie is finally able to corner Big’s ex-wife Natasha by accidentally walking in on her while she’s trying to take a piss in peace, but with the door puzzlingly unlocked. (What’s unbelievable here is that there’s a New York coffee shop where you don’t need a special code or key to get into the bathroom.) In the fumble to close the door, Carrie spills hot coffee and burns herself, so maybe Chalait is actually good...
Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda go to see Carrie’s colleague Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez) shoot their standup special at venue Webster Hall. Afterward, Miranda, her sexuality re-awakened by Che’s wit, sticks around for the afterparty. Che, not disinterested, shotguns a mouthful of weed vape into Miranda’s mouth. DeBlasio’s New York, baby!
In reality, Cafe Kitsuné is in the West Village, right around the corner from the shooting location of Carrie’s brownstone and nowhere near the Upper East Side where Charlotte and her family lives. Similarly inconvenient is the distance between Parliament Espresso and the City Museum of New York. These details are not to nitpick the show, which can rearrange locations as it sees fit. Rather it’s to help you maximize your inevitable And Just Like That... walking tour.
I struggled to identify this location where Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte have brunch and discuss Carrie’s plans to sell the apartment she shared with Big. Thankfully, Karli Mullane, who runs the Instagram account Celeb Map, reached out over email to tell me she had identified it as the Upper East Side location of Sant Ambroeus, a Milanese-inspired restaurant and wine bar. Funny because Carrie soon shares a cocktail with her realtor at...
Having befriended the outgoing, Samantha-esque Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), Carrie joins her at the Soho location of Sant Ambroeus, which is, in real life, a great place to spot models, actors, and the paparazzi who follow them. (Sarah Jessica Parker is a regular.) Here, the fast friends decide to split the cacio e pepe, even after Carrie rudely gives kudos to Seema for continuing to “put yourself out there” on dating apps. Luckily, pasta heals all wounds.
There was plenty of action in the kitchen (that’s right, I’m talkin’ sex) during the fifth episode of And Just Like That, but only one scene in a restaurant.
Freehold is a cafe, bar, events space, and workspace in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It is also where Charlotte, Miranda, Carrie, and Anthony have brunch after Carrie learns she needs hip surgery. Later in the episode, Carrie pees in an empty Snapple bottle. Not a restaurant scene, but it does feel worth mentioning.
When Miranda is fantasizing about having sex with Che Diaz — “Oh, yeah, yeah, I get that,” even Charlotte admits — she’s having a leisurely coffee with her professor-cum-friend (but not, like, cum friend, as we must clarify for shows like this) Dr. Nya Wallace. The pair walk through the park carrying cups of joe from the NYC coffee chain Joe Coffee Company. There’s a location conveniently located at Columbia University, though it’s been temporary closed probably because of the pandemic, which in the world of And Just Like That..., has all but disappeared. Good for them!
Another big thank you to Karli Mullane of Celeb Map, who tipped us off to the location of the brunch spot — Bistrot Leo — where Carrie tells Miranda and Charlotte that she sold the apartment she shared with Big and bought a downtown apartment that looks like an Apple Store instead. And she doesn’t even like the new apartment! Money, like these picked-at meals in beautiful spaces, is wasted on the rich!
Nya has bonded with Miranda thanks to her own uncertainty about motherhood and Miranda’s no bullshit approach to the subject. Unfortunately, Miranda can’t help her when Nya and her husband meet up with another couple, who are expecting their third baby, for dinner at Le Crocodile, a restaurant inside the Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Fun little bit of history: While in the show, Nya mentions that the restaurant was once a shoe factory, the actual Wythe was built in 1901 as cooperage, or barrel factory.
Miranda runs into Nya and her hot husband at a greenmarket at McGlorick Park in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. Don’t rush out now — it’s a seasonal farmers market that doesn’t pick up again until spring. Still, the park is beautiful and you can always stop at the nearby outpost for Variety Coffee, which has gone from a singular coffee shop that opened in Williamsburg in 2009 to a citywide chain that has now appeared (on to-go cup branding, at least) multiple times in And Just Like That... Allow me one moment of sentimentality: I used to sit at the original Variety in 2009 and 2010 as an unemployed person, sending out resumes and freelance pitches to anywhere I could think of. I lusted after their hot baristas, got their coffee on the way to the train when I was a desperately hungover after a night of being a 24-year-old idiot, and became friendly acquaintances with the fellow regular who’d come in to watch wrestling on his laptop all day. And just like that... my lil’ roastery is all grown up and starring on HBO. I could cry!
The women, now including Seema because a three-top throws off the entire balance of a table and a scene, meet for dinner at jewel-toned, pre-pandemic hot spot Quality Bistro. The restaurant, with its arched green-lit bar, look like a restaurant you’d find in the Emerald City of Oz’s arts district.  Which is to say, very pretty.
After turning in her book on widowhood, Carrie’s publisher suggests she go on one date for the purpose of writing an epilogue that would make her readership — which craves fun and frivolity over grief and husbands killed via Peleton — hopeful that she might find love again.
Little does she know that Seema, bored because of a real estate slump, has already been busy making a variety of online dating profiles for her. “You listed me?,” Carrie quips, a classic Bradshaw bon mot.
Carrie ends up going on first date at high-end burger outpost Au Cheval — once described as a “meaty, retrograde misfire” by Eater NY critic Ryan Sutton — with a math teacher from the school Charlotte’s daughters attend. The date starts out kind of nice. Similar to Carrie, this is his first date since losing his spouse, and the widow and widower decide to get blotto because life is short. This too ends up being a meaty misfire as it ends with them both blowing chunks on the street outside the restaurant. Now we’re talking! The next morning, Carrie considers the date a total misfire, hope be damned, but the math teacher isn’t so easily deterred by acts of public vomiting. He ends up bidding $1,050 for a date with Carrie during a school benefit auction and Carrie ends up being kind of happy about it. It’s the hopeful epilogue she needs to make it into Oprah’s Bookclub. More hopeful to me, however, is that a math teacher (even a private school math teacher!) could afford to bid a full grand to save the pride of the woman he barfed on.
This episode begins at a pride rally in Foley Square in lower Manhattan. From a dais, Che does some “comedy” about being true to oneself then shouts out “our LGBTQ+ allies,” who are not so much interspersed with the crowd as they are...corralled in one area? From the queer section, Miranda spots her son Brady standing in the ally holding area and makes a run for it because she’s not out to him yet, nor has she told his father that she wants a divorce.
To smooth things over for bailing on Che’s act, she returns with iced coffees from her standby, Joe Coffee Company, but it doesn’t do the trick. Che finds out that Miranda has been using them to cheat on her husband, Steve, and, as a devotee of honesty, ends things. Welp, looks like Miranda should’ve brought coffees from one of the nearby — and superior — Australian cafes like Bluestone Lane or Black Fox. Or told Che that she left because their comedy is unbearable. Either option would’ve left things less bitter.
Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda meet for a meal at the Lobster Place, located inside the Chelsea Market. While there, Miranda tells her friends that she’s going to ask her husband for a divorce so she can live a more honest life with Che, if they’ll have her. Charlotte then shares that her daughter Lily, now 15, was left emotionally and physically bruised after Charlotte slammed a door in her face because she walked in on her and husband Harry having oral sex. Carrie and Miranda are more shaken that Charlotte is still giving BJs in her 50s. Anyway, there’s always great conversations to be had over lobster rolls.
After all that blowjob talk, Carrie and Miranda go to the Chelsea Market bakery Fat Witch so Carrie can buy her cool, young, jewelry-designing downstairs neighbor Lisette (Katerina Tannenbaum) some brownies. While there, she encourages Miranda to buy Steve some brownies, too, because it will make the divorce news slightly sweeter. That’s not going to help, Carrie! If anything, Steve will be turned off expensive, luxury brownies for life.
Charlotte takes Lily out to lunch at this airy Parisian-style brasserie so that they can have a mature conversation on what Lily walked in and why Charlotte freaked out the way that she did. Unfortunately, the meal is interrupted before Lily can take a sip of her damn iced tea because Charlotte learns about her daughter’s finsta account where she’s recently posted a photo of herself posing sexily in workout gear. Charlotte panics, thinking her daughter is already beyond her guidance with regards to sexuality, and Lily walks out. But it all turns out okay! After some time at Auntie Carrie’s, Lily confides in Charlotte that she was just experimenting with expressing herself on a private Instagram account that’s only followed by her best girlfriends and someone’s younger brother named Connor. Maybe they can return to La Grande Boucherie for the rest of their lunch soon.
I’ll note that Seema is again seen eating at Sant Ambroeus during this episode, but beyond this mention, I refuse to write about that restaurant in this space ever again.
The penultimate And Just Like That... episode begins in a cozy, brown leather corner booth at Lafayette Grande Cafe and Bakery in the Bowery near Astor Place, a beautiful neighborhood with brick streets, fancy shops, and luxury hotels. Until recently, it was also the location of Manhattan’s last remaining Kmart, which you could enter directly from the subway which, along with the store’s mostly unstocked shelves, really led to that fifth circle of hell vibe that makes New York City feel like home.
At the restaurant, Charlotte reveals that she’s officially in menopause, a plot point that would’ve merited an entire episode in the halcyon Sex and the City days, as my viewing buddy Joanna Rothkopf pointed out. It’s also over this brunch that Miranda asks her friends to come help with a volunteer project at a women’s shelter in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. When Carrie, no fan of manual labor, offers a donation instead, Miranda replies, “You can’t be the white lady who just writes a check. If I can paint, you can paint!” Disagree, Miranda! Carrie is the exact type who should just write a check because she will — and does — get in the way. It takes her all day to paint one room and most of her time in the shelter is spent ruining her beautiful, highly impractical high heels and dissolving into histrionics when she accidentally drops her dead husband’s wedding ring (again, why wear it while painting!) down the drain. Had I been supervising that women’s shelter, I would’ve much preferred the money.
Miranda and Che share a meal at this chic, renovated railcar diner that you can find under the High Line in Chelsea. It’s here that Che encounters some fans — sorry, don’t believe it! — and Miranda boldly identifies herself as Che’s girlfriend. No friend to traditional relationships, Che’s not having it. A great time to move on from this character and the maniac Miranda has become, but no. Che-ck, please.
Initially deciding to give the math teacher who barfed at Au Cheval a second chance, Carrie meets him again in front of the West Village location of Dante, a very trendy cocktail lounge and restaurant. They don’t make it past the door, though, because Carrie has only arrived dressed to the nines in order to tell him she’s not actually ready to date again and wanted to tell him in person. Call him on the phone, Carrie! This poor man on a teacher’s salary took a yellow cab to see you and now you’re plopping him right back in one with no offer to cover the fare! Also, have these two considered the insane concept of friendship? Seems like a recent widow and widower could provide a lot of support for each other in a way that doesn’t involve mashing face or other body parts. Have a negroni! Talk about your lives! Or just keep having unromantic dates that end with awkward kisses. What the hell do I care.
Miranda makes a fool of herself yet again by surprising Che with cookies from the Italian bakery Veniero’s, an East Village institution which has been open since late 1800s. Isn’t that incredible?! Even more incredible is none of Che’s neighbors yelling at the couple to shut the hell up as they have the loudest conversation about commitment and taking things slowly in the middle of the dang stairwell.
When the caterers bail for Nya’s volunteer event — the one where they’re spending hours painting a single room of a women’s shelter — Charlotte’s friend Lisa Todd Wexley steps up by calling in a herd of food trucks from various beloved restaurants. There’s a truck for Tacos El Bronco, a Mexican restaurant with a brick-and-mortar at 4324 4th Avenue in Brooklyn; Makina Cafe, an Ethiopian-Eritrean eatery located at 36-47 30th Street in Queens; and Roberta’s, the pioneering Bushwick wood oven-pizza restaurant, dined at at least once by Beyoncé, located at 261 Moore Street in Brooklyn (but now with other locations across the city).
First of all, I want to end this journey with a big thank you to CelebMap’s Karli Mullane, who’s been a huge help and fun, unexpected partner in ID’ing these many restaurants. It’s thanks to her that I didn’t spend hours trying to figure out where Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte are eating at the beginning of the And Just Like That... finale because guess what? It’s an event space designed to look like a restaurant. The magic of production design!
Miranda goes to meet Che’s family at this Latin American restaurant in Soho and is surprised when Che gets up on stage to perform a rendition of the Beach Boy’s “California Girls” (they make it clear, though, that they’re actually doing the Van Halen version). This is their way of telling all their friends that they’re moving to California to produce a pilot, a surprise even to Miranda. May I clarify something? I actually really like the actor Sara Ramirez (“I don’t recognize myself in Che,” they recently told the New York Times, thank god), but this scene actually murdered me with second-hand embarrassment. I’m a ghost now, like Big, only instead of haunting a lamp on Carrie’s bookshelf, I’m forced to write and re-write this blog for eternity.
Carrie meets Big’s brother Richard at this Jean-Gorges restaurant off the West Side Highway in Greenwich village. Over this four-dollar-sign lunch, Richard asks what’s going on with Big’s ashes and suggests Carrie inters them at the family crypt in Connecticut where one day, if she’s interested, there’d be room for her to join him.
Anyway, it’s in this dream that Carrie realizes she wants to bring Big’s ashes to Paris, the city where they reunited for good, but also where she got slapped by Petrovsky? And where Big met Natasha, who he married before Carrie and divorced because he and Carrie had an affair? All I’m trying to say is there are better choices (say Napa or Central Park), but it’s not my show and if it was, I would have let SJP keep her Paris hat.
And just like that...we’ve reached the end of And Just Like That..."
https://www.thrillist.com/eat/dallas/best-fried-food-at-the-texas-state-fair-fried-chicken-in-a-waffle-fried-lemonade,Thrillist,"Stiffler BrothersChicken and waffles make for fine hangover food, but it takes SO much work to lift a fork and knife after a long night. Enter Texas Fried Chicken in a Waffle. All you have to do is hold your arm to your mouth and eat. Fried chicken is layered in a waffle cone and smothered in sausage gravy with a sweet surprise at the bottom of the cone. Don’t get sick riding the Ferris wheel.
Stiffler BrothersThey said lemonade could never be fried -- which is a weird thing to say. Well, they were WRONG! Kind of. Take a lemonade-based cream sauce, place in a cup, add a fried lemon cake on top, insert spoon, and devour. If you can’t please your significant other by winning an enormous stuffed animal, this is probably your next best option.
The Dock, Fernie's Funnel CakesNo, this is not the title to a remix of a certain '90s R&B song, but it IS a sexy fried desert. Sexy because that’s what happens when you take peach slices and sprinkle them with brown sugar, dip them in coconut, cinnamon, nutmeg tempura & batter, and then coat with graham cracker & panko breadcrumbs, followed by a slow deep-fry. When they get so hot that they can’t take it any more, they’re gently drizzled with raspberry sauce and given sides of vanilla butter-cream and topped with whipped cream. Wait, this sort of DOES sound like lyrics to a '90s R&B song.
The Dock, Fernie's Funnel CakesRemember that time you came home from college to visit and hungrily ate everything in your parents' fridge all at once? Us too. That describes the Twisted Texas Taco, except it's an improvement over whatever horrific creation you produced. The taco is stuffed full with hickory-smoked brisket that's coated in chili cheese Fritos and then chicken fried, layered with Mexican cheese, green Verde sauce, coleslaw, Poblano corn, and fried okra. If that isn’t enough, it’s served with a side of blended creamy country gravy and spicy chili. Pro tip: have plenty of napkins handy, your mother won’t be able to clean up after you this time around.
The Dock, Fernie's Funnel CakesMeat-on-a-stick is so 2013. How about fried grilled cheese? It’s a new take on a simple classic, and it's amazing. Plus, it’s served with a warm side of tomato soup and shoestring fries. It’s like pre-school lunch all over again. Your inner-child will thank you, especially if your inner-child is chubby.
Stiffler Brothers Have you ever thought about what autumn would taste like if you ate it? Neither have we, but this is it and it tastes amazing. Inside is pumpkin, cream cheese & pumpkin seasoning, sandwiched between two ginger spice cookies, dipped in funnel cake, batter rolled in a confection of ground cookies, powder sugar & pumpkin seasoning, then served with fresh whipped cream.
Crazy Otto's Fair and Festival FoodsThis is better than ma’s meatloaf, because these meatloaf tenders are deep fried and served with cream gravy and spicy ketchup glaze. It tastes as good as it sounds. Don't mention anything to ma.
The Dock, Fernie's Funnel CakesThe only thing resembling a funnel will be your mouth when eating copious amounts of this addictive fried cake. Yes, it's not exactly a new innovation, but classics are classics for a reason. Ever since the early '80s, when Fernie Erpillo and family introduced this State Fair staple, thousands of people flock yearly to get their fix. You can easily pick them out by their recognizable and unsightly powdered sugar ring around their mouths.
Crazy Otto's Fair and Festival FoodsOne bite of this bad boy and you'll understand why it is this years 2014 Big Tex Choice Awards ""Best Taste"" winner. There are two shrimp balls stuffed with gulf shrimp, diced potato, kernel corn, onion, lemon, secret seasonings, and one jumbo shrimp, all deep fried to a golden brown, and served with a tangy rémoulade sauce on the side. Who said Fair food wasn't fancy?

https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/nyc-vaccinating-raccoon-population-against-rabies,Thrillist,"New York City just launched a new mass vaccination program, and this time, it has nothing to do with humans. The city is launching a program to vaccinate its raccoons against rabies, and it even involves helicopter drops.
On Monday, September 12, The Health Department, NYC Parks, and federal and academic partners officially launched the effort, which consists of scattering oral vaccines (hidden in brown-colored baits) in wooded areas of Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn. Staten Island's raccoons, instead, will receive their vaccine doses via helicopter, which will drop the vaccine baits next month on the borough's wooded and marshy regions. The program will last into October, and it is aimed at vaccinating the largest number of raccoons possible.
Attracting the animals is fairly simple. Reportedly, the bait smells like fish, and when the raccoons bite into it, it releases a pink liquid that acts like an oral vaccine. The vaccine itself is not harmful to humans, but if a person comes in contact with it, it can cause a rash. If that happens, residents are encouraged to wash their hands with warm and soapy water and talk to their doctor, and they should also notify the NYC Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222. Baits aren't harmful to other animals and pets either, but they could cause vomiting if ingested.
The new rabies vaccination program is part of the City's effort to create a safer and healthier environment where humans and animals can peacefully coexist. ""Rabies is a serious disease that can affect humans and our pets,"" Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said in an official statement. ""New Yorkers should make sure their pets are up to date on rabies vaccinations and maintain distance from wildlife. If you see an animal you believe to be acting strangely, please call 311.""
Rabies affects the central nervous system, and while it is a fatal viral disease, it is preventable. In NYC, it is found mostly in raccoons, and for this reason it is crucial that residents and their pets refrain from getting close or touching the animals. As a further precaution, pets can also be vaccinated against the virus.
""While coming into contact with a rabid raccoon is very rare, raccoons are residents of our city, and New Yorkers should be advised,"" Sarah Aucoin, Chief of Education & Wildlife for NYC Parks, said in an official statement. ""If you see a raccoon, give them space, and never approach or try to feed them.""
For more information on rabies and what to do in case of an emergency, you can visit NYC's information page on the subject."
https://www.thrillist.com/lifestyle/new-york/deuxmoi-where-to-see-celebrities-in-nyc,Thrillist,"If you visit the ""about"" page on DeuxMoi.world, you will be met with a small block of text that reads, ""Thanks For Visiting The About Page. This Is About All We'll Say About Us."" What that ""about"" page gives us is pretty equal to what we know about the person behind the account—not much at all (unless you believe the internet rumors).
DeuxMoi originally started as an unsuspecting fashion blog in 2014 and an accompanying Instagram page. Although the blog went defunct, the Instagram page continued to be run by one of its original owners. In 2020 at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the account's owner asked her 45,000 followers for celebrity stories that they would be willing to share. What originated as an attempt to entertain herself quickly turned into an overnight sensation.
DeuxMoi began receiving and then anonymously posting direct messages with stories about A-listers from her followers. When celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, and David Beckham were name-dropped on the account, more and more people began to share their encounters with other stars. Two years later, now with over 1.6 million followers on Instagram, DeuxMoi has become one of the biggest sources of celebrity gossip, sightings, and stories. If a celebrity is spotted in the wild, chances are, DeuxMoi heard—and posted—about it first. Her weekly roundup of celebrity sightings, known as ""Sunday Spotted,"" is a consistent source of Hollywood news. Despite her popularity and much speculation around her identity, the woman behind the curtain remains a mystery. In rare interviews, like this one, she prefers to be referred to simply as DeuxMoi. She does not give any personal information about herself other than she lives in New York, but that tidbit does not seem to worry her since it’s pretty easy to remain anonymous in a city of eight million people.
While we may not know the name or face behind DeuxMoi, we soon will get to know more about her than ever before. On November 8, DeuxMoi will publish her first novel, Anon Pls., a fictionalized retelling of the account's story. The novel follows protagonist Cricket Lopez, an assistant to a high-profile celebrity stylist, after she turns her Instagram page into a source for celebrity gossip. What started as a drunken decision begins to take its toll on Cricket's real life. Celebrities begin hounding her for sharing their secrets, her boss is unhappy with her declining work ethic, and her friends feel sidelined by her social media presence. As her Instagram continues to grow, Cricket has to reckon with the fact that she, by proxy, is now famous—although no one knows it.
Anon Pls. may be fictional, but the places it mentions are not. For example, the famous The Bowery Hotel, a real-life celebrity hotspot, comes up in the book more than once. Although the other NYC haunts brought up in the novel are real, there is one spot in the book that DeuxMoi had to change the name of for legal reasons. But don't worry: She's certain that readers will know what the real location is, since she posts about it often.
Despite personally choosing to go to lesser known spots that wouldn't be classified as ""trendy,"" the types of places that may not make their way into Anon Pls., DeuxMoi's knowledge of where to find celebrities is boundless. DeuxMoi spoke to Thrillist about where to go if you want to spot a celebrity. And if you succeed, make sure to hit her DMs.
Celebrities happen to go to a lot of the same restaurants over and over—particularly celebs that don't live in New York. Whenever they come into town, the Kardashians for example, they'll always go to the same places. The flip side of that is maybe they know where to go to be seen. Carbone is an obvious example of a restaurant that celebrities always love to go to. The most underrated celebrity hangout spot is Supper. It's Italian on 156 East Second Street. Celebs have been seen there, but I just feel like it's not as well known as Don Angie and Carbone but also has really good Italian food.
I mean also Ray's, obviously. It's owned by Justin Theroux and Nicholas Braun is also a partner, so there's always celebs at Ray's. Zoë Kravitz loves Ray's. Anytime a celeb is in town, like Dua Lipa, they always stop by Ray's for a drink.
If you're in Manhattan and you're in Soho or if you're in the West Village, you have a better chance of spotting. NoHo, SoHo or the West Village, those are the best spots where you'll have the best chances of seeing celebs.
The Bowery Hotel, of course. Celebs love it. They'll hang out in the lobby. They'll hang out at the bar that people can walk off the street and go into. It's not super discreet. It's not a private club. I don't necessarily understand the allure of why it's still so popular.
I would also add Casa Cipriani, which you have to be a member of. The Ned is another one that celebs are at all the time, but you also need to be a member. The Mark Hotel, too, there's always celebs at the restaurant there as well.
I think Manhattan is better for celebrity spotting than Brooklyn because it's more condensed. But that's the only reason I think that. There are tons of celebs in Brooklyn. I think a lot of celebs live in Brooklyn, but things tend to be a little more spread out.
I think that the ""Sunday Spotted"" portion of my Instagram account has really helped me get ahead of the curve. For example, I started hearing about Laser Wolf in Brooklyn a couple of months ago and now I'm hearing about it a lot more. I would say that it's definitely an up-and-coming [celebrity hangout] spot.
A lot of people are going to Brooklyn more, which is good because I think Brooklyn actually has really good restaurants. There's the Italian restaurant that Pete Davidson loves where he took Kim Kardashian to last year, Lilia. And there's Cafe Mogador. It's a family-run Moroccan and Middle Eastern Restaurant. Those three places that I hadn't really ever heard of, I started getting celebrity sightings there a couple months before it started ramping up.
I think that if someone wants to spot a celebrity, they just really have to be alert and keep their eyes open because they're probably passing a celebrity on the street. Especially if you're in any of those neighborhoods that I named. If you've lived here your whole life and you've never seen a celeb, of course you have, but you just didn't notice.

With Rockefeller Center replacing its famous ice rink with a roller rink just in time for spring and roller disco parties blowing up in Brooklyn, roller skating has quickly become a city pastime. Now, the hobby is expanding even further east, with the TWA Hotel at John F. Kennedy International Airport opening a roller rink directly on the tarmac.
From April 15 through November of this year, the Roll-A-Rama at the Runway Rink is welcoming guests every Friday from 4–8 pm and Saturdays and Sundays from 12–8 pm (weather permitting). And if weekends don’t work, the rink is also available for event booking during the week.
Accompanied by retro music and immersed in TWA Hotel's '60s vibes, skating fans will be able to travel back in time next to real planes. They can even plan to catch one after their skating session ends, as the TSA allows travelers to carry roller skates in their carry-on and checked bags.
While skaters are welcome to bring their own gear, rentals are available (and included) with every 50-minute session. The adult price for a skating session is $20, while kids under 12 are charged $16. Admissions can only be paid by credit card and are on a first-come, first-serve basis. For more information, you can visit the TWA Hotel website."
https://www.theinfatuation.com/washington-dc/guides/black-owned-restaurants-washington-dc,Theinfatuation,"Chocolate City has a long history of Black folks in every quadrant—whether they’re from down the block, across the country, or around the world. And from the soul food to the Ethiopian, the rich flavors from across the diaspora show up and show out in the District. If you’re looking to mix up your usual rotation or just branching out into the greatest cuisines the city has to offer, here are our favorite Black-owned restaurants in DC.
The best barbecue doesn’t come out of swanky restaurants. DCity Smokehouse is a testament to the fact that sliding into the local spot to grab your smoked meat is the best way to go. The Bloomingdale restaurant serves up brisket, turkey, ribs, and more in a refurbished garage splattered in all things DC and HBCU. The smoked wings will burst in your mouth when you bite through the crispy skin—pair them with the tangy housemade barbecue sauce. Come here for a quick lunch or a fun group dinner where you share as much of the menu as your elastic pants will allow.
There are a number of spots that have taken the Black clubstaurant idea and run with it, but The Park on 14th paved the way and we like to give credit where credit is due. You aren’t going to get good food here (or at most clubstaurants), so put that out your mind. But you will have a good time, whether you show up for Happy Hour, brunch, or a late-night grinding session. The vibe is always different, depending on the time of day, day of the week, and which of the four floors you’re on. But if you and your people are looking for a fun time where you can soak up your alcohol with subpar soul food, you won’t miss at The Park.
Before setting up shop at Union Market, Puddin’ was a popular food stall on Capitol Hill where devout customers devoured things like chicken and beef sausage gumbo, oyster and catfish po’boys, and its signature dish, the Brown Butter Bourbon Bread Puddin’. The staff here will take the time to not only walk you through the menu, but also hand over free samples you’ll take a little too quickly. Regardless of what you order, you have to end your meal with the boozy bread pudding that (if requested) comes with a fat scoop of vanilla ice cream.
The most famous Black-owned restaurant in DC doesn’t make the best food in the city, but we never pass up the chance to grab a half-smoke at Ben's Chili Bowl anyways. Inside, you can scan through the photos of visitors from across the decades scattered around the restaurant that tell the history of both Ben's and ""Black Broadway."" Prepare to wait in line to get some food, which you can eat at the counter or, if you're lucky, at one of the few red booths. There are also some tables in the back that can seat bigger groups. Get the original chili half-smoke with all the fixings, and make sure you ask them to split it. It comes with ridged potato chips, but you can always swap for an order of fries instead.
Halfsmoke is a '90s DC kid’s dream, so take advantage of the opportunity to step back in time at this Shaw establishment with throwback board games, metal lunch boxes, and VHS tapes. Lounge on one of the futons as you dive into boozy milkshakes adorned with old favorites like candy necklaces. Try the Cinnamon Toast Crunch-coated french toast, which is the Saturday morning breakfast you didn’t know you were missing. While the all-day brunch is a fantastic touch, don’t skip the half-smokes. The Briggs & Co, which is covered in mustard slaw, crispy onions, and bacon bits, is the bougie little brother of the OG chili half smoke a few blocks away at Ben’s Chili Bowl. And we mean that in the best way.
Some nights at His & Hers in Woodridge, there’s a DJ spinning a set that will make you want to dance more than eat. Except the upscale American food is so damn good, you won’t be able to put it down. Everything on the menu is bomb, like the spinach and artichoke dip, fried cauliflower nuggets, and lamb chops. But if you’re really stuck, get the ragin’ cajun pasta and have them add all the proteins. Stay upstairs if you want a long bar and full fluorescents, or descend the staircase inscribed with “Da Butt” lyrics to find the second bar and some larger tables to post up.
Kitchen Cray on H Street is a multigenerational hot spot where you can woo your partner, get wild with your friends, or chill with momma—all in the same place, which makes up for the aight food. The American restaurant lives up to its name, so some of the menu items will have you tilting your head in both confusion and curiosity (like the burger topped with shrimp). Your eyes will follow every plate that passes the table and the buffalo sauce on the KC chicken sandwich assaults your nose in the best way. Unfortunately, the food doesn’t taste quite as good as it looks or smells, but it’s decent and the portions are huge. Quick warning: if the DJ is playing, be prepared to yell, but the jams are solid and everybody (including the DJ) is usually having a good time.
Ward 8 deserves all of the best things, and this restaurant is one of them. Kitchen Savages is all about the community, and brings a much-needed fancy spot east of the river, complete with black linen tablecloths, gold flatware, and comfortable blue velvet chairs. It’s a good pick for date night or just for a fun ‘round the way evening. From the signature Savage fries to the jerk lamb chops, you can taste the care that goes into every bite at this Anacostia soul food spot. We’re especially obsessed with the lobster mac and cheese that comes topped with a perfectly fried lobster tail. The drinks are simple, but we love that the Sweet Irene, a spin on the French martini, is an ode to the owner’s mother.
The Players Lounge in Congress Heights has been a community staple since the '70s and on any given night, you’ll find it packed with regulars enjoying the A1 soul food and family feel. It’s a step back in time, with stained-glass Michelob overhead lamps, wood paneled walls and an old-school cash register. You’ll find most folks packed into the bar area, but there’s also extra seating in the back. Wednesday night karaoke is a vibe, so be ready to chop it up, and if you know how to act, you’ll feel at home in no time. Grab some chicken wings with the greens and mac and cheese (and a strong-a*s drink that’ll have you under the table) and you’re in for a good time.
This upscale restaurant has been open since 1993 and combines luxury dining with classic southern cuisine. The restaurant aims to transport you to a New Orleans jazz club complete with a grand piano and arched windows. And although we’ve had better soul food, the meals here leave us satisfied. The catfish fingers, the fried green tomatoes, and the banana pudding are popular and worth the hype. If you’re looking for a classy night out and a classic meal to go with it, Georgia Brown’s is your spot.
With one of the largest Ethiopian communities in the country, great Ethiopian restaurants in the city are not in short supply. And some of the best DC has to offer can be found at Letena in Columbia Heights. When you order the vegetarian sampler, you get a beautifully plated meal full of vibrant vegetables that’ll have you thanking whatever higher power you believe in for bringing you this far. And it’s not just the food. The restaurant is painted in warm hues of orange with rustic lanterns and framed art pieces lining the walls. After a few cups of honey wine and an order of the silky tiramisu, you’ll leave feeling buzzed and blessed.
This West African take-out spot in Anacostia is run by a mother-and-son team who know their way around the kitchen. The jollof rice, which might be our favorite thing on the menu, is a perfect example. The rice is tender but still holds a bite thanks to the assortment of spices like red pepper, curry, and garlic powder. You can easily eat the jollof on its own, though we recommend the Ghanaian peanut soup made with peanut butter and a smoky tomato base that has us drooling just thinking about it. The service here is quick, though we recommend ordering ahead of time just in case. If you order ahead, you can go in and out in under 10 minutes flat.
Sometimes restaurants are time capsules that embody a city’s culture and legacy. Florida Avenue Grill is a DC institution that has served residents since 1944, and is also the city’s oldest Black-owned restaurant. It’s an old-school diner, so think tattered vinyl booths and bar seats that have withstood the test of time, and serves dishes like BBQ pork spare ribs and chitterlings to customers that range from longtime regulars to the occasional tourist.  For breakfast, their world-famous hot cakes, served with butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar, is the stuff of dreams. They're light and fluffy, buttery and sweet. Things take time here and the service can be slow, but like the saying goes, good things come to those who wait.
Swahili Village in Dupont Circle brings East and West Africa together over a scrumptious spread of food. The restaurant is a popular gathering spot for the who's who of Black DC. It's a great pick for birthday dinners and first dates since the restaurant boasts an assortment of seating options including spacious private rooms, and a roped-off balcony that works great for guests looking for something more intimate. The menu fuses classic African dishes and ingredients like jollof rice, sweet plantain, and goat stew to create a menu that’ll have you doing the Birdman hand rub while you wait. Our favorite dishes include the suya, grilled and charred beef cubes served with freshly diced onions and tomatoes. And the beef samosas come in a flaky filo dough with a sweet but fiery dipping sauce.
The first thing you see when you walk into Cane, a Trinidadian restaurant on H St., is a painting of President Obama eating some doubles. And the doubles at Cane, like the doubles in the painting are overflowing with curried chickpeas and spices. The menu, which pays homage to the island's Afro-Indian street food and other traditional Caribbean dishes, includes heavy hitters like oxtail and snapper escovitch. But if you’re going to try just one thing, get the jerk wings, which are smoked for three hours after sitting in a 24-hour marinade made with scotch bonnet peppers, cumin, and paprika. You'll eat them so fast, you’ll find yourself licking your fingers and wondering who ate the last one.
This take-out joint on H Street blends two of our favorite things: soul food and Ethiopian cuisine. The fried chicken is coated in a buttermilk marinade made with berbere, an Ethiopian spice blend that consists of chili peppers, coriander, garlic, and ginger. The result is crispy skin that turns this burgundy-caramel red and meat that’s packed with flavor. You can choose your spice level for most dishes, ranging from a mild “Naked” to “Burna Boy” hot. Weekends tend to get busy here and the restaurant doesn't offer indoor dining, so skip the long lines and order online beforehand.
Spicy Water African Grill brings Ivorian cuisine to DC in all its glory. The restaurant serves up peppery kebab sandwiches (chicken or beef), smoky charcoal-grilled chicken platters, and crispy fried red snapper with fresh onions and peppers. While you can get in and out in under 15 minutes for a quick dinner or lunch, the upstairs dining room is the best place to eat. There’s a hodgepodge of wooden tables and chairs occupied by mild-mannered uncles watching a 2022 Olympic basketball match between the USA and France on loop. It’s here, while cracking into sharply spiced crispy snapper tails and tearing into flaky pieces of chicken, that you’ll finally understand why your mama used to scold you for making it look like you weren’t being fed at home. Shoveling generous handfuls of fries drizzled with peppery tomato stew is worth every disapproving look.
Make your mornings extra special with breakfast at Heat Da Spot. The Ethiopian cafe in Petworth serves up homemade iced cinnamon honey lattes and scrumptious BECs. But it's their Ethio-platters, eggs paired with chechebsa, fried flatbread soaked in spiced butter and berbere, that steal the show. Weekends at the cafe are bustling as weekday takeout regulars kick back with friends, sipping blood orange iced teas on well-worn stools and plush couches. The cafe is a go-to spot for just about everyone in the neighborhood, including Howard students a few blocks down the street.

https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/the-office-of-mr-moto,Theinfatuation,"Mr. Moto was a gourmand and art connoisseur. In 1853, he accompanied Commodore Mathew Perry on a voyage to Japan. He took notes on gastronomy and collected artifacts. He also, definitely, did not exist.
The Office of Mr. Moto provides that elaborate backstory, and we get it. Every restaurant has a gimmick. At Sushi on Me, it’s chefs who tell you to “enjoy your fucking food,” and at Lilia, it’s agnolotti that occasionally sells out, despite no interruptions to the agnolotti supply chain.
The gimmick at this speakeasy-style East Village spot, hidden behind an unmarked entrance with a secret keypad, is more elaborate than most—but it doesn’t play a huge role in the actual dining experience. Once you settle in for your $195, 21-course meal, you’ll find that this is just a pleasant, friendly, upper-tier omakase place that provides good value and a few curveballs, the first of which is getting in the door.
Due to Mr. Moto’s size—a few tables and a short chef’s counter—and dedication to the bit, reservations are claimed as soon as they're released online. If you manage to snag one (your best bet is the waitlist), you’ll then need to decipher a cryptic email with a hidden passcode. Depending on how many seasons of Sherlock you've finished, this could take between one and five minutes.
The pageantry is fun, and it’s what sets this place apart, but once you listen to a host’s solemn recap of Mr. Moto’s life and achievements, the theater abruptly ends. After that, you’ll find yourself in a mellow little room with antique knickknacks and a twinkling soundtrack—compliments of a player piano hidden in a waiting room down below—as you begin a marathon of a meal with a few interesting highlights and enough sheer volume to guarantee a good time.
Slightly undersized and lightly dressed nigiri account for 15 of the 21 courses, and they’re what you’ll remember best. The fish here changes frequently, but you can expect a few uncommon finds, in addition to plenty of usual suspects. You’ll get your uni, toro, and torched kinmedai, but also things like fatty blackthroat seaperch and baby cuttlefish with a bouncy, creamy texture that you’ll chase for days afterward, chewing on gummy sharks and hair ties to recapture the feeling.
The staff will offer to add more rice to your pieces if you want more food, but that’s not how you want to fill up. Minimally seasoned and not quite warm, the rice is the weakest link of the meal.
If you obsess over little details like that, take your $195 elsewhere. Mr. Moto is a special-occasion restaurant for people who like dragging their friends to escape rooms just as much as they enjoy consuming caviar-topped tuna. The gimmick wears off quick, but that's probably for the best. Thinly sliced cuttlefish is significantly more compelling than any fictional backstory.
If you opt for the standard 21-course omakase (as opposed to the $225 Modernity Menu with ""modern and innovative flavors""), your meal will begin with a few small bites, such as salty, crunchy tempura-fried squid, and chawanmushi accessorized with shiso and uni. Next, you’ll get a piece of pressed sushi—good, but unimportant—followed by the main event: 15 pieces of nigiri made with whatever fish is currently on hand. Past selections have included red gurnard, kombu-cured fluke, vinegary gizzard shad, shima-aji with sour plum paste, and marshmallow-soft seared barracuda. Most pieces come dressed and seasoned, with plenty of yuzu in the mix. You’ll finish with a handroll, soup, and mochi ice cream."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/strand-book-store-nyc-new-coffee-shop,Thrillist,"New Yorkers will now be able to enjoy their bookstore strolls even more.
Strand Book Store, the famous and New York City-favorite independent bookstore, has just added an in-house coffee shop to its iconic Broadway store. The Strand opened its doors to caffeine fans on June 25, with the new coffee booth developed in partnership with the local Brooklyn Roasting Company.
""Bringing coffee to our customers has been a long-time dream for The Strand,"" Laura Ravo, the COO of Strand Books, told TimeOut New York. ""When we made the decision to add it to our store, we sought to bring customers the most authentic coffee experience and Brooklyn Roasting Company fit that vision perfectly.""
Customers will now be able to tour the many aisles of the store while sipping on a freshly-made drink. Drip coffee as well as espresso craft drinks will be available, and those looking for something else will be able to order chai and even matcha, or refresh their palates with iced blueberry or iced lemon espresso spritzers.
Whether you want to sit down and read your new book or are at The Strand just for a quick buy, the new coffee shop will be able to accommodate your preferences. Limited seating and to-stay mugs are available for those looking to wind down in-store, and to-go cups will be offered, too."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/popeyes-spicy-wicked-shrimp-added-to-menus,Thrillist,"While a bunch of otherfastfoodchains are introducing new and improved fried chicken sandwiches to catch up with Popeyes, it looks like the Louisiana-style chicken chain is sitting pretty, focusing on leveling up other parts of its menu. On Monday, Popeyes announced the debut of its all-new Wicked Shrimp—bite-sized fried shrimp featuring the heat of sriracha hot sauce.
Wicked Shrimp is officially hitting Popeyes' nationwide menu on November 2, but only for a little while. So... what makes the shrimp so wicked? We think it has something to do with the spicy heat. They shrimp are marinated in a blend of Louisiana-style herbs and spices, including salt, pepper, onion, garlic, cayenne pepper, bay leaf, and a touch of sriracha, according to a spokesperson for the chain. They're then battered and dusted with Popeyes' southern crispy coating for maximum crunch.
Popeyes is selling Wicked Shrimp as part of a meal, which comes with 14 pieces of shrimp, a regular side, a biscuit, and Smoky Garlic Tartar sauce for dipping on the side, for about $5. You can get it by order via the Popeyes mobile app for contactless delivery or for pickup at locations offering that as an option.
When Popeyes will turn its attention back to the now-reignited fried chicken sandwich war remains unclear. But when it does, maybe it'll finally unleash the BBQ sauce- and bacon-loaded chicken sandwich it recently tested in Denver at its locations nationwide. At least, one can hope so."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/immersive-artsdistrict-brooklyn-coming-soon,Thrillist,"Get ready to experience a sensory overload. The new immersive and experiential arts venue ArtsDistrict Brooklyn, also known as AD/BK, is opening in Greenpoint (25 Franklin Street) in July.
The huge 25,000 square feet space will redefine how guests experience both analog and digital art in all its form through visual and audio mediums, and it will feature a curated selection of content for visitors to enjoy.
The exhibits ""Flight"" and ""Séance"" are set to make their US debut at the new space, offering very intense and immersive experiences. Guests will experience an incredible mix of theater, technology, and sound—and they will do so in complete darkness inside 40-foot shipping containers.
The US premiere of ""Limitless AI""—a project signed by the creators of ""Poetic AI""—will also be part of the lineup, occupying 10,000 square feet with its immersive audiovisual experience.. It will consist of a 70-minute show that builds from ""Poetic AI"" and adds an intriguing narrative component. Using datasets ranging from Leonardo da Vinci's brushstroke technique to Galileo's physics textbooks, an artificial intelligence algorithm learned the characteristics of the works it was fed, and it created new artworks from scratch based on those sources.
Those looking to quench their thirst or grab a bite will be able to do so at an on-site café, where they'll also be able to wind down and scroll through their social media thanks to free WiFi. Guests who wish to hang out in the sun, instead, will be welcome to sit outside on the open-air patio with seating available.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/a-free-immersive-south-park-pop-up-experience-is-heading-to-nyc-072022,Timeout,"It will travel around the country inside a shipping container.
In celebration of South Park's 25th anniversary, Comedy Central has announced the launch of an immersive, traveling exhibit showcasing props, memorabilia, art work, collectables, scripts, storyboard concept art and more about the popular show. ""South Park: The 25th Anniversary Experience"" is set to kick off in New York's Union Square, this Saturday, July 23, from 10am to 6pm.
Created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, South Park is actually cable's longest-running scripted series, so do expect the celebration to match the enormity of the occasion.
The immersive exhibition will be housed inside a custom fabricated shipping container that is inspired by the South Park Studios storage unit where many of the items that will be on display in New York have been held for over two decades.
""The shipping container—which features a custom, Cartman-inspired paint job—will also serve as an interactive photo opp,"" reads an official press release, revealing that attendees will get to post alongside the show's characters against three different iconic South Park landscapes.
The free-to-attend pop-up will also serve as a point of purchase, so visitors will get to buy South Park merchandise, included limited-edition anniversary items specific to the city the exhibit will travel to.
After its stint in Union Square, the shipping container will head to Chicago, the Red Docks, Denver and Los Angeles.
Happy anniversary, Cartman, Kenny Stan, Kyle and company!"
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/the-first-ever-sweetgreen-on-long-island-is-now-officially-open-102022,Timeout,"Grab a salad or a cauliflower bowl in Garden City.
Believe it or not, despite operating over 180 locations nationwide, popular fast casual restaurant Sweetgreen had yet to open an outpost on Long Island. That has officially changed this week with the debut of Sweetgreen in Garden City, less than an hour drive away from midtown Manhattan, at 191 Seventh Street.
Menu staples will delight diners across the 2,600 square feet of space featuring a large interior dining area where up to 26 folks can sit down at once. The outdoor area can accommodate up to 18 patrons at any given time as well.
Perhaps most excitingly—in addition to the delicious food you can order on premise—is the decor of the space, which boasts an art series by specially-commissioned New York-based abstract artist and poet Amber Vittoria.
Standout food items include the guacamole greens salad with tortilla chips, roasted chicken, shredded cabbage and red onion; the shroomami bowl with shredded kale, warm wild rice, basil, cucumber, raw beet, roasted mushroom and warm portobello mix; and the hot honey chicken plate with warm quinoa, toasted almonds, hot roasted sweet potatoes and hot honey sauce.
The fall seasonal menu is also available already, featuring a curry cauliflower dish with warm quinoa, arugula, cilantro, shredded cabbage, raisins, blackened chicken, curry roasted cauliflower and peppercorn tahina dressing and the buffalo cauliflower with crispy rice, Caesar dressing and Sweetgreen's own famous hot sauce, among other entries.
Long Islanders will be happy to know that the chain has also signed leases for spaces in Woodbury and in Manhasset. According to Long Island Business Week, they're also ""working on several other locations in the area.""

https://www.theinfatuation.com/los-angeles/guides/the-meet-in-the-middle-bar-guide-where-to-drink-when-youre-coming-from-opposite-sides-of-town,Theinfatuation,"Studies show the average person will spend two years of their life waiting in line, nine years surfing the internet, and 13 years listening to music. And if you live in Los Angeles, you spend the rest of your life figuring out where to meet people halfway for dinner.
In a city this size, agreeing on a fair middle point is a way of life. Your friend’s coming from Koreatown, but you just got out of a 5pm in Brentwood, and neither one of you wants to cross La Cienega. It’s a game of give-and-take that only really leads to one thing: wasted time. So we made a guide to help. Here are 10 places to eat when you’re coming from opposite sides of town.
Located on the ground floor of the Hollywood Historic Hotel, The Edmon is one of the best bars in LA that you probably haven’t been to yet. Its Melrose and Wilton location is definitely closer to Hollywood than downtown, but it’s also right off the Melrose/101 exit, so it’s convenient for both parties. The massive bar has an aggressive art deco interior in an exciting way that makes you feel like a rich person from the 1920s. They have great cocktails, solid bar food if you get hungry, and you never have to fight for a seat at the bar.
Wellesbourne is a neighborhood English pub on Pico right across the street from the Westside Pavilion. The place goes all-in on the cheesy British aesthetic (there’s a library room with old books that you can actually read), which can be overlooked because the drinks are affordable ($5 draft beer during 5-7pm Happy Hour) and whoever’s coming from West Hollywood won’t technically have to cross the 405.
The San Fernando sits on an industrial stretch of western Glendale that, unless you’ve been to Moonlight Railway, you probably didn’t even know existed. The neighborhood spot sits right across the street from a commuter rail line and has the train station-themed aesthetic to go along with it. But nothing about the place feels cheesy. The cocktails are affordable and well-made, the bartenders will actually talk to you, and there’s a small stage in the back with nightly live performances.
Alibi Room has been around for a few years now, and is still one of the more dependable spots on the Westside for a quick drink. Located in Culver City west of the 405, Alibi Room is easy to get into, has over 30 rotating beers, and is the only place you can get Kogi tacos outside of the main Kogi Taqueria or from one of the trucks. If drinks end up getting pushed till after dinner, there’s also a late-night Happy Hour starting at 11pm with several different drink specials.
Due to its industrial location that can best be described as “right by the 10 Freeway,” the Mandrake is one of the most overlooked bars in the city. The casual interior has a long bar that’s never crowded, plus a separate room in the back with big booths in case this is one of those friend meet-ups where you both lay horizontally and pout about your relationships. The cocktails are good (the horseradish-infused Mandrake Mary is always our order) and there’s a daily 5-8pm Happy Hour.
Even if it’s 85 degrees outside, sometimes you just need to pretend you’re in a ski lodge in Canada for the night. Go to Bigfoot Lodge West. Located on Venice Blvd. in Culver City, Bigfoot Lodge has an aggressive woodsy aesthetic, but not in the way that’ll make you feel like you’re on Splash Mountain. The crowd is local and low-key, there’s usually live music of some sort, and there’s a daily Happy Hour that goes from 5-9pm.
Because the majority of movie studios are in Burbank and the talent agencies are in Beverly Hills, there are very few trails in LA as well-worn as this one. And that typically puts the mid-way bullseye somewhere around Hollywood. While there are plenty of places to drink here, Cat and The Fiddle is our favorite for when you just need to grab a couple drinks on a Tuesday. The British bar has a casual space that never gets too crowded, a relatively easy parking situation, and a daily Happy Hour from 4-7pm that gets you $5 beer, wine, well drinks, Old Fashioneds, and Pimm’s Cups.
A neighborhood bar with cocktails worth driving across the city for.
Sassafras in Hollywood has fantastic cocktails, live music, and a very aggressive Old South vibe.
Saint Felix is one of the rare chill options to grab a drink and some food in boystown.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/a-pop-up-diner-managed-by-karens-is-opening-in-nyc-this-march-122922,Timeout,"The Karens will be just as rude as their namesake.
We personally find the Karen phenomenon to have run its course but, alas, there seems to still be some fodder behind the trend. Starting March 1, 2023, a new roving pop-up dubbed Karen's Diner is opening in the West Village.
Already operating across 14 different cities in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, the diner will be managed by, you guessed it, a bunch of Karens and it will stay put through the very end of next year.
According to the official website, folks can expect ""an absurd, unique environment full of laughs, banter and top-notch American-diner style grub."" Perhaps most importantly, the business warns that the ""food is great [and] the service is ungrateful. But your experience will be unforgettable."" You see what they're going for here.
Food-wise, there are a bunch of burgers on the menu, including The ""I Want to See the Manager"" Karen (two Wagyu patties, two slices of Swiss cheese, bacon, lettuce, pickles and BBQ-mustard sauce), the vegan Trippy Karen Burger (portobello mushroom, tasty cheese, lettuce, tomato and relished mustard sauce) and, of course, the Basic Karen (Wagyu beef with Swiss cheese, tomato, oak, lettuce, beetroot and garlic mayo).
There are also two types of hot dogs on offer, a variety of sides (halloumi fries with sweet chili sauce, loaded cheesy beef brisket, mozzarella sticks with sweet chili sauce and beer-battered onion rings, among other options) and a number of desserts, including a waffle bowl and a churro delight.
To help you deal with the sub-par staff, make sure to order some beer and wine as well.
A bit more about the experience: you'll want to book your visit ahead of time right here (tickets will cost you $35), dietary restrictions are catered to and, although kids are allowed inside, the various Karens suggest you bring the little ones in before 5pm “and keep them under control.” Fair warning: “If one starts screeching, manage the noise or leave.”  Word to the wise: keep the children at home—and perhaps just stay home with them?"
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/nyc-rent-prices-are-finally-going-down-102822,Timeout,"A bit of good news before the weekend.
The trend is still a very slow one, but it's clearly happening: rent prices all across New York City are finally going down. It's been a long road, we know.
Two different recent studies suggest that the local real estate market is (finally!) cooling off. First off, a report from the Real Deal points to numbers that indicate that the national median rent for one bedrooms has decreased by .07% in the last month and by .8% when looking at two-bedroom apartments.
Even more specifically, apartment rental website Zumper noticed a 2.3% drop in median NYC rent prices between September and October of this year.
Yes, the changes are pretty minimal but, given the sorts of increases that city dwellers have been contending with since last summer, any sign of a cool-down is greatly appreciated.
What's more, while chatting with Curbed, appraiser Jonathan Miller noted that the shifts might lead to the end of the bidding wars that have characterized the market in recent months. ""[Renters] might once again be able to score a concession on a luxury apartment that's a hike to the subway and costs more than $5,000 a month,"" reads a report by the outlet.
As New Yorkers not-so-fondly remember, this past July, the average Manhattan rent was $5,000 for the very first time ever on record. In addition to that, the Rent Guidelines Board voted to raise prices in rent-stabilized homes across town on all leases starting October 1, 2022 or later. Approximately two million New Yorkers were directly affected by the decision.
We've got a long road ahead of us but this bit of good news has got given us a bit of much-needed hope."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/rockaway-rocket-ferry-manhattan-rockaway-beach,Thrillist,"The sole thought of a long and sweaty subway ride or a never-ending ferry line on the way to Rockaway Beach can make your skin crawl, but luckily there is now a fresher (and more scenic) option available.
This summer, starting on July 23 and through September 11, New Yorkers will be able reserve a seat on a nonstop ferry ride to the Rockaways and back. The service will be available every Saturday, Sunday, and holiday through the end of the summer.
Hopping aboard is simple. Riders looking to bypass the subway to the beach only need to reserve their ride on the Rockaway Rocket ferry, which departs from Manhattan's Pier 11 by Wall Street and stops only at Rockaway Beach 108th Street at Beach Channel Drive. This differs from the ferry's typical Rockaway Beach service, which also stops at Brooklyn's Sunset Park and doesn't take reservations, leading to long lines in the summer.
The service is available at select times. Departures from Manhattan are scheduled at 9:30 am, 11:30 am and 1:30 pm, while riders can depart from Rockaway at 2:30 pm, 4:30 pm and 6:30 pm. The cost for each way is $8, and it only includes the Rockaway Rocket ferry ticket. If you want to transfer to another ferry, you'll need to pay an extra $2.75. A roundtrip fare on the Rockaway Rocket will cost each passenger $16.
Before you head to the Rockaways, though, make sure to check both the heat and weather alerts and the beach closings. Recently, Long Island beaches were closed due to increasing shark attacks (six in the last three weeks), so make sure you know ahead of time if your destination is open to the public. And be careful in the water!"

Its “Summer for the City” festival will be back on June 14 through August 12 with hundreds of free events, from silent discos and outdoor film screenings to queer music festivals and orchestra performances, and more.
For the first time, the performing arts center’s campus will also be completely transformed by Visual Designer Clint Ramos, who is planning a greenhouse treat, a new performance space, and fun decorative details around Hearst Plaza, among other things.
The city’s largest outdoor dance floor with a massive, 10-foot-wide disco ball—The Dance Floor at Josie Robertson Plaza—will return for social dance nights, silent discos, and more giant parties.
The Garden will be a greenhouse-like oasis for gathering with greenery designed in collaboration with Donyale Werle Design.
Hearst Plaza, which will be decorated with bright, neon lights, will be full of outdoor games, a new performance space, and al fresco dining and drink options from Lincoln Ristorante, Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi, and nearby food trucks. All of this will be surrounded by 200 faux flamingos hanging out in the Paul Milstein Reflecting Pool.
On the western façade of the David H Koch Theater, the phrase “Y fui toda en mí como fue en mí la vida” (“And I was all in me as was life in me” from Julia de Burgos’ poem “Yo Misma Fui Mi Ruta (I Was My Own Path)”, will welcome visitors as vinyl botanicals adorn walkways and other building fronts.

And since phantom trains clank across the rails from Stockholm to St. Louis, it's probably time you consider buying a ticket for a frightful ride to remember—besides your usual subway commute.
That's where the New Hope Railroad comes in: The Pennsylvania rail company is changing up its usual October haunted train ride offering this year, to launch an entirely new experience called No Hope After Dark, which will last for more than 100 minutes and include a brand new scare maze.
""The night isn't solely about screams and shivers,"" the website states. ""Many nights beckon with food trucks offering a delicious escape from the fright and live music casting enchanting tunes under the moonlit sky, bringing a lively respite for the brave at heart.""
The historic train departs under the cover of darkness from New Hope, Pennsylvania, and snakes its way through an eerie stretch of railroad that drifts through the woods toward the festival site dubbed ""the realm of the unknown."" Some nights, the festival will include food trucks. However, meal service won't be available on the train.
It's recommended that only adults venture out to the ghost train, but steel-nerved teenagers are welcome to scrap with the ghouls as well. The excursion is open to anyone who is aged 13 or older.
The train has first and coach class seats available. Tickets will start at $53 for coach seats, and will go up to $79 for first class seats. New Hope recommends booking your tickets in advance online at NewHopeRailRoad.com.
Rides on the train start on Friday, October 6 and run through Halloween. The train will run every Friday through Sunday throughout the month, with occasional Wednesday and Thursday dates. There will be added dates Monday, October 30, and Tuesday, October 31.
Some coach reservations have already sold out, so you'll want to book your tickets soon if you plan on riding this haunted train. And make sure to arrive 20 minutes prior to departure, as ghosts wait for no man, woman or child over the age of 13.
As willfully subjecting yourself to horror is not a natural course of action for everyone, you can always look take the railroad's entirely wholesome and not-at-all-scary Fall Excursion, which is a two-hour roundtrip journey through Pennsylvania foliage."

On and around the recently honored stretch of McDonald Avenue, the community thrives with Bangladeshi cafes and restaurants, which contribute to the neighborhood's culture and livelihood.
Council Member Shahana Hanif, who unveiled the new street sign together with the leaders from the local Bangladeshi community, is thrilled to further represent the community and its importance in the neighborhood. Hanif initially proposed co-naming the section of McDonald Avenue back in April, and on October 16, the sign was finally unveiled.
""It signifies our presence and power in this City—we are the fastest growing Asian community and we are a visible face that New Yorkers interact with every single day,"" Hanif wrote on an Instagram post after the ceremony.

Only in a post-apocalyptic vision of unending late capitalism like that of Blade Runner or Judge Dredd would entertainment and advertising merge so seamlessly. Yet, that's what is happening (not for the first time), and the merger here is fast food and one of those fictional dark visions of the future. It's wrinkling brains.
The new Colonel Sanders at KFC is RoboCop. (It's the original and not the sleek version from the 2014 reboot with Joel Kinnaman.) The fried chicken purveyor announced the robo-news February 21, saying, ""He once protected the streets of Detroit. Now he’s protecting KFC’s Secret Recipe. Meet Colonel RoboCop.""
String bow ties meet justice in new commercials featuring the 80s sci-fi icon. The chicken chain is putting a little narrative into the tie-in, saying RoboCop is protecting the Colonel's secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, even making reference to RoboCop's prime directive. Starting February 24, Chew Boom reports, RoboCop will appear in a series of new commercials. So, this isn't going to be a one-time thing.
The promo is taking place because the chain is apparently moving their secret recipe to Bahnhof's Pionen data center in Sweden. It's one of the most secure underground bunkers in the world, crafted to withstand a nuclear attack.
At this point, you should have accepted that nothing from your childhood is sacred. RoboCop could be the star of the inevitable Harry Potter reboot. But take heart from this, because it turns out some things are still sacred. Like the KFC recipe."

Brooklynites now have even more space to stretch out—50 Kent at Bushwick Inlet Park has officially opened to the public.
The 1.89-acre, waterfront green space, with $7.5 million in mayoral funding, includes smooth paths, a forest grove, an elevated lawn, a water feature, a family gathering area, an overlook and a plaza with sweeping views of Manhattan, all set between North 11th and 12th streets in Williamsburg.
It sits just north of Martha P. Johnson State Park.
The new space was originally a pop-up park that had only been open on the weekends but, after a year of design and construction, 50 Kent is full of stone and bench seating, thousands of plantings, including young canopy and understory trees, vibrant flowering plants, ornamental grasses and shrubs that support pollinators, birds and create shade.
The addition of this parcel to Bushwick Inlet Park means that when work is completed at BIP, it will span from North 9th Street to Quay Street for a total of more than 25 acres.
The Friends of Bushwick Inlet Park says it intends to serve all of North Brooklyn regardless of geographic hurdles imposed by redlining and the BQE.
""To counter these geographic hurdles, we are aiming to create a welcoming program that will be inclusive and attract our neighbors from the SouthSide of Williamsburg and other New Yorkers by forging intentional partnerships to support these goals,"" it says in a statement. ""Our vision in hosting these concerts is to connect the people from our fractured neighborhoods through cultural sharing, raise visibility and awareness of Bushwick Inlet Park while promoting and employing musicians and providing a venue for the appreciation for jazz, Latin and folk music.""

https://www.eater.com/2018/11/8/18072832/anthony-bourdain-parts-unknown-series-finale-lower-east-side-preview,Eater,"The last episode of Parts Unknown will air this Sunday, November 11, at 9 p.m. ET/PT, five months and three days after host Anthony Bourdain’s death. The series finale, set on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, closes the book on an era of Bourdain-hosted television that spanned 16 years, four series, and three networks. In this episode, which was filmed a couple of months before Bourdain died, viewers will get a tour of the chef-turned-television host’s old stomping grounds and interviews with icons of a time that, as Bourdain often lamented on camera, has passed.
No fewer than 15 individuals who gained notoriety during Bourdain’s youth are featured throughout the finale: musicians, actors, artists, filmmakers, and photographers. There’s Harley Flanagan, who was a drummer for the Stimulators at age 12 and co-founded the Cro-Mags when he was 14. Fab Five Freddy can be credited with introducing the world to hip-hop. Debbie Harry and Chris Stein, founders of Blondie, were among the first regulars at CBGB and made one of the most commercially successful acts to come out of the punk and new-wave scene. Clayton Patterson used his camera to document that part of the city and was on the ground during the Tompkins Square Park riot, a clash between squatters and police officers, the result of which, in Patterson’s mind, was the creation of America’s modern police state and New York City’s gentrification.
While all of this was going on, Bourdain was catching rock shows and shooting heroin. In one scene, he looks over an old collection of dope bags belonging to Patterson as one might reminisce over a school yearbook.
It’s hard to imagine there will ever be another television host quite like Bourdain, who went to places and met people most food and travel shows had no interest in knowing, or another period quite like the Lower East Side’s burned-out years. Chatting over boiled eggs in the episode’s final scene, John Lurie, the painter and saxophonist, considers whether there is any danger in over-romanticizing the latter.
“I’m sure glad I didn’t miss it,” he says."

Helmed by chef-owner René Redzepi, Noma is coveted for its modern Scandinavian fare that centres on sustainable, locally-sourced ingredients. It was ranked first in the 2021 World’s 50 Best Restaurants list.
Redzepi is sparing no effort for this upcoming residence in Kyoto, which has been in the making for over two years. In addition to the staff members that have been on ground since late spring, the award-winning chef is set to bring his entire staff and their families – 95 people in total – to Japan after closing Noma Copenhagen on February 18 2023. This is not Noma’s first time in Japan. In early 2015, the restaurant partnered with the Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo for a two-month pop-up that featured a tasting menu for ¥39,000 a head.
Noma Kyoto will run from March 15 to May 20 2023, offering lunch and dinner services from Wednesday through Saturday each week. According to the restaurant, the menu and concept of Noma Kyoto will explore the roots of Western tasting menus and highlight local produce that is harvested during the cherry blossom season.
The entire meal comes at a hefty sum of roughly ¥125,000 (€775 plus 10 percent service charge) per person, which includes beverage pairing and tea or coffee, but the eye-watering price tag hasn’t put off fine dining lovers. On the contrary, all tables for Noma Kyoto were filled mere minutes after the online booking system opened.
While reservations are no longer available, foodies vying for a seat at this coveted event can still join the waitlist for a chance to nab the next possible opening. See here for more details.

https://www.thrillist.com/lifestyle/new-york/immersive-dinner-and-a-movie-experience-fork-n-film-comes-to-new-york,Thrillist,"There may be no single word with more cultural cache right now than the word “immersive,” an aspirational concept for every kind of experience from art galleries to live sports. Maybe it’s a post-pandemic, pre-apocalypse crisis of the collective soul, or maybe it’s an earnest attempt to reconnect with three dimensional public space. Either way, immersive events are all the rage, and Fork n’ Film is coming to New York City to prove it.
The event series has been a huge hit in their original home of LA, and they’re about to make their Big Apple debut in September with the same concept: tying dinner and a movie together into one magical night out.
The idea is simple, ingenious in the way, that everything successful seems simple once it’s already popular. Guests arrive for a movie screening, settling in to a table instead of a row of seats. The film begins, and as key events happen on screen, the team at Fork n’ Film delivers a coursed-out series of fun and interactive dishes inspired by and timed up with the action.
Hagrid brings Harry Potter an iconic birthday cake in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, and all of a sudden a perfect replica lands in front of you, too. Remy the rat makes potato leek soup in Ratatouille, and you are delivered a little pot of broth with fistfuls of herbs and spices to drop in yourself at the same time. Dishes are playful and creative, with lots of flash and smoke, trickery and whimsical touches like edible paper or a dish served with a lit sparkler.
The immersive dinner experience comes from Nick Houston and Francesca Duncan, two creative types—Duncan is a singer-songwriter and Houston is a writer—who love food and movies, and who share an entrepreneurial spirit. The couple had been looking to make a professional move into the food world in one way or another, toying with a few different projects, and the vision for this one was totally clear to them both. There was a logical, actionable path forward: find a venue, put on a movie, serve dinner. So they tried it out, hopeful but not exactly expecting it to blow up—but blow up it did.
Thanks to the clever concept and some savvy choices, like picking iconic movies and creating fun and photogenic dishes that are particularly appealing to an online audience, Fork n’ Film was an instant hit on social media. Posts featuring the experience got millions of views, and all of a sudden they were selling out every date within minutes of going on sale. Celebrities like Keke Palmer, Dane Cook, and Kristen Bell started coming through, and it grew into a certified hit almost overnight.
“We literally thought that it was just going to be our friends and our parents,” Houston says. But it’s been way, way bigger than that. And there’s a lot more in store for them, too.
First on the agenda is the new soon-to-be-announced NYC location. Tickets will go on sale September 1, and the experience will debut September 29 and run through the holidays, with more dates added and tickets released over time. It may seem like a big jump, but it’s a homecoming for the NYC native Duncan, a special chance for her to bring a passion project back across the country.
It’s been a tough ticket to get, but if you’re able to snag some seats you’re in for a treat. The NYC run will debut with a fresh round of perfectly on-brand movie choices: Hocus Pocus for Halloween, then The Nightmare Before Christmas, Elf, and The Polar Express through the holiday season.
But it’s very real, and there’s a lot more to come. They’re also in the early stages of development on partnerships with major media companies, which could include things like official toys or merchandise as a ‘course’ of the event, or closer collaboration with the filmmakers and producers. But whatever they do, it will be centered on great food, and infused with the magic of the movies."

The treats are a nod to New Orleans, where the chain was founded, Popeyes told Foodbeast back in late September.
Currently, the only permanent dessert on Popeyes’ nationwide menu is cinnamon apple pie, although some locations may offer different items regionally.

If you’re a fan, you might remember that NYC restaurants were practically a fifth main character on the original show—with pivotal scenes taking place inside actual hot spots of the time (although some had made up names like Denial, Balzac, and Raw). So we couldn’t help but wonder: how many of the real-life restaurants seen on the show are still open today? Below is a list of still-standing SATC filming locations to get hyped for the relaunch (cosmos not included)."
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/this-mouthwatering-new-exhibit-at-new-york-historical-society-celebrates-jewish-deli-culture-111022,Timeout,"See a miniature Katz's Deli, outfits from ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" and lots of vintage NYC ephemera.
Warning: You’re bound to feel hungry after exploring this new exhibit at New-York Historical Society Museum & Library all about Jewish deli culture. Pastrami sandwiches, knishes, bagels, pickles and babka all get their due in “I'll Have What She's Having: The Jewish Deli,"" a show that's both delightfully fun and deeply meaningful.
The exhibition examines the important role of the Jewish deli through the immigrant experience, during World War II, as a refuge for Holocaust survivors, in pop culture and today. It's on view November 11 through April 2, 2023 at the historical society on the Upper West Side.
Here are seven things not to miss.
It's the New-York Historical Society, after all, so history underpins every part of the exhibit. The story begins between 1880 and 1924 when more than 2 million Jewish immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe made new homes in the United States. Many immigrants supported their families by selling food on city streets often from wooden pushcarts and barrels. Some of those blossomed into delicatessens, which began serving foods like pickles, knishes, gefilte fish, borscht and rugelach.
""The Jewish deli brings together foods from a huge geographic stretch under one roof in the immigrant context,"" said Lara Rabinovitch, a renowned writer, producer and specialist in immigrant food cultures who co-curated the exhibit for Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles where it debuted.
Over the years, the deli served as a lifeline for many of the 4,000 Holocaust survivors and refugees who came to the U.S. The deli provided a livelihood, as well as a space for community.
By the time the late 20th century arrived, as some delis closed, other artisanal deli options arrived often reimagining the classic menu items.
""Deli is a story of tradition and change, adaptation and resilience,"" Rabinovitch said.
To this day, Katz's Deli displays a sign reading ""Send a salami to your boy in the Army,"" and if you ever wondered about the history of that, here's the background. Delis and kosher butcher shops heavily promoted the idea of sending kosher hard salami to Jewish service members during WWII.
The exhibit even includes a letter from a service member who enjoyed the gift from home. In April 1944, he wrote, ""I had some tasty Jewish dishes just like home. My mother sent me a salami. ... the taste still remains in my mouth.""
A pink neon sign, an antique cigarette machine, a vintage clock, old menus and ads fill the space, each one transportive to another era.
""This is a trip down memory lane for sure,"" Louise Mirrer, president and CEO of New-York Historical Society, said. ""A testament to the power of food to evoke memories.""
From a cool digital interactive where you can build your own deli sandwich to a collection of food-themed props, you can have some fun with food.
""Food is a wonderful vehicle for cultural exchange,"" co-curator Laura Mart said. ""The deli is a community based on food where everybody is welcome.""
The deli plays a big role in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. The exhibit features a dress worn by Midge Maisel during a scene at the Stage Deli, as well as a costume worn by Verla, a waitress at the deli. During the show’s scenes at the deli, Midge connects with booking agents while classic deli dishes like the Reuben sandwich, matzo ball soup and knishes get some screen time, too.
A teeny tiny version of Katz's Delicatessen depicts the deli just after the hubbub of another busy day. Peek inside to see a ""Closed"" sign, tables ready for busing and a broom in the entrance. Brooklyn-born miniature artist Alan Wolfson created the scene of the beloved Lower East Side deli.
""We’re part of such a specific food tradition but something that is universally eaten and enjoyed,"" Katz's Deli owner Jake Dell said.
From “Mad Men” to “Seinfeld,” the Jewish deli has made a popular setting on screen. But there’s perhaps no scene more iconic than the hilarious moment in Katz’s Deli during When Harry Met Sally about “faking it.” Meg Ryan’s, ahem, performance is so captivating, the whole deli falls into silence and a woman at the next table says, “I’ll have what she’s having,” inspiring the title for the show. That clip and several other deli scenes play on a loop at the exhibit, and it’s impossible not to stop and watch.
Why does the deli feature so prominently on the screen?
Mart believes it’s because scenes in a deli can explore Jewish culture in a non-religious way. “It’s often been said the deli is a secular synagogue,” she said."

Starting May 14, ""Life of a Neuron"" will guide guests into the ""thinking cell"" of the brain. Upon walking into the exhibit, attendees will find themselves in a real-life 3D model of a human prefrontal cortex neuron, and will be able to learn about its life cycle, from birth to death.
""What's fascinating and revolutionary about the narrative we are telling with this groundbreaking collaboration through 'Life of a Neuron,' is the ability to have the audience experience something that is happening inside all of us by using the latest technical tools,"" Artechouse Founder & Chief Creative Officer Sandro Kereselidze said in a statement. ""It's an incredible opportunity to experience the science that we have been studying for the past 50 years in a new artistic way that speaks to the human experience.""
Featuring installations from multidisciplinary artists from around the world like Synthestruct, Akiko Yamashita, fuse*, Gil Castro, and Server Demirtas, the exhibit is a result of three years of work and collaboration between Artechouse and the Society for Neuroscience (SfN). Specifically, the main installation features technology-driven interactive artworks, and it explores vision, stress, addiction, and the neural connectivity from the perspective of a neuron. Bringing together decades of research and data in the field, it explores one of the defining pillars of human experience while educating guests through gorgeous artistic installations. In addition, it celebrates the 50th anniversary of SfN.
""What I find so exciting about this exhibit is that it is the first of its kind to use data like this to bring key neuroscience principles to life,"" lead neuroscientist for 'Life of a Neuron,' PhD, UC Davis Distinguished Professor John Morrison, said in a statement. ""Through the work of an incredible group of scientists organized by SfN, collaborating alongside the exciting group of artists organized by Artechouse, we're able to bring to the world an exhibit like no other—artistic interpretations of scientific data and principles that allow the public to experience neuroscience in a whole new way. It is my hope that this exhibit will spark curiosity in those who see it and inspire them to learn more about the universe between their ears.""

https://www.timeout.com/kuala-lumpur/restaurants/authenticity-in-food-what-defines-it-and-does-it-matter,Timeout,"In Malaysia, if a restaurant had a particularly elderly woman cooking the food of her homeland, it’s ‘confirm authentic one’. In a land of such rich and varied food, us Malaysians have been tuned to use authenticity as a measure to filter out the bad apples from the rest. But in 2016, after decades of cross-culture, is it still relevant?
The etymology of the term ‘authentic’ is Greek, from the word ‘authentikos’ meaning ‘genuine’. Therein lies the problem with the term when used in the context of cuisine. While it can be used to determine the authenticity of an iconic painting, a Prada bag or Microsoft Word software, using it to describe a bowl of noodles is suggesting that authenticity of a particular cuisine is absolute. It’s implying that a bowl of noodles should have just as much an indication of whether ‘it’s the real deal’ as a computer software. It’s brushing that bowl of noodles with two broad strokes of colour: black and white.  I’m of the belief that we foster feelings about a particular cuisine or dish based on memory. My grandmother’s honey fried chicken is a revelation – its thickset legs that sit in yoghurt for two nights, its skin black and bumpy from the sizzling wok, its crunchy bits and knobs gathered in a mouthful with rice and rasam. How could a dish that has never seen a day in my grandmother’s homeland come to be the dish I best associate her with? Even science will skew to the fact that my grandmother is just a fantastic cook, if not necessarily a ‘textbook’ one.  Another example is one of the best things I once ate in Tokyo, at an izakaya whose food is modern and playful, a far cry from the precision of the city’s fine kaiseki restaurants. The dish was tofu in the consistency of cream cheese, drizzled with honey, and spreadable on baguette. Maybe it was the company, the bottle of saké I was swiftly getting through, or the chef taking a fondness to us, but it struck me as one of the most inexplicably delicious things I had ever eaten. But was it authentic? Hardly.  If authenticity had a place in food culture, the result is the disaster that has taken place in Penang: xenophobia. In 2014, the state government announced a ban on foreign cooks to preserve and protect the ‘authenticity’ of street food. Early this year, the government implemented a move for vendors to display a ‘Penang Street Food’ sticker on their stalls if a local prepared the food. According to a survey conducted by the government, approximately 87 percent of respondents supported the move. Illustration: Sio Yean In an excuse to ‘protect’ a cuisine, the Penang government has fantastically but subtly managed to wipe out the idea of foreigners ‘touching our food’. It’s racism packaged as nationalism. It’s like telling David Thompson – the Australian chef based in Bangkok who drove Nahm to become one of the best Thai restaurants in the world – to piss off because the locals ‘do it better’. It’s the very dangerous idea of a cuisine belonging to one culture, one race, or one shade of skin; or the outdated notion that food is a product of nature, but never of nurture.  In the present day, the limiting concept of food protectionism is not just in Malaysia, it’s everywhere. But perhaps the biggest culprit of them all is Italy. No doubt a land of a rich, complex cuisine, Italy and its people can also be worryingly shielding of their cuisine. Change is often perceived as disrupting or disrespectful, a mindset that has compromised their hold on the World’s Best Restaurants list. The Italian most present in the list, Massimo Bottura, took many years to earn so much as a second glance from the people of Modena. His food at Osteria Francescana reimagines Italian classics with a new eye, with a fresh approach to lasagna or a lemon tart. But out of sheer conservatism, the Modenese would have nothing of it.  The same arrogance is displayed in Verona, where the mayor recently introduced a ban on mostly ‘ethnic’ and deep-fried food at immigrant-run businesses to preserve the ‘historic and architectural patrimony of the city’. The law was implemented after a spike in the number of kebab shops in the city. In an interview with Russia Today, Arzu Merali, director of Research at the Islamic Human Rights Commission, said that the ban was a pattern of systemic racism and Islamophobia across Europe. She adds, ‘It’s much easier now to have policies which are openly racist, and to dress them up very lightly with things like “keeping traditional character”.’ On another pressing note, how could one deny the need of kebab in one’s life?  A faltering issue with authenticity is also its refusal to acknowledge the fuse of two or more cultures. History has seen mass migration from one culture into another, and progress of a cuisine or the creation of a new one is an exciting result of it. Malaysian-Indian, Peruvian-Japanese and American-Chinese food are some examples that stray from the scholarly definition of authentic, but have been culturally appropriated to become cuisines of their own. But if a host country finds it difficult to embrace the food of an ‘outsider’, it can be perceived as an unwelcome jab at their subculture and its people. It’s a take of ‘my family is better than yours’.
It’s another thing altogether to protect food within the places they originate. Items like Camembert and champagne are put under strict European Union guidelines to protect their designation of origin. In Spain, high-quality food like jamónibérico, sherry and honey are isolated under a classification system called Denominación de Origen (DO) to regulate its quality and geographical origin. So long as the people producing the food are not shaming or limiting outside cultures for helping the cause, these certifications do little harm. It’s far less detrimental to protect the origin of food than to ban the ‘type of foreigners’ producing and cooking them.  Authenticity also disregards one of the greatest pleasures of cooking – spontaneity. The idea of cooking with what I can afford, what’s in season, and with what little equipment I have is a stimulating practice for me as a home cook. If the joy of cooking is in the ability to adapt, to abide by the law of authenticity is to zap the fun out. In fact, history tells us that cooking essentially is adapting to what you have. That’s how grilling over fire came about as a cooking method, and think about Malaysians’ affinity with spices or New Zealand and its love affair with lamb. We make use of what’s around us, and simply, we try to survive. So if the course of a cuisine takes unexpected turns along the way, it’s a sign of changing social, cultural and agricultural environments, or a shift in economic health. Who are we to sit on our high horses and deny those changes?  In the setting of a home kitchen, meanwhile, does using a different species of chilli than my nenekmoyang render my dish inauthentic? Does making my biryani in a cast iron pan with a teacloth over the top rule it out as Hyderabadi? The results may change, and the quality of the dish may vary, but that downfall is a matter of the cook and the diner alone, not the government. While respecting the origins of a cuisine is well and good, it’s far more important to respect the ingredients and the people who cultivate them.  But first, the senseless notion of authenticity must be repaired with the mindset that no one country or region truly owns the food that comes out of it. Authentic is not a flavour; it’s not the blood and toil that go into the making of a dish, it’s not for anyone to call out. It’s a silly technicality that should be put to bed. A cuisine with age and prestige on its side does not grant it the right to refuse change. Because if you listen carefully, food isn’t asking to be protecte d; it’s asking only to be celebrated.
We are a food city. One that caters to the food-obsessed; one that alternates between street and traditional dining, at any budget and time of the day. Here are the 100 best dishes and drinks that truly defines us, from the contentious nasi leamk to the humble roti canai. Loosen your belt – you've got much eating to do."

In addition to free books, NYPL's Summer in the Library will also include a series of free programs for both teens and adults across 92 locations. These events will focus on the love for reading and learning, and will help students fight the so-called ""summer slide"" and prevent them from forgetting their school-learned material.
The program will include activities and workshops like summer reading for kids and teens, reading recommendations put together by NYPL librarians, and even library initiatives for adults.

EDITOR’S NOTE: The Jane hotel’s ballroom and rooftop will close on November 19. The hotel rooms will remain operational through the end of the year and undergo renovation until the entire sale goes through.
We are sad to report that the iconic Jane hotel—the boutique West Village destination at 113 Jane Street that used to be a hotel for sailors—will officially close on November 19 following a recent sale by the owners to hotelier Jeff Klein, who will use the space to expand his private membership club San Vincente Bungalows.
As mentioned in an official email by the current operators of the hotel announcing the shuttering, the landmarked building ""has lived many lives"" since first opening as the American Seamen's Friend Society Sailors' Home and Institute back in 1908, when the 156 rooms on premise only cost guests 25 cents per night.
Four years later, in 1912, the structure was used to house the survivors of the Titanic and, in 1998, the on-site theater became the original space where the culture-shifting rock musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch was first performed.
The Jane Street Theatre, as the Off-Broadway stage was called, was also where tick, tick... BOOM!, Jonathan Larson's famous musical about an aspiring composer in New York City, was mounted. The story behind the writing of the production is now the subject of the critically acclaimed, eponymous Netflix movie directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda and starring Andrew Garfield.
The theater was eventually transformed into the Jane Ballroom, the hotel’s bar, which has been frequented by a slew of notables throughout the years, quickly becoming a legendary downtown destination defined by a now-infamous disco ball hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the room. The likes of Kirsten Dunst, Jennifer Aniston, Mary-Kate Olsen and Jonah Hill, for example, have been spotted attending parties on-site.
As mentioned in an official email, New Yorkers are invited to ""party under [the Jane's] disco ball"" again before the place officially closes in about ten days. Check out Jane Ballroom's Instagram account to browse through its final days of programming."

https://www.timeout.com/usa/news/revealed-the-most-popular-rides-at-walt-disney-world-061323,Timeout,"It’s the world’s largest theme park, filled with magical moments, beloved movie characters and hours of entertainment. Walt Disney World’s biggest draw, however, is obviously the rides. Everyone has a favorite, a ride worth waiting in a line, no matter how long. So how do the rides stack up with the public?
Magic Guides, a Disney travel planning agency, has released the results of its ride rankings to help you plan your next visit to the Magic Kingdom. In a survey of every ride from all four theme parks at Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando (Magic Kingdom Park, Epcot, Disney's Animal Kingdom and Disney's Hollywood Studios), Magic Guides looked at three key factors: Instagram hashtags, Tripadvisor ratings and average monthly search volume for each ride.
Scoring high in all metrics, the ride that came in at number one is Splash Mountain, despite the fact that it’s actually closed. The love for Splash Mountain, which is currently being transformed into “Tiana's Bayou Adventure” inspired by Disney’s The Princess and the Frog, is evident, with an average of 205,193 monthly searches, 323,813 Instagram hashtags, and a high rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Tripadvisor.
The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and Space Mountain follow at numbers two and three. Though the theme song is maddening to some, It’s a Small World comes in at number four. Rounding out the top ten rides at Disney World, in order, are Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, Expedition Everest, Haunted Mansion, Big Thunder Mountain, Star Tours and Jungle Cruise. One surprising fact the study—which also looked at the most popular rides by state—found is that Florida is the only state where Splash Mountain is not the favorite. Epcot's new Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind ride is the favorite there."
https://www.eater.com/2019/9/4/20849781/jack-in-the-box-just-added-more-chicken-to-its-sandwich,Eater,"In the chicken sandwich wars there are established sandwiches, there are better sandwiches, and there are sandwiches with more chicken. Jack in the Box has firmly invested in column C. While Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen was enjoying the sales bump from its two-week-long, sell-out chicken sandwich promotion and contrived social media feuds with Chick-Fil-A and Shake Shack, Jack in the Box was busy cooking up its own low-effort take on the current fast food flavor of the week: a chicken sandwich with not one, but four chicken patties.
Customizing a burger with multiple patties is a hallmark of the fast food industry. In-N-Out has its 4x4, Burger King has its Triple Stacker King, and even Wendy’s has experimented with a Quad Baconator. But few, if any, chains have ever done this to a chicken sandwich — except, of course, for Jack in the Box.
The chain’s Really Big Chicken Sandwich, which first debuted in 1995 with two patties, was revived once again for some reason on September 2 with the option of four chicken patties. For what it's worth, Jack in the Box claimed it wasn’t planning the launch in tandem with the Popeye’s sandwich.
There are a few good reasons why putting multiple fried chicken patties on a sandwich is a bad idea. Chicken sandwiches are breaded and can have sharp edges that benefit from being close to mayonnaise and a bun when customers go in for a bite. Fried chicken in sandwiches also tends to be salty and dry. Having multiple patties only amplifies those quality, turning one’s mouth into an instant desert after one bite. Finally, chicken sandwiches also tend to be thicker than fast-food burger patties, meaning managing four patties is just unwieldy. Taking this into consideration, most chains seem to have focused on improving the chicken recipe and quality of the chicken instead of merely giving customers more of it.
Not Jack in the Box, though. The Really Big Chicken Sandwich is comprised of a hamburger bun with lettuce, sliced tomatoes, mayonnaise, bacon, and slices of “Swiss-style cheese” layered between two to four breaded chicken patties. Each slab of poultry looks like the type of chicken patty one might find on a school lunch tray. The breading and height, meanwhile, give the chicken the appearance of four onion rings stacked inside a burger bun — a worthy alternative to this footnote on the chicken sandwich craze.
Despite being out for three days now, the Jack in the Box’s “more is better” approach doesn’t appear to be receiving the same hype as its Popeyes counterpart. Maybe, Jack should just stick to making great fast food tacos.
Update: This story has been updated to reflect that the Really Big Chicken Sandwich came out in 1995."

Or, perhaps, picture yourself devouring a plate filled with Ladurée desserts, just like the ones surrounding Kirsten Dunst in 2006's Marie Antoinette, while taking in her amazing performance.
That sort of event is exactly what Fork n' Film hopes to provide New Yorkers with when it finally launches in the city next month.
The movie-inspired dining experience has been running strong in Los Angeles since June, making the jump to the other side of the country with screenings of Pixar's iconic Ratatouille starting October 1 through 22.
The experience is pretty straightforward: buy a ticket, show up at the designated space (likely, a rooftop), sit at your table (no movie theater-like seatings here) and start watching the movie as the Fork n' Film team delivers a multi-course meal directly to you, inspired by and timed to key events happening in the film.
To be clear: attending one of these showings isn't going to be cheap. Tickets might cost up to $300 per person.
Banking on the power of all things immersive, company owners Francesca Duncan and Nick Houston have gone on the record about how the idea for the business even came to them. Specifically, talking to the Daily Mail, Duncan revealed that the process started while the couple was watching the iconic chocolate cake scene in the beloved 1996 movie Matilda.
Imagining what the cake would taste like in real life, Duncan and Houston started brainstorming ways to deliver just that to the public, eventually landing on the exact sort of venture that Fork n' Film is. They kicked things off in Los Angeles this summer with a screening of Harry Potter, complete with potions that attendees got to mix on their own. The rest, as they say, is history—and social media.
Folks attending the experience quickly posted about it on TikTok, rapidly bringing attention to a business that seems to have been created with a social media audience in mind.
Given the popularity of the happening, it should come as no surprise that tickets to the next few sessions in New York have already sold out. Word to the wise: keep checking the website to snag passes for the upcoming screenings."
https://www.eater.com/2019/9/13/20863787/whats-the-difference-ale-lager,Eater,"This post originally appeared in an edition of What’s the Difference?, a weekly newsletter for the curious and confused by New York City writer Brette Warshaw. Eater will be publishing all editions that parse food-related differences, though those hardly scratch the surface of the world’s (and the newsletter’s) curiosities: Sign up to get What’s the Difference? in your inbox or catch up on the full archive.
Experientially, the difference between a lager and an ale can be explained with brands of beer everybody knows: lagers are the crisp, thirst-quenching yellow beers like Budweiser and the like; ales are richer/more full-flavored beers that include pale ales (like Sierra Nevada) and everything else that isn’t golden and clear (including Guinness, stouts, IPAs, and beers that nerdy college guys tend to prefer).
While there are many, many variables in beer making — including the kind of grains the beer is based on (Budweiser has rice in it!) and the quantity and kind of hops (craft beers, mostly ales, favor “fruity” hops that tend often have a hint of weed flavor to them), the functional difference between the two categories is in the kind of yeast used to make them.
Ales are made with top-fermenting yeasts that work at warmish temperatures; lagers are made with bottom-fermenting yeasts that need the liquid they’re fermenting to be cold and still for a longish time. That’s why lagers are called lagers — it comes from the German word “lagern,” which means “to store.” Lagers were originally fermented in caves in cold months and drunk in the spring, when the weather warmed up and the yeast was done with its job.
The advent of refrigeration and the general thirst-quenching quality of lagers have made them the dominant global style of beer. The reason craft breweries almost exclusively produce ales is because the time and storage requirements to make quality lagers is a much bigger cash suck than ales, which can be fermented, hopped, and canned in just a few weeks."

The latest outpost by the British celebrity and chef marks the restaurant’s fourth location in the United States, joining others in Washington DC, Las Vegas and Orlando. Just like those, this one will welcome patrons through a replica of a red phone booth door. How… very British!
We won't hate on the eatery just yet, especially given the pretty hefty menu of traditional pub classics on offer alongside creative takes on the traditional fish and chips dish.
In the former category, diners will enjoy a fish combo, which comes with three pieces of crispy cod, natural sea salt chips and a choice of two sauces. Shrimp and chicken versions of the food are also available.
Modern iterations served include the fishwich, made with crispy cod wrapped in warm naan bread, avocado sauce, shredded cabbage and tomato relish; the chickenwich, made with chicken tenders wrapped in naan, cabbage slaw, sliced Roma tomatoes, house-made pickles and Old Bay seasoning; and dirty chips #3, with bacon, cheddar cheese, green onion and sour cream.
On the dessert side, we suggest trying both treat options: the sticky toffee shake topped with fresh whipped cream and the Biscoff cookie version featuring crumbled cookies and whipped cream.
The menu is intentionally limited and straightforward, seeking to highlight what is by many considered to be the British food par excellence.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/the-worlds-largest-gingerbread-village-is-returning-to-manhattan-110422,Timeout,"See the spectacular GingerBread Lane display at Essex Market.
When Jon Lovitch made his first gingerbread village as a teenager in Kansas City in 1994, he could never have dreamed that he’d someday turn the hobby into his full-time job, display his creations in New York City and set the world record for gingerbread houses.
Fast forward 28 years, and the “Gingerbread Man,” who holds the Guinness World Record for largest gingerbread village, is ready to unveil GingerBread Lane at Essex Market on the Lower East Side later this month. The spectacular display will return to Manhattan after heading outside of the city for two years amid the pandemic.
This year, Lovitch is making about 1,500 gingerbread houses, with 500 each going to displays in New York City, Salt Lake City and Kansas City. The village includes precious details, like jelly bean roof tiles, candy cane decor and clever signs made out of icing. It takes 1,000 pounds of gingerbread and 8,000 pounds of icing to create 1,500 gingerbread houses, along with the help of several hardworking dehumidifiers to keep everything dry.
The process takes all year with the season ramping up to 100-hour weeks in the fall when the air constantly smells sweet and gingerbread houses cram into every nook and cranny of his basement in Queens.
For Lovitch, this year-round project is truly a labor of love. He uses the knowledge and work ethic he developed as a professional chef working in some of America’s most coveted hotel kitchens to push through the challenges of creating such intricately detailed, time-consuming work.
After each season, he gives away the gingerbread houses for people to display at their own homes. While the houses are made mostly of food items, they are not edible, he cautions, especially considering many of the materials are expired.
As soon as the holiday season ends, he’s on the lookout for discounted, expired candy to use for next year’s display, delighted to score things like boxes of candy canes for 10 cents or jelly beans from 2018. When the winter solstice rolls around even before the year 2023 begins, he’ll start making next year’s GingerBread Lane.
Lovitch’s passion for the project began when he was working as an apprentice chef at a hotel in Kansas City where the pastry chef made a gingerbread house. He noticed visitors’ positive reactions to the chef’s creation, so he wanted to try his hand at making his own. That first year in 1994 as a teenager, he made 14 gingerbread houses, what he’d now consider a small display.
Over the years as he lived in different cities for work, including Washington, D.C. and Pittsburgh, he’d display the growing GingerBread Lane in those cities as well. It even found a home at the Smithsonian for a while.
When he moved to New York City and saw a news article about the world’s largest gingerbread village, he realized his was actually larger. So he set out to provide the proper documentation to Guinness World Records, which certified his epic gingerbread village as the world’s biggest.
Each year, he pretends to be a regular visitor to GingerBread Lane, so he can hear people’s unfiltered reactions.
See GingerBread Lane at Essex Market on the Lower East Side from Saturday, November 26 through Sunday, January 15."

At the time, he was shooting a new segment for his food and travel show, Parts Unknown, with fellow chef Eric Ripert. And while the show's production company, Zero Point Zero, has released a final season of the show airing right now on CNN, the last episode will take place in New York City's Lower East Side. That is to say, the episode he was filming in Alsace, France just prior to his death will not air.
Throughout the course of this season, Bourdain eats, talks, and ingratiates himself with locals in Kenya, Asturias, Indonesia, and Far West Texas before hitting Manhattan. Still, the absence of that one missing piece is felt. In the un-released Alsace segment, Ripert was intended to shepherd Bourdain to vineyards, restaurants, and food markets along the French-German border. They hadn't made it everywhere, but they'd certainly begun.
When news broke of Bourdain's death, he and Ripert had just wrapped a scene in which they sat together, over plates of food, across from Chef Jean-Yves Schillinger. Schillinger later toldPEOPLE that Bourdain was “just like himself, just like he was on television” that day.
Unfortunately, that footage will remain private. We can all listen to Bourdain wax poetic about the salty, the acrid, and the sour one final time on the streets of New York on Sunday, November 11 (9pm ET on CNN).

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/best-fast-food-chicken-nuggets-ranked,Thrillist,"When the cafeteria served chicken nuggets at school, you were having a great day. Now you’re older, and you’re confronted with the downsides to being an adult (bills, work responsibilities, an acute awareness of your own mortality). But the one big plus is that every day can be chicken nuggets day if you want it to be.
Chicken nuggets have never been more delicious (or more culinarily creative!) than they are right now. To help you decide which drive-thru you should pull into next, we hit up more than a dozen of the country’s biggest chains that serve the humble, satisfying chicken morsels you know and love. More specifically, we judged them on important criteria like juiciness of the chicken, creativity, and overall flavor. Here are the best ones in America.
These greasy looking, slimy tasting, wholly unappetizing chicken bites can’t be a serious menu item. Clearly Chick-fil-A is pulling that The Producers scheme on us— it’s bad-on-purpose. Because there is no other reason for them to exist.
Do not go to Cook Out for the chicken nuggets. The breading is well-seasoned, but that’s about where the positives end. The meat is squishy and while we know chicken nuggets aren’t typically made with the highest quality chicken at fast food restaurants, Cook Out does a good job of reminding us of that. There are six sauces to choose from—Cook Out Sauce, BBQ, Honey Mustard, Polynesian, Ranch, Buffalo—but it doesn’t matter because they can’t save these nuggets.
It’d be cool if DQ had a rotisserie behind the counter with tiny chicken bites spinning around on it, but sadly not all dreams can come true. In reality, the bites may draw comparisons to Chick-fil-A size-wise, but that’s where the comparisons stop. Here’s the good news: these breading-free chicken morsels are undeniably juicy. But there’s a fine line between juicy and soggy, and they err on the side of the latter. Some bites are all gristle, while others are like eating a nugget that’s been soaking in a vat of cooking oil for hours. DQ deserves some credit for the clever “rotisserie chicken bite” branding, but it’ll make you long for a standard breaded nugget.
“Cardboard chicken nothings” is a more apt description of these popcorn nuggets. The nugget overall lacks any sort of crispness, and the meat itself isn’t juicy at all, though it lacks the gristly quality of an ultra-low quality budget nugget. And the breading features plenty of black pepper seasoning, which saves it from lacking any flavor whatsoever. If you’re pulling up at Sonic, do yourself a favor and grab a burger along with an ice cold slush, blast, or shake. Skip the nugs.
Wendy’s seemingly focused so much on the spicy part of the “spicy nugget” that it forgot the nugget element is equally important. While the spicy end of the bargain delivers (and lingers a fair amount even after you’ve had a couple bites), and most of the nuggets are crispy, the nugget is subpar overall. It’s an uber-thin, dry, gristle-filled item. The heat is its only redeeming quality. You’re better off licking the seasoning from this nugget and eating a satisfying Wendy’s Crispy Nugget instead.
White Castle instantly earns points for taking the basic chicken nugget form factor and engineering it into a ring-like shape, though the execution is a tad questionable. Ours resembled flattened chicken discs with holes in the middle. While traditional nuggets don’t typically inspire philosophical questions, these left us wondering about the point of the ring shape before we dived in for a taste. But upon first bite, it became a little clearer. Our theory is that it’s all about the surface area, though we’re admittedly not great at math. Going with a flat ring shape with a circular punch out in the middle results in more breaded surface, which thereby results in additional crispiness. This extra crisp is delightful, but the chicken within is too dry, flat, and flavorless to satisfy a craving for chicken nuggets.
Ever want to eat a starfish you find washed up on the beach? Us either, but this star-shaped chicken nugget is much tastier anyways. The stars aren’t juicy in the least (and Carl’s should consider adding any kind of seasoning whatsoever), but the chicken to breading ratio is acceptable, each nugget is crisp, and there’s something about the small joy of devouring a tiny star bite by little bite. If you’re someone who eats primarily with their eyes, this is the nugget for you. If you’re super hungry, it might make more sense to supplement these with one of the chain’s massive burgers.
These small pieces of chicken are available to order by the half pound (with fries), and that’s a great thing because their size and crispiness make them delightfully poppable. The breading is well-seasoned and holds up well in the cardboard container in which the bites come packed, leaving you with a mountain of bite-sized vehicles for the BBQ, Honey Mustard, Ranch, and Frank’s RedHot Buffalo sauces you can get on the side. Like with a lot of chicken bites from fast food chains, many of these come with a lot of breading and little visible chicken inside. And the ones that did contain a substantial amount of chicken were often on the dry side and gristly, hence the need for more and more sauce. Get them with the Frank’s Buffalo sauce. You’re gonna need it.
It may seem counterintuitive to say that a chicken nugget tastes like actual chicken. After all, don’t all chicken nuggets taste like chicken? Actually, no. Many fast food nuggets taste like salty, deep fried breading with a hint of black pepper. But not chicken. That’s why this BK nugget is a breath of fresh air. There’s nothing particularly exceptional about it on the surface—sure, the morsels are suitably crispy, and there’s significantly more chicken here than in skimpier nuggets elsewhere. But this is higher in the ranking because the nugget imparts superior chicken flavors, plain and simple. It’s one of the chicken-ier nuggets in fast food, and in a sea of nuggets, that stands out.
Don’t let the apostrophic spelling of these nuggets fool you. Even though they share some grammatical similarity to plant-based chicken substitutes, these are the most real, real chicken of nearly every fast food outpost. No pink slime, super-processed, identically shaped orbs of sadness that simply exist as dipping sauce-delivery mechanisms here. Instead, they’re like Mini Me versions of the popular Whatahick’n Strips. Available in six- and nine-piece boxes, they’re hot and juicy on the inside, audibly crunchy and well-battered on the outside, and excellent entirely on their own merit. But for us, naked nuggets require a saucy companion and you’ll find 10 different sauces to choose from, including hot, black-peppery gravy. Order them as a meal and you’ll even get two triangles of buttery Texas toast to dip in that sauce between bites or provide the foundation for an impromptu DIY chicken sandwich project.
We all know the world-famous chicken chain loves to kid around, as evidenced by its commercials and its Twitter account. So it should be no surprise that an order of KFC’s popcorn chicken is housed in a bright red, movie popcorn-esque box. Things get even better from there. The breading surrounding these nugs is exemplary—a 20 out of ten. Some nuggets have so little chicken in them that it’s become a morsel of fried, crispy bread. You will not care. And while the chicken isn’t particularly juicy (and there is some gristle in each box), overall you get a full meal-sized amount of nuggets that pair great with a side of mashed potatoes or its Finger Lickin’ Good sauce. Colonel Sanders would be proud.
Unlike the chain’s Spicy Nuggets, its Crispy Chicken Nuggets are worthy of having a cult following. They’re much thicker nuggets that pack plenty of chicken into each one. The best nuggets have mastered the perfect chicken-to-breading ratio, and Wendy’s has solved this eternal riddle. The black pepper seasoning is noticeably delicious, and adds a subtle kick. Maybe one day the brand will offer a half spicy and half crispy nugget deal, letting you experience both spicy heat from one and superior chicken from the other.
The glorious nugget was invented in the ‘60s, with McDonald’s popularizing them in the ‘80s. And yet, Facebook existed eight years before Jack in the Box added chicken nuggets to the menu. The chain has been around since the ‘50s. Considering how delicious these suckers are, it’s shocking it didn’t happen sooner. The white meat nuggets appear so small it seems unlikely there’d be much chicken in there. But there’s plenty of chicken in each bite, and almost no residual gristle, along with a delicious breading that’s been well-seasoned with black pepper. The nugget is so crisp, and the chicken is so juicy, you won’t even need a sauce—though the chain does have Frank’s RedHot. Added bonus: You can snag an order of nuggets even during breakfast hours. If you think eating nuggets for breakfast is weird, take a trip to your local Chick-fil-A for one of those transcendent Chicken Minis.
It tastes like your childhood, and this nugget doesn’t appear to have changed much since then. (If you thought these were made with “pink slime,” you’re wrong.) It doesn’t have to change. It’s a McNugget: hot and crispy, with a unique tempura breading. No, it’s not the juiciest chicken around, and it should be illegal to eat it without dipping it in honey mustard first, but it’s a menu item that’s stood the test of time. It was the first popular nugget in fast food. It represents American ingenuity, convenience, and loads of flavor, all for a couple bucks. In a world where the status quo changes on a dime, the McNugget is always there. It’s still fantastic. And its enduring popularity says something about its quality.
Let’s put that unpleasantness with the whole “grilled nuggets” thing behind us and focus on what Chick-fil-A does best: breaded chicken nuggets. Why are these so good? Is it the MSG in every bite? Is it because it’s pressure cooked? The hand-breading? The high quality chicken that’s practically gristle-free? You probably know the answer: it’s all of these things.
Each bite is perfectly juicy without being oily. The breading is uneven, and in some spots on the nugget, there’s barely any—a stark contrast to the uniform breading in almost every other fast food nugget. This should be a ding against the Chick-fil-A nugget, but it’s not. If there’s not a ton of breading in one spot, that’s just dandy because you’re going to get a mouthful of crispy, delicious chicken. It doesn’t even need sauce (though there are solid options).
Popeyes is relatively new to the fast food chicken nugget scene, having only just launched this menu offering in summer of 2021. At the time, the chain boasted that the nuggets are made in the same way as the chicken on its sensational fried chicken sandwich, instantly setting extremely high expectations for itself. Turns out the hype is real. These are some of the bets chicken nuggets you can get right now.
Part of why we love them so much is that unique, signature Popeyes fried chicken flavor that's fried into each one. The seasonings are there. You can detect the buttermilk in the breading. The chicken itself is tender, though not particularly juicy, like a lot of Popeyes chicken tenders we've eaten over the years. But, wow. That flavor. If you're craving a Popeyes Chicken Sandwich, but want a little less food for one reason or another, these nuggets will do the job. Our only wish is that they weren't so greasy. Then they'd be absolutely perfect.
Usually, brands slap the word on ""premium"" on products that are merely above average just to squeeze a little more money out of you. That's not the case with Arby's Premium Chicken Nuggets. They're the real deal. In fact, they're the best chicken nuggets in all of fast food right now, according to us at least.
The curly fries purveyor absolutely nails the chicken here. The meat—something Arby's has a little experience with—is tender and probably as juicy as you can possibly make it in such small pieces. Then again, these nuggets aren't exactly small. They remind us more of stubby chicken tenders than anything, and that's a good thing. And unlike most nuggets we've tried, Arby's keeps the overall amount of breading in check. providing just enough for the necessary crispy and crunch in each bite. You simply won't find any nuggets that are mostly breading here. You're getting mostly chicken, which is something other chains should aspire to offer in their nuggets. It's weird that we even have to say that, but here we are.
Rethink your go-to stacked roast beef sandwich order, because Arby's has set the standard for truly delicious chicken nuggets.
When did McDonald’s first start serving McNuggets?According to the history of the McNuggets, McNuggets first debuted at McDonald's locations nationwide in 1983.
Does Popeyes have chicken nuggets?It sure does. Popeyes currently offers chicken nuggets in an eight-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 48-piece orders.
Where can you get Impossible Chicken Nuggets?Burger King was the first fast food chain to test Impossible Chicken Nuggets in selected locations in October 2021. They currently do not appear on Burger King’s nationwide menu. For now, you'll have to head to your nearest major grocery store for packages of Impossible Nuggets.
When is National Chicken Nuggets Day in 2022?This important food holiday falls on Sunday, November 13, 2022."

Over the last year, pizzaiolos across the country have created things like the pizza topped with mini pizza slices, and the hamburger with mini pizza buns. And now, New Jersey’s own Tony Baloney’s is introducing a pie that just might win the award for craziest pizza in America. Say hello to the restaurant’s pizza topped with more than two dozen soft tacos and a lake of guacamole.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/this-scenic-train-through-the-adirondacks-officially-returns-on-april-4-032323,Timeout,"It’s been rated as one of the most scenic train rides in the world.
An Amtrak train route that has been named one of the “Top 10 Most Scenic Train Rides in the World” by National Geographic is coming back after a three-year pause.
Adirondak service resumed just to Albany on December 5, but when it returns on April 4, it’ll offer a beautiful ride through the mountains, from NYC’s Moynihan Train Hall at Penn Station all the way to Montreal, Quebec’s Gare Centrale/Central Station, covering 400 miles in 10 hours.
RECOMMENDED: I took the new, 8-hour Amtrak train to Burlington, Vermont. Here’s why it was worth it.
According to the Montreal Gazette, it’ll stop at Yonkers, Croton-Harmon, Poughkeepsie, Rhinecliff, Hudson, Albany-Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga Springs, Fort Edward, Whitehall, Ticonderoga, Port Henry, Westport, Port Kent, Plattsburgh, Rouses Point, St-Lambert, Quebec, and Montreal. It’s a 10-hour ride from beginning to end but is worth it if you want your journey to be as scenic as your destination.
The Gazette says it is “popular with Montrealers and New Yorkers.” In 2019, the route had 117,000 passengers, which was a 5% jump from the previous year. But it hasn’t stopped in Montreal since 2020, when it was shut down during the pandemic. Service to Albany only resumed in December 2022.
The first northbound Adirondack train will depart Moynihan Train Hall at New York Penn Station at 8:41am on April 3 and scheduled to arrive at Montreal’s Central Station at 8:16pm. The first southbound train will leave Montreal at 11:10am on April 4, with a scheduled arrival in New York at 10:15pm, according to the Gazette.
“Whether you’re experiencing the greatness of New York City, the culture of Montreal or the beauty of the Hudson Valley and Lake Champlain region, the return of the Adirondack provides customers with a reliable, relaxing and sustainable way to travel,” said Amtrak President Roger Harris."

https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/features/newly-elected-nyc-city-council-member-shahana-hanifs-guide-to-little-bangladesh,Theinfatuation,"Walk down the stretch of Church Avenue between McDonald Avenue and Dahill Road known as Kensington’s “Little Bangladesh” with Shahana Hanif, and you’re not likely to get very far. People will stop you every few feet to talk with the 30-year-old feminist organizer and activist, and it’s clear that she’s looked to as a leader in her community.
The Kensington-born politician is set to become not only the first woman to represent District 39 on New York’s City Council, but also the first Muslim and Southeast Asian representative. Her neighborhood’s tight-knit Bangladeshi community was at the heart of her grassroots campaign, and it shows in the way she’s greeted by residents as though she’s part of their extended families.
Although some people tend to think of Jackson Heights as the epicenter of Bangladeshi culture in New York City (even Hanif’s family used to venture to Queens to eat out on special occasions when she was a child), Kensington is home to a vibrant Southeast Asian community. According to Hanif, Kensington’s Bangladeshi residents come primarily from three areas: Chittagong, Sandwip, and Noakhali, regions that are more poverty-stricken than some other places in Bangladesh.
Kensington’s Bangladeshi community is perhaps most visible in and around the restaurants and grocery stores along Church Avenue. Hanif says that there is a sort of “collective solidarity” around the hyper-regional food served in the neighborhood, and at any given time of day, you’ll find restaurants packed with Bangladeshi men having tea and samosas—the dining rooms a sort of liminal space between a community center and living room.
Although politics is her passion, Hanif grew up with one foot in the restaurant world. Her father, who was among the first wave of Bangladeshi immigrants to come to Brooklyn over 35 years ago, owns Radhuni Sweets on McDonald Avenue. Standing across the street from her father’s restaurant, the presumptive City Council member talks about the intricacies of Bangladeshi seafood dishes and how she can’t eat without fresh green chili pepper to open up the palate.
“To declare loving food is really an act of resistance for me,” Hanif says. It wasn’t always so easy for her to talk openly about food, or to be photographed while eating—something she made a point to do throughout her campaign as part of an effort to highlight small businesses, while simultaneously changing the way female candidates are portrayed. Growing up, Hanif was subject to a different set of rules and expectations than the boys in her community, which made for a complicated relationship to food. Now, she sees food not only as a vital way to fuel organizing efforts and connect with her constituents, but as a means to preserve culture.
“I look forward to eating more ... pairing this with how the city addresses food insecurity, how the city cultivates and preserves Black, brown, and immigrant food production across our ethnic enclaves. When I eat in Jackson Heights, in Flushing, I feel a connection to our immigration pathways,” she says.
Food sustainability, both in terms of access to food as well as stable jobs for restaurant and grocery workers, are issues she’s passionate about. After the pandemic shuttered many restaurants and markets in the area, Hanif worked to spearhead a crowdfunded mutual aid program for undocumented individuals in her district. And when peak Covid hit during the month of Ramadan, she focused on finding ways to provide culturally specific food to the area’s Bangladeshi and South Asian communities.
Hanif says that fighting for the dignity of restaurant and grocery workers is not only a key component of her platform, but of keeping Kensington’s Bangladeshi community thriving.
Fortunately, Kensington’s Bangladeshi food scene is not only stable, it’s thriving. Here are some of Hanif’s favorite spots in the neighborhood, from a woman-owned cafe that serves some of the best fuchka in the five boroughs to a traditional sweet shop.
Shahana’s order from Ghoroa is the beef teheri with chicken roast on the side — follow her lead, and you won’t be disappointed. A festive dish similar to biryani or pulao, teheri  is made with kalijira rice, a nutty varietal native to Bangladesh characterized by its miniature grains. Top it with some gravy from the chicken roast, then slice up and mix in the fresh green chili peppers that are served on the side to infuse your meal with a pleasant heat.
According to Hanif, Radhuni (her father’s place) is the best in the neighborhood for Bangladeshi seafood dishes. Radhuni is busy all day, but in the mornings, they turn their hot counter into an assembly line that churns out some of the best breakfast wraps in all of Brooklyn. They start with a fresh chapati the size of your face, then add any combination of spiced scrambled eggs, sauteed fresh vegetables, and aloo bhaji, a potato dish that you’ll find at almost every restaurant in the neighborhood. At night, come here for the traditional seafood dishes like patri ni machi, a masala-infused salmon dish that’s steamed inside of banana leaves.
A relative newcomer slightly off the main drag, Sonia Cafe is quickly becoming the go-to spot for Bangladeshi snacks (the best in Kensington, according to Hanif). Their samosas and piyaju are outstanding, but the real reason people come here is for the fuchka. Similar to but not quite the same as pani puri, crisp, hollow puri are filled with chickpeas, chilies, red onion, herbs, and grated hard-boiled eggs. They’re served with a container of tamarind water, which you’ll want to spoon into the puri before popping them whole into your mouth.
Like most spots on this list, Abdullah serves an all-day savory menu of curries, rice dishes, and flatbreads, but sweets are the main attraction here. They’re best known for Rasgulla—sweet dumplings made from fresh cheese curds called cchhena and semolina that are cooked in sugar syrup. The box of mixed cham cham is another great option if you want to try a few different kinds of sweets, and their brightly-colored laddu are fudgy and sweet. A longtime neighborhood fixture, this is where Hanif’s mom would order Rasgulla for special occasions.
Madhuban is Hanif’s pick for the best naan in the neighborhood, with an airy interior and a delicate char on the outside. The plain naan is perfect for pairing with all of Madhuban’s curries and stews, but the garlic naan is good enough to be a satisfying snack on its own. Hanif says beef stew is the go-to order here, and take note that even without the addition of fresh chilies, the dish has some heat. They also serve rice dishes, including teheri, biryani, and pulao, as well as a variety of traditional sweets.
Kabir’s is a great place to stop for a snack at almost any time of day. Hanif comes here for the chicken patty, which she says is unlike anything else you can get in the neighborhood. The “patty” is an ample triangle of puff pastry stuffed with spicy ground chicken. She’s also a fan of the milk tea, which is strong and bracingly sweet. It’s a perfect accompaniment to their green chili-studded pakoras, which are available in the afternoons and evenings. In the morning you can pick up a samosa, which on any given day might have slightly different ingredients in the filling.
Married couple Eva Tringali and Christina Mauricio run their business with a focus on regulars, and that’s exactly what you’ll want to be.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/nyc-tears-down-unused-outdoor-dining-sheds,Thrillist,"While dining sheds are still allowed on New York City streets, the city is making moves to get rid of old and unused ones.
Last Tuesday, city workers removed almost 100 outdoor dining structures from the streets of the Big Apple, CBS News reports. If a restaurant's dining shed is either unused or has a history of violations, it will be taken down.
The city has removed 169 of them in total, but it says that getting rid of them is the last resort. The first goal is to bring the outdoor dining sheds up to compliance.
In a tweet, the NYC Department of Sanitation urged citizens to help out with the clean up. ""See a shed that needs to go?,"" it reads. ""Call 311.""
Outdoor dining structures originally emerged in NYC as a way for restaurants to survive during the earlier stages of the pandemic. After being warmly welcomed by New Yorkers and tourists alike, dining sheds have remained, with permits being extended multiple times.
While many residents love the new outdoor dining solution, a few are still fighting to get rid of them for good, citing garbage and pests as the main problems caused by the structures. At this time, the city is still finalizing rules to define the future of outdoor dining in the city."

According to Real New York Birther Code, the geographical whereabouts in which your heart began to beat matters The Most. If you listened to these slavishly insecure, Gotham-hatched headcases -- if you actually assigned value to the things they wrote at the bottom of articles like this one -- you might decide that your entire person is fully formed by your first human breath, that your entire lived experience is innately informed by where you first filled your lungs. You might conclude, in other words, that you’re not a real New Yorker unless you were born here. After all, they were, and they said so.
Where am I going with this, besides straight to the special circle of Hell reserved for writers who feed the trolls? Oh, right, the point: where you’re from only matters as much as you allow people to tell you it matters. And those maniacal 212ers, 646ers, and 718ers who try to tell me that I can’t express opinions about my lived experience in New York City? They can’t tell me nothin’.

Kacey from New Dorp may chime in, if only to remind me that “bridge-and-tunnel whiners like you are exactly what’s ruining old New York,” even though Staten Island is actually more “New Jersey” than a lot of actual Jersey.

So I wrote a follow-up acknowledging the mistake. When you don’t write what you know, you’re at an ever-growing risk of missing the point.
Other times, though, this counterpunch is thrown not to instruct, but to prohibit. Like, for example, writing about the experience of living in New York City. I ride the same subways, schlepp groceries bought in the same narrow aisles, and pay the same $7 for the same crappy beers. I know what these things feel like because I do these things. I have as much license to talk about them as the sucker sucking back seven-dollar suds next to me, no matter whether he was born in Soho, Staten Island, Upstate, or -- gasp -- somewhere beyond the boundaries of New York entirely.

If were a New York fabulist -- someone who indirectly insinuated that he was born in NYC by writing about “authentic New York,” with its “subway tokens” & “murder” -- I would fear the all-seeing fanaticism of their wrath. That would make me a liar and a poseur, bloody chum in the murky waters of the comment sections, subway cars & dive bars where sharks from Washington Heights & Boerum Hill hang out. They’d tear me apart for gentrifying their city, co-opting their sacrosanct heritage, and stealing their thunder. Maybe they’d be right.
But that’s not what I am. I’m just one more transplant in a city full of them. I like writing about what I see, hear, and sometimes smell in this sprawling metropolis, and I’m lucky enough to do it professionally. Why is that so threatening, birthers? That if non-natives participate in shaping this city’s cultural future, it will somehow steal away the “New York” in your blood? First of all, grow up. Second of all, consult a doctor immediately, because if there’s even a drop of actual New York in your blood, you’re just minutes away from scurvy.
Of course, this doesn’t mean I’m always right. Lord, almighty, no it doesn’t. Often times, I’m dead wrong -- but not because I wasn’t born here, just because I am occasionally daft. When the bloodthirsty natives stumble across some fuzzy Infante logic, though, they have a lot of trouble grasping this principle, and its inverse. My wrongness isn’t specifically linked to the fact that I wasn’t born here, just like there’s no inherent rightness attached to being born here.
So, am I a New Yorker, or an asshole from New Jersey, or a preppie douchebag from Connecticut? We’ve gotta categorize each other, right? I’ll let you decide for yourselves which bucket I belong in. See you in the comments.
Oh, and by the way: Hoboken isn't really a part of New York City. Anyone who thinks otherwise probably wasn’t even born here.

https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/best-bec-bacon-egg-cheese-nyc,Theinfatuation,"Despite what your friends in Ohio may believe, the BEC is more quintessentially NYC than any tall green statue or Frank Sinatra song. You can get a BEC at just about any bodega, and it'll probably be good—but we're looking for the top examples in the city. We teamed up with NY Forever and asked for tips on where to find the best BECs, and we put together this initial list of our favorites. This is a never-ending search, so stay tuned for updates, and let us know if you have sandwiches you think we should eat.
Yes, you can purchase a solid BEC at just about any bodega, but most bodegas don't have Balthazar ciabatta. Court Street Grocers does, and that's a big part of the reason why you should go out of your way to get a BEC here. The ciabatta bun is crisp and chewy, and it comes stuffed with soft scrambled eggs and a generous amount of quality bacon. There's also a little arugula in there. It doesn't bring much to the table, but it's always nice to know that you're consuming a vitamin or two with your breakfast.
Everything at Edith's is a made with a bit of flair. Their house pastrami sandwich comes smothered special sauce and sauerkraut, and they have a signature coffee-tahini slushy that's essentially a breakfast milkshake. You should come for both of those things, but the headliner here is the BEC&L. As the name hints, this sandwich comes with a crispy latke stuffed in the middle. It looks unwieldy, and it is—but there are times in life when you need to eat something excessive and unnecessary (when you're hungover, for example). The bagels are especially dense and doughy, and they're unlike any others in NYC.
Edith's isn't the only place putting latkes on bagels. At Baz in Nolita, you can pick up an egg sandwich stuffed with latke hash, with shreds of crispy potato that perfectly compliment the mess of American cheese that spills out the side. Add optional bacon, and you have yourself one of the city's top BECs. This sandwich sounds excessive, but it works surprisingly well. It helps that Baz makes one of the city's top bagels.
If you don't eat gluten, it can be hard to find a great BEC. It can also be tough to find a gluten-free bagel that's good enough to remind you why bagels are one of our staple food groups—but you can get both of those things at Modern Bread & Bagel. Stop by for a BEC packed with scrambled eggs and cheddar. The bacon is vegan, and it doesn't taste like much, but the big, chewy bagels make up for this. If you want, you can get your whole sandwich vegan.
Rex is the premier destination for a BEC in Hell's Kitchen. You can customize your breakfast sandwich in a number of ways (avocado, spinach, hot sauce, etc.), but don't be afraid to go the classic route. Get your BEC on a surprisingly dense and buttery brioche bun, and enjoy a perfect, compact sandwich fused together by melted white cheddar. If you need something more substantial, you can opt for the messy breakfast Cubano with pork, pickles, and eggs. But we prefer to keep it simple.
On any given weekend afternoon, half the people at this West Village cafe will be in workout clothes or PJs. The line will probably be out the door, but it moves fast because most just want something with caffeine. If you don’t get offended by nontraditional BECs, get Merriweather’s version with an over-easy egg, white cheddar, and crispy prosciutto on brioche. With its tangy harissa, avocado, and tomato, the sandwich gets messy, so don’t start eating without a stack of napkins nearby.
John’s Deli in Windsor Terrace is exactly the kind of place where you’d expect to find an excellent bacon, egg, and cheese. You’ll see decades-old wood paneling, shelves stacked with boxes of pasta, and a few gruff guys behind the counter slinging sandwiches. The ratios here are golden: Exactly the right amounts of fried egg, oozing American cheese, and very crispy bacon are contained within the bouncy confines of a hard roll. The uninitiated might ask, ""What’s so special about this sandwich?"" If you have to ask, you’ll never know.
Have you been let down by overcooked eggs, partially melted cheese, and un-sauced bread on a breakfast sandwich? That will never happen at Southside Coffee, a tiny coffee shop in South Slope where people line up for sandwiches, cinnamon buns, pie, and Counter Culture coffee. Your first order of business should be the New School sandwich. The soft and buttery scrambled eggs, bacon, and sriracha-miso-tahini spread on a crusty seeded hero will undo any malaise caused by a subpar bodega BEC.
Imagine the best plate of thick-cut bacon and fried eggs you’ve ever had. There’s a crunch in every bite of crispy pork, and the yolk is still runny when you cut into it. Now envision that topped with a blanket of melted cheese and served on a freshly-baked poppy seed roll. That's the BEC at Daily Provisions. It’s a perfectly-executed breakfast sandwich that you’ll probably finish in just a few bites.
If you didn’t believe in the miracle of hash browns in your breakfast sandwich before, we invite you to try Golden Diner’s Chinatown Egg Sando. This excellent BEC comes on a cushiony sesame scallion milk bun from a local Chinatown bakery, with at least half a carton of eggs scrambled and then layered with American cheese, and a big crunchy hashbrown to top it all off. The hashbrown is key. It’s almost a full inch thick, and the crispy texture contrasts perfectly with the soft bun and eggs.
Gertie does breakfast well. That's why this Williamsburg restaurant gets packed on weekend mornings, and it's why you should go out of your way to eat an egg sandwich here. You can get your BEC on an English muffin, but we aren't sure why you'd do that when Gertie makes their own bagels. Those bagels are great—but the MVP of the sandwich will always be the pickled peppers. They're like a sweet, tangy cheat code.
A thin, chewy Greenberg's bagel is the ideal vehicle for the thick pillow of eggs and nearly-crunchy bacon in this BEC. But to really make this sandwich memorable, add a hash brown and hot sauce. The hash brown provides an extra-crispy crust on top of the eggs, and the hot sauce mixes into the melted cheese to create a hot cheese sauce that seeps into the eggs.
Technically, you can order the aptly-named New Yorker sandwich from Norma’s Corner Shoppe on any style of bread—but for a BEC worthy of this guide, you need to get yours on a scallion cheddar biscuit. This Ridgewood cafe's biscuits are crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside, and they're the perfect vehicles for a soft baked egg, thick slabs of spicy bacon, and a generous portion of cheddar that’s broiled in the oven.
From yeast and cake to mochi and vegan varieties, here's what to get when any old doughnut won't do.
When you want to start your day with carbs doused in maple syrup, head to one of these spots.

Horti, the popular houseplant subscription company, is opening a new Williamsburg storefront dubbed Horti Play. Sprawling across 5,000 square feet, the new store is billing itself as the largest indoor plant store in Brooklyn, and it will welcome plant enthusiasts into an enormous urban jungle aimed at educating customers about all kinds of living plants.
Upon entering the store, visitors will get the chance to walk through a botanical garden filled with large and rare plants, including the famous broad-leaved Birds of Paradise, the Philodendron Giganteum, and even the Euphorbia Trigona cactus, among others. At the center of the store, a Victorian glass greenhouse will be the educational center where the real plant-centered magic will happen. There, guests will be able to participate in intimate talks, soothing sound baths, and a slew of other educational activities revolving around the world of plants, including live performances and apothecary workshops.
""Forming relationships with houseplants is at the core of our business, and Horti Play has been designed to reject the throw-away culture of shopping and instead put connection with nature at the forefront,"" Puneet Sabharwal, Horti's Co-Founder and CEO, said in a statement. ""There isn’t a houseplant store like this anywhere in New York City, and we look forward to using the space as the conduit to many long-lasting houseplant relationships.""
Horti Play is located at 432 Rodney Street. You can visit the store Monday through Friday from 11 am–5 pm, and on Saturday and Sunday from 11 am–7 pm. For more information and to check out the store's event schedule, you can visit this website."

Unsurprisingly, the setup is back for a second year in a row starting November 17 through February 2023, with expanded public hours and, of course, the return of the 7,500-square-foot skating rink for visitors of all ages, plus winter-adjacent activities, food and drink options, on-premise games and fire pits.
The rink itself will be open on Thursdays through Sundays and during all New York City public school holidays (specific hours vary daily, check details on the Governors Island website) but the village will be operating seven days a week throughout the season.
Guests will get to rent bikes and sleds from Blazing Saddles NYC or partake in on-premise activities like cornhole, can jam, games of giant Jenga, arts programming and they'll also be able to admire a sparkling display of holiday lights all throughout historic Colonels Row, where the village is set up.
Food wise, Little Eva's will be open daily, serving a seasonal menu featuring new takes on classic comfort foods (think fish and chips, vegan chili and brats, for example), warm drinks and more. There will also be a rotating cast of local food trucks on premise throughout the season.

""In addition to some pretty spectacular skating, Winter Village visitors will once again be able to enjoy some of the same amazing food trucks, exciting programming and stunning landscapes that make Governors Island a great place to visit all year long.""
As New Yorkers are well aware of now, Governors Island has quickly become a hub for top-notch cultural pursuits and even potential ecological efforts whose effects would impact the city as a whole (case in point: a new climate change center scheduled to open in the area in the near future).

The drink is a créme-based Frappuccino with peach flavor and turquoise sparkles that ""create an enchanting marbling effect,"" according to the announcement. Basically, it's a peaches and cream Frappuccino with sparkles.
On top, you get peach-flavored whipped cream sprinkled with one of the three colors of candy gems. Each color, the announcement says, signifies a different fortune. Whatever that means, you won't have a say in it. Your color will be selected for you by the fates or Miss Cleo or something.
It's not clear what any of this is based on, but the color selected for you has meaning. Blue gems indicate ""you're destined for adventure."" Green means you're going to have a lucky day.

https://www.eater.com/2019/9/16/20868263/mcdonalds-chicken-sandwich-disappoints-again-popeyes-chick-fil-a,Eater,"McDonald’s has tried, desperately, to get into the chicken sandwich game over the past few years. Last year, they introduced a chicken sandwich with pickles on a bun to their dollar menu, a clear attempt to compete with the classic Chick-fil-A sandwich, but it never quite caught on. Neither did their buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich. Clearly, McDonald’s was getting the message they should stick with nuggets because sandwiches aren’t its forte. But in the chicken sandwich renaissance that’s taking over fast food, obviously they tried again, this time with a spicy BBQ chicken sandwich that apparently sucks.
According to a Business Insider taste tester, “It was like McDonald’s slapped two chicken tenders on a bun with some onion slivers and BBQ sauce. I wondered why McDonald’s had even bothered to release it.” While Delish testers said the bun was good, others concluded the BBQ sauce was not spicy at all. And The Takeout says it deserves a “participation trophy,” but that you’d be happier ordering nuggets. And maybe they thought having BBQ sauce would differentiate them from the sea of fried chicken sandwiches, but overall the sandwich has a very dad-trying-to-prove-to-you-he’s-still-with-it vibe. You’re better off just bringing a bun to Popeyes."

After firmly dismissing rumors of a future collaboration with bleeding plant-based burger maker Impossible Foods, Arby’s is now unveiling an extremely feeble marketing tactic: making vegetables out of meat.
The company’s marketing team is calling the new meat-vegetables “megetables,” and has apparently even filed a trademark on the word. God forbid some other brand steal that beautifully constructed mashup! Setting aside the fact that megetables is the worst possible combination of “meat” and “vegetables” (See: meatables, meagies, vegeats), Arby’s chief marketing officer Jim Taylor revealed to Fast Company that it apparently took him three whole months to come up with this gag — an absurd amount of time to devote to a project that seems to amount to a lame joke and an overhead cooking video demonstrating how to make a carrot out of turkey.
Doubling down on the terrible “megetable” wordplay, the place with “The Meats” is calling this cooking tragedy a “marrot,” which once more ignores superior terms like carreat and tarrot. Secondly, it’s only a slivered and sous vide turkey breast covered in dried carrot powder and topped with parsley, meaning it’s not even a meat-based vegetable — it’s a piece of meat made with vegetables.
Fortunately, the turkey carrot is staying in the test kitchen at Arby’s headquarters for now, though the brand isn’t ruling out selling marrots as a limited-time promotion. If this is really the meat lobby’s best jab at plant-based meat, Impossible Foods has nothing to fear."

Their official name is “Pregame,” which tells you everything about the way these baby Four Lokos are meant to be consumed: hard, fast, on your buddy Mike’s stained living room futon surrounded by people who you know you will see fighting a bouncer by the end of the night.
In a time when some college students are getting busted for throwing parties despite the risk of COVID-19 transmission, one might be tempted to ask Four Loko, “Now, really?” But this is a company whose FAQ boasts the question, “Is Four Loko currently banned or illegal anywhere?” (The answer is no.) Its mission is proudly, unrelentingly one of getting people fucked up. For now, that will only be in the Southeast states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee.

Its four parks entail 43 square miles of merriment, and that's plenty of opportunity to enjoy delicious food and drinks and take in all the sights and sounds of what is actually the world's largest theme park.

Travel agency MagicGuides just released an analysis of all of Disney World's rides to help Disney World visitors plan their next trip and ranked the best ones based on three key metrics. The analysis was based on each ride’s number of Instagram hashtags, its Tripadvisor ratings, and its average monthly search volume.
The result? The most popular ride at Disney World is one that is actually shut down right now. That's right, Splash Mountain came out on top. Soon to be reimagined as a The Princess and the Frog-inspired ride called Tiana's Bayou Adventure, the attraction scored well across all three metrics. The closed ride's popularity shouldn't be all that surprising, considering people were buying ""authentic"" water from the ride's last day in operation on eBay earlier this year.
Rounding out the top three were two more perennial Disney World favorites: The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and Space Mountain.
The analysis also shared which attractions were most popular in each state, and Splash Mountain ranked first in 49 states. The lone hold-out was Florida, which preferred Epcot's new Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind ride.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/manhattans-only-dairy-queen-is-permanently-closed-072920,Timeout,"The national chain was a nostalgic favorite for many New Yorkers.
There won’t be any Blizzards in Manhattan this summer.
New York City has no shortage of chain restaurants these days, but while nobody was looking, the only Dairy Queen in Manhattan permanently closed. Time Out confirmed today with the company’s reps that a local franchisee closed the shop on 14th Street near Union Square back in May.
Curiously, there’s only been one operating Dairy Queen in Manhattan even as chains have infiltrated neighborhoods across the five boroughs—Taco Bell, Chik-fil-A and Krispy Kreme to name a few. Currently, there’s a DQ in the Staten Island Ferry Terminal and one in the Bronx.
But when the DQ Chill & Grill opened in May 2014, it garnered lots of attention. New York magazine’s Grub Street blog published a rant titled “Please Don’t Actually Go to Manhattan’s First Dairy Queen” shortly after its debut. Even The New Yorker weighed in about the two-story, 2,500-square-foot space that served frozen desserts and food such as chicken strips and fries. This location opened with its own Blizzard dubbed the Big Apple Blizzard with an apple pie-flavored soft serve mixed in with some Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
Despite being a multi-national chain, Dairy Queen evoked a sense of nostalgia for many New Yorkers (at least the many who didn’t grow up here). Sure, the city is full of fancy, artisanal shops serving ice cream, gelato and soft serve, but whether you grew up in Worcester, Massachusetts, or Winona, Minnesota (the company has headquarters in the Twin Cities), an Oreo Blizzard or strawberry sundae hit the spot.
There’s no word on if another Dairy Queen will open in Manhattan."

Dracula, Edward Cullen and Lestat de Lioncourt would love New York City, according to this new study from LawnLove.com.
According to the site, NYC is apparently the ideal city for vampires because it would have the most potential victims, the most slaughterhouses and the most vampire groups in the U.S. (maybe the Staten Island vampires from What We Do in the Shadows were onto something).
To come up with their ranking, the company looked at cities with plenty of warm bodies, blood centers, and “vampire-friendly” dwellings, that is, casket suppliers and homes with basements. They also even considered deterrents like garlic festivals and sunshine, as well as community and entertainment factors, such as vampire groups, nightlife options, and vampire tours.
While this might be silly to you, NYC has some history with “vampires.” In the 1870s, people used to drink blood collected from slaughterhouses, especially the one on 34th Street by the Hudson River. They’d drink cups of blood, collected straight from the necks of freshly slaughtered steers, according to OZY.com. (They believed the blood could treat all kinds of diseases).

https://www.eater.com/2018/10/24/18015026/halloween-what-is-candy-corn-pumpkin,Eater,"Much like the word “moist” and the music of Nickelback, candy corn is a thing that’s cool to hate. In an article titled “Candy Corn Is Garbage,” Deadspin points to “hobos, serial murderers, and Satan” as the only people who like candy corn; The Takeout, also driven to invoke the devil to describe candy in a candy corn debate, calls it “Satan’s earwax”; Buzzfeed, combining two pariahs in one pithy line, lists “the leftover crumbs stuck in Guy Fieri’s goatee” among things that taste better than candy corn.
But here’s the thing: They’re all wrong. The candy corn hate is a baseless charade that denigrates one of America’s oldest sweets. Most of today’s popular candies came about within the past 100 years, born of candy makers at big corporations looking for a new way to make a buck: Snickers emerged in the 1930s from the massive Mars company; M&M’s came around in the 1940s and were essentially just a copy of some other treat described as “chocolate pellets;” Twix was imported from the Brits in 1979.
Candy corn, on the other hand, has been around since the 19th century, its roots firmly planted in American soil. According to oral history, George Renninger first invented candy corn in the 1880s while working at the Philadelphia-based Wunderle Candy Company, where it went by the names “Butter Cream” and “Chicken Corn.” By the turn of the century, the Goelitz Confectionery Company (now known as the Jelly Belly Candy Company) had begun producing the confections on a larger scale, marketing it as “Chicken Feed” in rooster-adorned packaging.
The corn-kernel shape and poultry-centric positioning was no accident. At the time, farmers made up about half of the American labor force, and companies marketed agriculture-themed products all year long. In fact, lots of candy makers were busy creating similar treats in the shapes of other agrarian tokens, like chestnuts, turnips, and clover leaves, according to The Atlantic. What set candy corn apart was its revolutionary tri-color design: those white, yellow, and orange stripes. Done manually, by men pouring heavy buckets of steaming sugary liquid, the labor-intensive coloring process resulted in a visual excitement no other confection could match.
Gastropod explores how a 2,000-year-old Celtic festival marking the sun’s death morphed into a family-friendly sugar-fest.
It took a while for Chicken Feed, which was marketed year-round (“The candy all children love to nibble on all year long”!) to become associated with Halloween. But when wartime sugar rations lifted in the 1940s and trick-or-treating began to take off, candy corn’s harvest colors and low cost made it the obvious choice to offer at the door. Goelitz took advantage of this shift, dramatically increasing its October advertising and gradually making candy corn a treat that Americans thought of at Halloween, and only Halloween.
Today, the two major candy corn manufacturers — Jelly Belly and Brach’s Candy — use largely the same recipe Wunderle did back in the day (sugar and corn syrup, fondant, confectioner’s wax, and various other additions, like vanilla flavor or marshmallow creme). The main difference is that the laborious hand-pouring process has been taken over by machines, which means that they can produce a lot of candy corn: According to the National Confectioners’ Association, American companies produce 35 million pounds, or 9 billion kernels, annually.
With all the candy corn produced, and the apparent universal disdain for it, something doesn’t add up. One of two things is true: either people are lying about their candy corn opinions, or tons of candy corn gets thrown out each year.
Both options are tragic. The first means that people are hiding their love of candy corn out of societally imposed shame, like when I pretended I thought I Feel Pretty was stupid even though I cried through the whole last third (she found beauty within herself!). The second means that pounds of delicious treats are winding up in the garbage. Fortunately, both can be fixed with one simple solution: a nationwide embrace of the true deliciousness of candy corn.
The notion that candy corn tastes bad is a lie. It’s just not true. Though the primary ingredient is sugar, candy corn’s flavor transcends cloying sweetness, becoming something richer and more nuanced: There’s a nuttiness reminiscent of marzipan, hints of warm vanilla, a buttery flavor belied by the fact that candy corn is, as bags proudly proclaim, a fat-free candy.
Then there’s the texture, something a lot of people cite as their grievance with candy corn. During candy corn production, the sugar crystallizes, giving the kernels a short texture: that means they’re not too chewy, and just a bit crumbly, while holding their shape enough to give a good tooth-sink. This short texture resembles ear wax, or a candle (two common comparisons), only insofar as it has a slightly waxy exterior, created by the confectioner’s wax that gives candy corn its cheerful sheen. But regardless, critics should beware the logical extension of dismissing a food because its texture resembles something else: Do we hate mochi because it has the texture of a rubber ball? Do we revile yogurt because it’s the texture of body lotion? Do we recoil at flourless chocolate cake because it shares a texture with human waste? Leave your texture arguments at the door, please. They’re invalid.
Candy corn also has an evocative aspect, like Proust’s madeleine. It’s one of the few foods truly associated with only one time of year (sure, candy canes are just for Christmas, but they taste like any old mint you grabbed from the hostess stand at a restaurant). Because of this, a bite of candy corn conjures this specific seasonal moment: the anticipatory energy of October, the cozy turning inward of mid-fall. A bite of a Butterfinger makes you remember only that you need to buy more floss.
But I’m not here to denigrate other candies. Other candies are great! Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups are the greatest candy ever made, Snickers truly do satisfy, and even tooth-destroying Butterfingers hold a unique place in my heart. My love for candy corn doesn’t make me an antagonist to America’s most popular treats — and the assumption that it would is at the root of America’s abandonment of candy corn, and, dare I say, many other problems we face today: We seem to have forgotten that we can like one thing without hating another.
Candy corn doesn’t need to be your favorite candy, or even in the top three. But, for your own taste buds, for America’s candy history, to rebut societally imposed candy opinions and reject today’s polarization and vitriol, you should enjoy at least a few kernels. Candy corn tastes great. If you think otherwise, your opinion is wrong."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/harry-potter-forbidden-forest-experience-launches-new-york,Thrillist,"Hogwarts and its magical surroundings might be closer than you think. This fall, you can step into the iconic Forbidden Forest just outside NYC.
""Harry Potter: A Forbidden Forest Experience"" will take over the grounds of Westchester County's Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park for a memorable light trail and village inspired by the beloved Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts series.
Starting October 22, wizard-wannabes will get the chance to walk through mesmerizing lights and installations that will bring to life Harry's wizard world. Throughout the Forbidden Forest path, guests will encounter the forest's very own residents, including hippogriffs, centaurs, unicorns, and even nifflers. It's recommended that you study up, as guests will get the chance to practice casting their very own spells.
The experience, which lasts from 60 to 90 minutes, culminates in a themed village at the end of the trail, where brave wizards and muggles will get the chance to wind down and grab some food and drinks after traversing the forest. Those looking for a souvenir will also be able to find that in the village, which will feature shops offering exclusive products.
Everybody is welcome to participate in the event, and the experience is suitable for all ages. Tickets will be available for purchase from Thursday, August 18 on the event's website, and prices start from $25 for children and $36 for adults.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/classic-landmark-nyc-restaurants-map,Thrillist,"If you're looking to explore NYC's authentic and iconic dining scene but don't know where to start, Reddit might be of help.
Jake Hook, a savvy Reddit user who goes by the username of Easy_Potential2882, decided to put all of the most iconic landmark restaurants, bars, and cafes of the New York City area together on one map. The rules to make it onto their list are simple: it has to be a classic, local-favorite spot, and it needs to have been established before the year 2000.
When Hook first started creating the map around April/May 2020, they were just doing some good old end-of-pandemic daydreaming. They were just trying to come up with a list of all the spots they wanted to hit after the pandemic was over, but it turned out to become something bigger and much more community-centric than that.
""Another reason [why I created the map] is kind of just reacting against gentrification, which is why I limit it to restaurants 20 years or older,"" Hook told Thrillist. ""I want people to have these older places in mind so that they can patronize those establishments [and] keep them in business much longer, because a lot of these restaurants are real centers of community for neighborhoods, boroughs, and the city as a whole.""
A Los Angeles native (they also created a very similar LA map), Hook wanted to make NYC their new community, and felt the need to contribute to it by helping local businesses stay on the radar. To them, landmark local businesses are what give a city its true character, while trendy hotspots don't really encapsulate the city's authentic vibe.
""I wanted to make sure that, in a city I was once unfamiliar with, I would be contributing to a sense of continuity within this city,"" they said. ""Not just looking for all the trendy spots that have equally trendy California equivalents.""
When Hook started working on the project, it took them around two or three months of intensive research, and after that, it's been all about adding and removing entries. Places that have recently closed, old and iconic eateries that Hook hadn't heard of before, and names they just initially forgot about all became part of the creative process. With over 500 locations listed and daily modifications, it feels like there is no end in sight.
Luckily, there are fellow Redditors to help. The comment section of the initial post is flooded by positive feedback, but every few comments, one can find some important tips.
""In Astoria, Zenon Taverna is permanently closed,"" reads one of them. ""But you can add Sanford's on Broadway.""
""Please add: Massawa, 1239 Amsterdam,"" notes another user. ""Been there since '88.""
Hook patiently reviews all the tips, and modifies the map accordingly. They're the main creator, but the map has basically become an endearing NYC community project. It benefits everyone, and it's a grassroots initiative born from the community for the community.
""This is excellent! And the comments here are collaborative,"" reads one of the comments. ""This reminds me of good early internet."""
https://www.thrillist.com/drink/nation/difference-between-lager-vs-ale,Thrillist,"When it comes to talking about beer, there are no two words that get thrown around as much as “ale” and “lager.” This isn’t strange, since all beer falls into at least one of these categories, but many of us have been taken down a road of miseducation when it comes to distinguishing the pair. But fear not: We’re here to help you understand the differences between the two.
Well, despite what lazy marketing from macro-breweries may have you believe, a lager is a broad category of many different styles. It’s okay if you never knew that. Literally billions of dollars have been spent in the process of pushing a strange mix of nonsensical buzzwords into your face that glaze over this fact. None of this is to make you feel like you need to be an expert: It’s just that understanding the distinction between ales and lagers can make it much easier to find a beer you like.
Yeast. Yes, it is really that simple. Ales and lagers are each made using different strains of yeast. Simply put, lagers are brewed using bottom-fermenting strains of yeast held at colder temperatures (around 40-52°F), while ales are brewed with a top fermenting yeast that operates at warmer temperatures (around 55-77°F, usually).
Of course, there’s a little more to it than that. Lager is a noun (which translates from German as “storage”), but it’s also a verb that refers to the cold storage of beer while it ferments. There’s a ton of biochemistry involved in fully understanding it, but suffice to say that lager yeast traditionally require a little more time to brew than ales.
It’s also worth noting the fascinating collision of cell biology, craftsmanship, and overall human civilization that has taken place in brewing. Specific strains have even evolved over time through brewer selection, honing the selection process even more than just picking column A or column B. So if you’re making a saison, it’s not always as easy as just hitting up Amazon for an “ale yeast.” Today, entire companies specialize in propagating entire subcategories of cells for making many specific styles.
Contrary to a weirdly held popular belief, the color or clarity of a beer has nothing to do with its ale or lager classification. There are blonde ales that are as pale as classic Czech pilsners (a lager), and smooth, dark lagers like schwarzbiers that are as opaque and jet black as stouts (an ale). That’s because color in beer is imparted by the malt bill—and in the case of certain recipes, additives like fruits, spices, and other random ingredients—and has nothing to do with the yeast being used.
Unless you consider a 9.5% ABV doppelbock a “low-alcohol beer,” lagers can sometimes make up the strongest beers being offered on a menu.
In so many cases, yes! Ale yeasts produce more esters and phenols during fermentation, which are the byproducts that give beer those non-hop, non-malt driven flavors. If you’re wondering what that means, think about the last time you had a spicy, fruity Belgian ale that smelled of cloves and pepper, or a German hefeweizen that tasted like ripe banana and bubblegum, or an English ale that had perfumed, floral stewed fruit flavors. This is in stark contrast from the clean, crisp, rounded flavors and aromas of beer fermented with lager yeast.
With beer, there are always exceptions to the rule. Some pretty famous styles can be considered hybrids of the two. Kölsch and altbier, for example, are made using ale yeast that is fermented at lager temperatures. California common lager (or “steam beer,” if you’re down with the proprietary name that was copyrighted by Anchor Brewing Company) is an American-born style that involves lager yeast brewed at ale temperatures. This middle ground can be a pretty friendly place if you know what you’re doing—kind of a best of both worlds situation.
Lagers have a history that has deep German and Bavarian roots, so it can help to think of an area when trying to remember the categories. Besides that, pilsners, adjunct lagers (think big brewery beers made with lots of rice and corn), schwarzbiers, bock, doppelbock, and Vienna lagers are all prime examples. Ales are more traditionally linked with Belgium and Great Britain, so think IPAs, stouts, pale ales, brown ales, saisons, dubbels, tripels, and quads. Of course, the world is a small place these days and you can brew a saison as easily in Phoenix as you can Flanders, so never make assumptions based on where a beer is coming from.
The point is the distinction is important only to get a better understanding of what you already like. So take this as an excuse to go hit up your favorite local beer bar or shop and do some homework."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/where-the-northern-lights-were-seen-after-cannibal-cme,Thrillist,"Seeing the northern lights is magical. It sounds cheesy, but it's true. It's the reason there are entire vacation packages geared toward trying to see them and why there are people who chase them over and over and over.
In most instances, you're going to need to travel to the northern reaches of the globe to see them. Alaska. Sweden. Iceland. Russia. If you're lucky, you've caught them in the Northern US after a fairly significant solar event. However, the night of November 3, the aurora borealis ""spread almost to Los Angeles,"" according to spaceweather.com, which shared photos from aurora chaser Hongming Zheng in Lincoln, California, just north of Sacramento.
This delightful sight was the result of a series of solar outbursts that started on November 1. ""The sun has produced several coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are bubbles of hot gas and magnetic field; while such activity can come from any part of the sun, the current examples have headed out into space toward Earth, making them of particular interest to humans,"" says Space.com. Some have called the latter of these CMEs a ""cannibal CME"" as it overtook earlier ones as they raced toward Earth.
The result was people around the globe getting an impressive view of the northern lights. That included it being seen much further south than it is generally seen and impressive displays at northern latitudes with pink glow amidst the familiar green aura.
It was even strong enough to be visible at sunrise in Absiko, Sweden, per Spaceweather.com. Aurora photographer Oliver Wright, who previously offered tips on photographing Comet Neowise to Thrillist, told the site, ""I woke up just after 5 am, and I could see auroras through my bedroom window. So, quick coffee and headed down to the bridge over the Abisko canyon. I was watching purple auroras getting washed out by the nautical sunrise. I've only ever seen that once before during the Saint Patrick Day geomagnetic storm of 2015.""
The storm is still underway at the time of publication, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) posting a G2 watch that is in effect from 5-8 pm ET the night of November 4. ""If these conditions persist,"" writes Spaceweather.com, ""observers in Scandinavia, Iceland, Canada, and maybe even northern-tier US states can expect to see auroras after nightfall on November 4.""
As always, though, it's difficult to predict when you'll see the northern lights. The latest CME produced wowing displays, but a similar forecast last week failed to produce aurora sightings as far south as was forecast to be possible.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/an-enormous-new-electronic-music-club-just-opened-on-the-lower-east-side-112122,Timeout,"Virgo hopes to bring house music to Manhattan.
Although the appeal of a giant nightclub has always been a bit lost on us, we must admit there’s something about dancing to loud music surrounded by a horde of strangers that some New Yorkers absolutely adore—which is why we’re not surprised to hear about the opening of a new club in the heart of the Lower East Side.
Dubbed Virgo, the 3,000-square-foot electronic music destination at 324 Grand Street by Orchard Street isn't only noteworthy because of its focus on deep house music, a genre that many New Yorkers think hasn't received as much attention as it deserves in recent years, but exciting because of its investment in a state-of-the-art sound system that was actually imported from the United Kingdom.
Virgo's location was also a deliberate choice, hoping to help New Yorkers enjoy house music in Manhattan without having to travel to Brooklyn, where destinations of the sort are more prevalent at the moment.
""Unlike Brooklyn, Lower Manhattan hasn't had a great lounge in electronic, house and disco in recent years,"" said co-founder Thatcher Shultz in an official statement. ""Now that the city's consumers have developed a taste for these genres, Virgo offers them a premium music and nightlife experience around them.""
Decor-wise, expect three infinity mirror installations that call out to the same aesthetic as the music genre that the space is devoted to, plus custom LED lighting walls and a purple concrete bar that matches the teal upholstery. There's also a separate shag-carpeted ""Boiler Room"" where DJs will get to play different music through an independent audio system that's hooked to the back of the venue.
As for the Virgo's moniker, it's a nod to Shultz's zodiac sign. Sometimes, a simple name goes a long way."
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/any-thing-is-a-new-bar-in-prospect-lefferts-gardens-bringing-the-fun-073120,Timeout,"The bar is attached to Mo’s Original and comes from an owner of Glady’s.
A new bar called Any Thing has opened in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. It is attached to Mo’s Original, the Caribbean-inflected ramen bar from William Garfield (an owner of Glady’s in Crown Heights) and Amanda Bender (who also worked at Glady’s). Any Thing first opened on March 13th and only had two days it was open for service before it was forced to close due to the pandemic. Now, the bar is back in action and eager to introduce its cocktail program to the neighborhood.
Bender tells Time Out New York that during their initial opening, the focus of the cocktails was on “these crazy, wacky cocktails that made you feel like you were in a different dimension,” but since the pandemic they’ve shifted their menu by consulting with their kitchen staff and bartenders about how they could make the space “feel more at home” with a more comfort-focused menu to reflect that. They’ve since added their take on Sex on the Beach called “Sex in Prospect Park” and a take on a Long Island Iced Tea, in addition to more “out-there” combinations. Bender says this call and response, working with the community to figure out what they actually need right now is something that she hopes continues for the long run. Most cocktails hover on the $11 or under price range—increasingly rare for NYC where cocktails can go up to an eye-popping $22 at its most luxurious—and drinks include a yuzu-lemon fizz (which can be made sans alcohol), a spicy margarita with tangerine and a frozen banana liqueur drink, among many others. Food is provided by the shared Mo's Original kitchen.
Bender was committed to making the bar shelves filled only by women-owned, distilled and/or supported spirits to bring more equity. “It was a process that was honestly shamefully difficult. As a woman I feel very underrepresented behind the bar, there just aren’t as many women represented in these distilleries and at tastings I’d experienced,” she says. When she worked at Gladys’ she worked alongside her friend and colleague Shannon Mustipher, the restaurant-bar’s beverage director. “I would like that commitment to women to stem beyond just the bottles at Any Thing. I’d like as many women bartenders behind the bar as possible and DJs, when we’re allowed to have people in the space like that again,” she says.
Throughout its seven-year run, Glady's became a neighborhood institution in Crown Heights for its Caribbean food (and tropical cocktail menu that catapulted beverage director Mustipher to being one of the prominent figures of the city’s cocktail scene). Due to the financial stressors of COVID-19 and their landlord’s unwillingness to give relief, the team heartbreakingly was forced to shutter its doors last month. ""We just had to throw our hands up in the air,"" says Bender. Michael Jacober was the original owner of Glady’s, which he sold to William Garfield in recent years but neither Jacober or Mustipher is involved in Mo’s Original or Any Thing. Now Garfield and Bender are committed to focusing on Mo’s and Any Thing, who, Bender tells us, have landlords that were much more empathetic to their situation.
“It’s been really nice getting to know our neighbors and getting to know that community, and to have a diverse menu and not be forced to have insane prices right now,” she says. You can order cocktails to-go or sit at their outdoor patio.
Any Thing bar at Mo's Original is located at 453 Rogers Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11225."
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/leland-eating-and-drinking-house,Timeout,"“I’m so glad I know this is in the neighborhood,” a friend said midway through dinner at Leland Eating and Drinking House recently, before predicting how much money he’d eventually spend over the course of future visits. The restaurant, which briefly operated last December before fully opening in February, makes it easy to imagine return trips. It’s an easy place to be.
For one, the corner spot is comfortable, divided into two dining areas. Enter from the Dean Street side and the bar is to your left with a long, pale wood banquette and tables to your right. Farther back and down a few stairs, another dining room is closer to the kitchen and looks out on Underhill Avenue. Both spaces have big windows and lots of white oak. When a protagonist is a chef/owner at an unseen restaurant in a Nancy Meyers movie, the restaurant probably looks like this.
The menu is divided, too, split into three sections. Most of the snacks and plates could just as accurately be called appetizers, and the large plates entrées. Order any combination and you’ll look like you know what you’re doing. Everything here makes sense.
The choppy smoked steelhead trout rillette ($9) is a fun presentation. Served in a jar with crispy za’atar potato chips it’s emblematic of the restaurant overall: good and unfussy and apparently effortless. You don’t worry about how to best divide it however many ways—there’s a pile of potato chips, just keep loading them up until it’s gone! This is also one of the dishes we’ve thought about the most since visiting, the typically mild fish variety pleasantly richer than expected with a saline current. It tastes like something you’d have at a dockside picnic on the first cool day of summer.
The mussels ($18) are one exception to the plates-are-apps rule. Filling a large skillet, they could easily stand for a main. They’re also an example of how Leland exceeds expectations for what’s typically categorized as a “neighborhood restaurant.” We’d never anticipate anything approaching perfection from such a place, just tasty enough food and a good enough time. But Leland’s charred lemon mussels in a shallow broth with a perky citrus pop have every indication of the preparation we would expect at a much more expensive restaurant striving to justify its price tag. Each gleaming onyx shell seemed to be open to the same degree, each with a uniformly plump interior. It’s a studied offering with ideal execution.
Other highlights among the smaller plates include crispy pollock fritters over horseradish tzatziki ($9) that you could call elevated bar food, and the mushrooms and sourdough ($15), which tops thick pieces of toast with tender mushrooms in cream, thyme, garlic and ginger.
Leland is not explicitly a seafood restaurant, it just happens to do seafood particularly well. Its large plates include a salt-citrus brined half chicken ($26) and a nicely prepared sliced grilled pork chop ($34). But the whole fish ($32)–a lovely, lightly fried scup–is a standout, the variety sometimes called porgy enlivened by a glancing, near-sweetness and caramelized flavor and texture.
A decent selection of beer and wine are available from the bar, in addition to a brief cocktail list. Tabled together, the J Bomb, which layers a barely bitter icy negroni over frozen margarita base and the Cider House, with a palm-sized apple slice in a rye, lemon and maple seem to nod goodbye this season’s weeks of heart and humidity and break into the fall to come.
We’re so glad to know that Leland Eating and Drinking House in our friend’s neighborhood, even though it isn’t in ours. But we’re already imagining return trips, in any case.
Leland Eating and Drinking House is located at 755 Dean Street and is open from 1pm-4pm Wednesday-Friday, 10am-4pm Saturday and Sunday, 5pm-10pm Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday, 5pm-11pm Friday and Saturday, and 4-5pm Wednesday-Sunday."

Using Google Trends, career site Zippia compiled a ranking of each state's favorite snacks and that whole ""one man's trash is another man's treasure"" phrase has never been more fitting.
The platform examined 45 different snack foods and determined which states had the biggest fans. See the map and list below to determine whether you're more of an Alaska, Hawaii, New York, or Wisconsin.
""Sweet wins over salty -- 29 states’ favorite snack is sweet,"" Zippia asserts in its findings.

You have a lot of snacking to do, so start simple: Post up at the bar and pair your tipple of choice with the kale salad ($6), which tempers the greens’ bite with chunks of Red Delicious apple and a citrus vinaigrette, or the roasted beets ($8), delicately dressed with Greek yogurt, balsamic vinegar and fresh tarragon. For a more shareable option, try a few orders of the deviled duck eggs (two halves for $4). Tue–Wed, Sun until 2am, Thu–Sat until 4am.
Co-owners and siblings Jacqueline and Fabrizio Pirolo drew on European influences as much as their Italian heritage to craft a menu that offering something for every palate. You can’t go wrong with any of the affordable small plates at this sibling-run establishment, but we find ourselves most often returning to the creamy polenta with spicy sausage ($10), warm butternut squash ($11) and homemade cavatelli with pork sugo ($15). The kitchen’s rendition of patatas bravas ($7), supremely crispy fingerlings served with sriracha and mayo, is also compulsively craveable. Mon‑Thu until midnight; Fri, Sat until 1am.
We hope you saved room for grilled cheese, because this whiskeycentric tavern serves seven different varieties. The Karen ($7) pairs fromage blanc, Gruyère, sharp cheddar and Havarti on sourdough; the rich Maefred ($6) combines gooey double-crème Brie with local mushrooms, diced onions and fresh rosemary on ciabatta. Nightly until 4am.
Forgo the usual meat-and-cheese plates and turn your attention to the Vittles section of the menu at this chic but low-key neighborhood spot. Pigs-in-a-blanket get punched up with large hunks of spicy Italian sausage ($7), and bacon-wrapped dates swap out standard blue or Gorgonzola cheese for melty Gouda ($7). If you’re craving something sweet and haven’t yet had your fill of cheese-and-toasted–bread combos, the pressed sandwich with Nutella and goat’s-milk ricotta ($6) balances its fillings just right. Otherwise, go for the chocolate panna cotta ($6), an enhanced riff on the creamy, puddingesque dessert that tops the custard with house-made huckleberry jam and a sprinkling of sea salt. Nightly until 4am.
Billyburg brunchers turn this cash-only bistro into Wait Central on weekends, but the after-hours atmosphere tends to be more manageable. The best spots to perch are at the polished wooden bar and in the back room, where friends can gather around an old-timey hearth in winter. You can sample classic hors d’oeuvres regardless of when you’re there or where you sit, including house-made duck pâté ($11) and escargots ($9). And if you ask us, a side of thin, parsley-speckled pommes frites ($4.50) is always a good idea. Those who’ve managed to work off some of the earlier nibbles might have room for one of Le Barricou’s French classics, such as a rib-sticking version of coq au vin ($15), but we’d recommend saving that for another day—or night. Mon–Thu, Sun until midnight; Fri, Sat until 2am."

In typical Target fashion, the store offers just about anything shoppers might be looking for. Over 100 team members will be available to help customers navigate through the store's many departments, which feature a long list of Target's top owned and national brands.
Guests can shop for essentials, beauty, personal care, and home goods, and those looking for a snack will be able to grab something from the food and beverage aisles.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/chuck-e-cheese-recycled-pizza-slices-conspiracy,Thrillist,"Far be it from us to assume anything about you, but it's hard to imagine you've ever visited a Chuck E. Cheese's just to eat the pizza. It's not exactly known for its food so much as it is for its children's arcade reigned by a literal band of creepy animatronic rodents. Still, you'd probably want to know if the pizzas they're serving are actually just cobbled together using reheated pieces from discarded pies, right? Well, that's the latest rumor milling around the internet, and we're here to break it all down for you.
For years, there have been whispers on the web that the pizzas at Chuck E. Cheese's are actually made by piecing together uneaten slices from other pies. It's a truly bizarre theory, but it's one that picked up steam again this past week after YouTuber Shane Dawson released a video to investigate the claim. To get to the bottom of it, he ordered a pizza at two different CEC locations, and they both came out looking a bit... strange. Specifically, the edges of the slices didn't seem to match up, which seems to add credence to the notion that the folks behind the scenes aren't actually serving fresh pies so much as recycling and reheating what's left from ones they've already served and presenting them as new.
To be clear, the folks at Chuck E. Cheese's were quick to deny the claims. In a statement to The Verge, representatives characterized the rumors as ""unequivocally false."" Further, they explained the misshapen and seemingly mismatched slices as simply a byproduct of their freshness.
""No conspiracies here -- our pizzas are made to order and we prepare our dough fresh in restaurant, which means that they’re not always perfectly uniform in shape, but always delicious,” the company spokesperson said.
Dawson's video essentially aimed to validate a rumor that's rumbled for years. For instance, in a Yahoo Answers forum from a full decade ago, someone posed the question of whether Chuck E. Cheese's recycled its pizza. The thing is, there didn't seem to be any evidence to support the hypothesis then, and there doesn't seem to be any evidence now, despite what the pizzas may look like when they arrive at the table. While some took to Twitter to share photos of weird looking pizzas they'd been served over the years at CEC, former employees also jumped to the chain's defense.
One former employee who spoke to Buzzfeed thinks the rumors are funny, but wholly false.
""In my years there, not once did I ever see a pizza even make it back towards the kitchen. They were always thrown in the trash even if it was a pizza that went untouched by the guests,"" she said. She also explained that the cutting tool used to slice the pies may be the culprit, in addition to the fact that the dough shrinks into weird shapes when it's in the oven.
""When it goes through the oven, the pizza shrinks. It warps and depending on the amount of cheese or toppings there is variation in the size and shape, hence why the slices aren’t always the same length,"" she said.
So relax and enjoy that misshapen Chuck E. Cheese's pie without fear -- it's probably fine."
https://www.eater.com/22229648/twitter-responds-to-subways-new-protein-bowls-cold-cuts-no-bread,Eater,"Feast your eyes on cornucopias of salami, turkey, and pepperoni — no bread (or joy) in sight!
At this point, pretty much every fast-casual restaurant has a protein bowl on its menu and now Subway is getting in on the action. While protein bowls are often geared towards the health-conscious or those looking to pack a convenient meal into an easy-to-consume format, the sandwich chain is taking a different, decidedly ’90s Atkins diet approach, offering bowls that are essentially deconstructed sandwiches without the bread. Imagine the deli tray from the last school event you attended (whatever the year), add iceberg lettuce, and voila, you have a Subway protein bowl.
Seeing photos of the newly launched, cursed bowls — which the chain assures customers are here to stay — one can’t help but spiral as the questions pile up: Why use a mound of salami and pepperoni sitting atop unseasoned cucumbers and shredded lettuce as a stylized menu photo? Aren’t these protein bowls just a more aggressive version of a Subway salad, something that already exists, albeit served on a plate? Why did I just spend 15 minute looking at pictures of this meatball tray?
A spokesperson for the chain, speaking with Nation’s Restaurant News, explained that “guests are able to build any Footlong into a protein bowl with the same portion of protein, vegetables, cheese and sauce, just without the bread.” This might be a relief for folks who were turned off of Subway when the Irish Supreme Court ruled that the chain’s bread is too high in sugar to be considered… bread. The bowls, which arrive alongside a new celebrity partnership with pro football player Marshawn Lynch, are also likely to appeal to those following keto or paleo diets, which remain massively popular in the United States despite doctors and diet experts warning of potential health risks.
Maybe it’s the lack of rice or other grain that leaves so much to be desired from these bowls. Or maybe it’s the fact that the chain is trying to sell me the very same struggle meals I make for myself when I haven’t gone grocery shopping in two weeks and can’t rationalize ordering takeout for a 17th night. A bowl of mashed up canned tuna and some lettuce? Sure! Turkey cold cuts and some olives from the back of the fridge? Smother it in thousand island dressing! Why! Not! But you can’t convince me that paying for Subway’s deconstructed spicy Italian sandwich is worth it, no matter what the cost. If I’ve made the trip to Subway, and for some reason decide not to get aforementioned meatball tray, then I’ll be taking my pile of cold cuts on extremely sweet bread, thanks!
Another user tweeted at Subway that when they tried to order a protein bowl, the employee behind the counter said he didn’t actually know how to make one. Perhaps it’s better that way."
https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/burger-delivery-takeout-in-nyc,Theinfatuation,"A burger is greater than the sum of its parts, and it’s what you order when you want to eat with your hands after a particularly long day. When you’re in the mood a patty between two buns and nothing else will do, order from one of the 31 places on this guide.
If you haven’t had their burger, you’re missing out on one of the key parts of the Peter Luger experience. The thick dry-aged beef patty is good enough to eat by itself with a fork, but you should still add a giant slab of bacon. Check Peter Luger’s website for pickup and delivery options.
The backyard burger at Strangeways tastes like something your uncle would grill on a Sunday afternoon. It’s nothing too fancy, but the dry-aged patty comes covered in a cascading layer of sharp cheddar cheese that pairs well with its nicely charred edges. With just lettuce, onion, and special sauce, this burger will bring you back to the basics in the best way possible.
The West Village is full of bars where you can get a burger, but The Happiest Hour still manages to stand out. Their double-stacked burger—which comes covered in melted cheese and special sauce—is exactly what you want to eat while sitting on your couch at home.
Only served at lunch and brunch, Upland’s burger tastes like what would happen if the In-N-Out Double Double started going to CrossFit, got jacked, and decided to top itself with avocado and peppers. The whole thing is basically a love letter to California, complete with a tiny state flag at the top of the toothpick that holds everything together.
For the most ideal burger proportions, look no further than BK Jani in Williamsburg. The thick patty, slice of grilled tomato, chutney, and yogurt all add a ton of flavor without overwhelming one another. This is one of our favorite burgers in NYC, and it’s available for takeout or delivery any day but Monday.
The burger, which comes with thick-cut fries, at this Clinton Hill is very good on its own— but there are a couple things you can add to make it even better. The optional cheddar, for example, and a few slices of crispy bacon . Place your order any day of the week by calling 347-763-2537.
Four burgers with a side of cheese fries is a typical order at White Mana in Jersey City. That’s because the thin smash burgers at this classic diner—which originally opened at the 1939 World’s Fair—are only slightly larger than sliders. They’re $1.80 each, so four of them with a side of cheese fries will cost you less than $12. You can order at the takeaway window daily or place an order for pick up here.
BECs aren’t burgers, so they don’t really belong on this guide, but you should absolutely order the raclette-covered version that comes on a milk bun at Win Son Bakery. We should also mention that the double smash cheeseburger at this Taiwanese spot in Williamsburg is similarly fantastic, and it’s available on the evening menu from 9-10pm Tuesday through Sunday.
This Williamsburg American spot has one of the longest delivery menus we’ve seen, with a bunch of different sections devoted to burgers. These burgers range from a simple version on brioche to a bacon-covered patty with nutella sandwiched between two deep-fried waffles. They’re all available for takeout and delivery until 12am or later every day except Tuesday.
You won’t find ketchup or mustard on the burgers at this Mott Haven beer garden, and you won’t miss them either. That’s because the burgers here are topped with condiments like onion jam and cheddar or sweet plantains and gandule paste. Order one for takeout or delivery, available daily until 11pm.
This spot is Permanently Closed.
Along with voluntarily going to the dentist and getting your own Netflix account, few things provide a sense of adulthood like setting a table for one and topping it with nothing but a bottle of wine and a steaming hot cheeseburger. Dim your lights, maybe light a candle, and order a dry-aged burger from Concord Hill in Williamsburg.
It might be tough to tell where the special sauce on the burger here ends and the horseradish cheddar cheese begins. It also might be difficult to pick up on all seven types of cheese in this Harlem spot’s bacon mac and cheese. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try. Wednesday through Sunday, call 212-678-6200 for takeout, or place an order for delivery online.
It’s good that you know you want a burger. Because if you start perusing the menu at Mekelburg’s without a clear idea of what you’re looking for, you might just end up with hot chicken, caviar-topped baked potatoes, and babka bread pudding. You should definitely order all of those things, but don’t forget the dry-aged cheeseburger with tarragon mustard.
Kimchi mayo is a cheat code that guarantees success. Nowon understands this, and they lather this sauce onto a juicy, charred double cheeseburger made with dry-aged steak. Order the burger for pickup or delivery from this East Village Korean spot, and add honey butter tater tots or chopped cheese rice cakes as a side.
We tend to go with a double shack with fries, but there’s no right or wrong way to order a burger from Shake Shack. There is, however, a wrong way to end your order, and that’s by not getting a shake.
If you’ve been to Katz’s 100 times, there’s a decent chance that you’ve eaten 100 Katz’s pastrami sandwiches. That’s understandable, but it’s also a shame because this LES institution serves a great burger. It’s extremely rich and fatty and doesn’t need anything aside from some house pickles, which you should order on the side.
Tom’s is a diner, and, like most diners, its menu is about as long as an Atlantic think piece. It includes an entire section of burgers that run the gamut from a standard hamburger to a pizza burger with mozzarella and tomato sauce. This Prospect Heights classic is best known for breakfast, which they deliver all day, so consider adding a side of pancakes to whichever burger you choose.
The Ascolana olives at this all-day Italian spot in Carroll Gardens are deep-fried and stuffed with minced meats—and they’re some of our favorite drinking snacks in Brooklyn. Good things happen when you put those olives into a three-meat burger and serve that burger with provolone, bacon, and caramelized onions on a pretzel bun.
Blue Collar serves the kind of food you’d usually eat while watching someone in a white paper cap flip patties and tell stories about the old days. Order this Bushwick spot’s tater tots, chicken tenders, and smash burgers with American cheese.
All seven Westville locations are offering takeout and delivery all day long. In other words, you can use this American spot as the default choice for all kinds of situations, like when you’re in the mood for a very good burger and fries.
The classic burger at Harlem Shake comes with two patties, cheese, pickles, onions, and sauce. It’s already quite a bit of food, especially for $7, but that’s only the beginning. You can customize your burger with toppings ranging from extra patties and jerk mayo to  pickled cherry pepper and bacon relish. However far down that path you decide to go, make sure to finish your order—for pickup or delivery—with a shake.
Deciding between the burger and buffalo wings at Bonnie’s is like choosing between Ryan Gosling in Drive and Ryan Gosling in La La Land. They’re different moods, but you generally want both. If you don’t feel like adding to the growing mound of leftovers in your fridge, just get the Bonnie’s Burger, which comes with roasted peppers and buffalo sauce.
We have no idea how many potential burger permutations there are at this Upper East Side spot, but figuring it out would probably require several hours in front of a blackboard. Choosing the type of patty and how you want it cooked are simple enough actions, but then things get more complicated. Do you want a challah bun? How about American or ghost pepper cheese? Wasabi aioli or spicy mango chutney? A fried egg? If all of that seems overwhelming, just go with one of the specialty burgers, which are available for takeout or delivery until 9:45pm daily.
Queens Bully does meat very well. That goes for this Forest Hills spot’s slow-cooked BBQ, which is available in sandwich form on the delivery menu, and also for its burgers. Keep things simple with the classic Bully Burger, or remind yourself that you’re ordering from a BBQ spot with the Kew Burger, which is topped with house bacon and barbecue sauce.
This place sounds like a haberdashery you’d find on your way to the Catskills, but it’s actually a small bar on the Upper East Side that does a few simple things really well. One of those things is mac and cheese, and another is a thick, juicy burger served on an english muffin. Order both. They’re available for takeout or delivery by calling the restaurant at 212-249-0069.
You always know what you’re going to get with The Smith, and that’s OK, because what you get is always good, and the burger is no exception. Their juicy bacon cheeseburger has an ideal meat-to-bun ratio and comes with a giant mound of thin, salty fries on the side. Order it for takeout or delivery.
Walker’s is a casual neighborhood bar that people who live around Tribeca typically use as a pitstop between the office and the couch. Their eight-ounce sirloin burger is available for pick-up or delivery on their website.
Toad Style serves three different rich, messy cheeseburgers. But what sets this Bed-Stuy spot apart is the fact that the food here is 100% vegan. Their burgers are made with mushroom-and-lentil patties, topped with things like avocado and cashew-dill cheese.
Paul’s in the East Village offers more than 20 types of burgers, which range from a classic half-pounder with pickles and onions to a version topped with ham and mushrooms that resembles a deconstructed western omelette. All but two cost less than $10, and they’re available for delivery or pickup until 11:30pm every day (midnight on Fridays and Saturdays).
Charlie’s serves high-end bar food in Mott Haven, and they offer a particularly delicious bacon cheeseburger topped with a mound of caramelized onions. Get it for delivery or takeout for $15.

But unfortunately most bosses aren’t that great and most people don’t love their jobs. But, one of the factors you might not even realize is affecting your life as a worker is the city you live in.
A new study from LLC.org ranked the best and worst cities for workers, based on eight factors: ""average hours worked per week, average commute time, percentage of workers who commute before 7 am, percentage of workers who are not able to work remotely, single-income families, income growth rate, percentage of employees without health insurance and each city’s crime rate.""
Based on these factors, the five most stressful cities for workers are Houston, Texas; Arlington, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Memphis, Tennessee; and Las Vegas, Nevada. Meanwhile the five least stressful cities are Madison, Wisconsin; Fort Collins, Colorado; Fremont, California; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Providence, Rhode Island.
None of the top or bottom five hold the distinction for longest commute. That honor goes to New York City, which boasts an average commute of 79.6 minutes.

https://www.thrillist.com/lifestyle/chicago/remembering-zero-gravity-the-suburban-teen-dance-club-nobody-wants-to-remember,Thrillist,"When we first got word that Zero Gravity, Chicagoland’s sophisticated young adult dance club of choice, was passing on, quite frankly I was shocked. Shocked not because it was passing on, but, well... shocked that it was actually still alive all this time.
In its 21 years on earth, Zero Gravity managed to touch all of us in various ways, much like the creepy older men that somehow managed to sneak into the club every weekend. Whether you were someone who visited often in your best “Italia” wifebeater along with your girlfriend Magdalina -- who dressed to impress in her best Victoria’s Secret corset, furry boots, and body glitter -- or whether you avoided the club after hearing that rumor about the infected hypodermic needle, which was most likely made up by a suburban mom to deter her kids from visiting, one thing is clear: each and every one of us suburbanite kids was impacted by the existence of Zero Gravity.
Born in 1995, Zero Gravity quickly brandished the title of “Chicago’s No. 1 Dance Club” -- quite the feat considering, first, the club is located a considerable distance outside of Chicago and, second, there’s no way there’s an award for that. By the late nineties, ZG became the toast of Naperville, frequently spotted with local celebrities such as The Killer Bee from B96.
Even more legendary than the steady stream of D-List celebrities that passed through Zero Gravity were its stripper poles, dance cages, and foam parties -- some of which, bizarrely, featured a mechanical bull. However, when mechanical bulls weren’t readily available, ZG’s big-time celebrity hosts were ready and willing to improvise, coming up with creative ways for bikini-clad teenage girls to simulate riding a bull. That’s just the kind of club this was.
""The first and only time I ever went to Zero Gravity was for a foam party. It was also the first time that I saw people doing finger stuff in public. Me and the eight lifeguards I worked with got hopped up on Red Bull and No Doz then crammed into my mom's Volvo and drove up from Plainfield. I think one person had fun.""
In its waning years, many of us became quite concerned about Zero Gravity’s well-being. It quickly became clear to us that the daunting prospect of turning 21 paired with the effects of years of bass, screaming teenage girls, and rave enhancers had taken their toll on the club. The shine began to fade from the club’s steel stripper poles, and not even ZG’s blinding strobe lights were enough to obscure the genetic material left behind on booth seats by generations of young suburbanites.
Like a heavily medicated aging sex symbol desperately clinging to its youth, the promoters began making delusional statements such as, “Zero Gravity is known to be the upper class dance club!” and acting erratically, hosing willing patrons down with fluorescent paint. When Zero Gravity began charging patrons $20 admission and referring to itself as “The #1 Club in the Midwest,” friends knew the non-stop party was going to stop.
Ultimately, Zero Gravity sacrificed it’s base of operation so that its legacy could live on in the form of a brand-new retirement home. We can only assume the retirement home will house some ZG’s original patrons, offering up weekly foam parties in lieu of sponge baths, and a revolving rec room where all residents may gather to copulate under the cover of a fog machine. Resident DJ Markski will be mixing it up (Euro style) every Sunday night all the way ‘til 4am because there’s no school on Monday!
Whether you were someone like one-time friend Becky who never actually made it inside because her friend drank too much and puked in the parking lot, or whether you were more like lifelong friend Stanislav, who spent so much time at the club that his only response was, “Aren’t we all ashamed of what the things we did over a decade ago?”, Zero Gravity touched each and every one of our lives. And those of us that visited before the dawn of social media are eternally grateful that our horrid club photos will never surface on Reddit or The Dirty.
RIP Zero Gravity, 1995 - 2016. Your foam parties, movable dance floor, and orange patrons will live on in our hearts forever.

The final leg of Louis Vuitton's much chronicled traveling exhibit ""200 Trunks, 200 Visionaries"" has officially been activated in New York at the former Madison Avenue flagship of Barneys, where it will stay through December 31.
Previously on display in Paris, Singapore and Los Angeles, the show seeks to honor the designer's iconic trunks, which he started making at the young age of 16, while also celebrating the house's 200th birthday.
To do so, organizers have set up a variety of installations and interactive experiences that dissect the history of the label. In total, expect to look through 200 custom-made and personalized trunks made by a variety of figures, some Vuitton's own collaborators (Marc Jacobs, Supreme) and others by unrelated visionaries (Gloria Steinem, Brooklyn Balloons).
Standout trunks include ones by music curator and DJ Benji B, who turned his creation into a soundproof music studio with a vintage-looking jukebox smack-dab in the middle of it. Ticket holders will get to choose to listen to songs from a roster that includes 200 picks inside of the space.
Architect Peter Marino, on the other hand, decided to pay homage to Vuitton's connection to magician Harry Houdini (who can forget the time the designer challenged Houdini to escape from a locked Vuitton trunk?) by, according to an official statement, ""[creating] a trunk that even Harry Houdini could not get out of.""
Once the show closes, the products on display will be be auctioned off by Sotheby's and all proceeds will be donated to charity.
In addition to the various cultural and fashion-related spaces within the four floors that comprise the experience, visitors will also be able to satisfy their hunger pangs at limited-time restaurant Freds x Louis. As a reminder, Fred's was the popular restaurant that used to reside inside of Barneys before the legendary department store closed down about three years ago.
The exhibit at 660 Madison Avenue by 61st Street is completely free to access and runs daily from 10am through 8pm. Guests are encouraged to book timed visits right here."
https://www.eater.com/2019/2/12/18222320/chuck-e-cheeses-pizza-conspiracy-reddit,Eater,"Pizza arcade chain Chuck E. Cheese’s is defending itself from an internet conspiracy theory that alleges the company creates whole pizzas by Frankensteining together uneaten slices from other pizzas.
The theory was propagated online this week by YouTube personality Shane Dawson. In his video, Dawson investigates the claim by visiting a Chuck E. Cheese’s location and ordering two pizzas, both of which come out with weird mismatched edges. One pizza — half pepperoni, half plain cheese — appears to be two different pizzas sliced in half and pushed together to resemble a whole pie. Dawson goes on to heavily imply that the pizzas aren’t in fact fresh pies made from one ball of dough and one bake, as one would assume a newly ordered pizza would be at a reputable slice joint, but reused slices from other pizzas that have been reheated and reformed into a circular pie.
The theory was roundly denied by representatives of Chuck E. Cheese’s, who characterized the idea as “unequivocally false” in statements to the Verge and Buzzfeed. “No conspiracies here — our pizzas are made to order and we prepare our dough fresh in restaurant, which means that they’re not always perfectly uniform in shape, but always delicious,” a company spokesperson said.
Still, the debate rages on: Why the hell do these pizzas look so consistently weird? Dawson isn’t entirely wrong. There is a lot of visual evidence of Chuck E. Cheese’s pizzas with irregular slices.
But there are also plenty of examples that look perfectly round.
Rumors about the origins of Chuck E. Cheese’s aberrant pizza shapes have been around for years. At least two Yahoo! Answers threads posed the question 10 years ago and received a handful of (mostly disgusted) responses.
As a national chain with more than 600 locations worldwide and presumably thousands of employees over its 39 years of existence, it seems it would be difficult to keep that secret quiet for long. A seven-month-old Reddit discussion involving self-identified former Chuck E. Cheese employees, for example, doesn’t mention a conspiracy to repurpose used pizza, though it does mention a lot of other gross situations that only an insider would know.
In light of Dawson’s wide-reaching video, former employees have also popped up on Twitter, Reddit, and the other chatty corners of the internet to refute the claims.
As one r/conspiracytheories commenter mlball98 points out, the bizarre shapes of the slices is more attributable to the speed the staff are working at to cut the pizzas. “We hand cut all of the pizzas. We have to do it fast because we usually have 5 more coming out right behind it. I’ve seen millions of pizzas cut and they always look a little off, especially if the person is new and just learning.” Instead, mlball98 suggests another reason why some slices might appear shorter than others: the first sliced gets squished into the center when the employee is cutting.
In short, maybe don’t chuck the pizza in the garbage just yet."

Whole Foods Market NoMad is set to open its door to the public on June 1. It will be located at 63 Madison Avenue, just between 27th and 28th Street. With a sprawling space of 54,000 square feet, the store will offer more than 1,000 items locally sourced from New York and the surrounding area. Christopher Manca, Whole Foods Market's northeast region's local forager, will be responsible for the selection, which will be hand-picked directly by him.
Local products will be paramount in every section of the store. Vietnamese coffee from Brooklyn-based Nguyen Coffee Supply as well as New York-famous bagels from Black Seed Bagels will be available, and over 20 local farms will provide fresh and organic produce.
There will also be full seafood and meat counters to satisfy every client's needs. They will offer a vast array of locally sourced seafood—like oysters from West Robins Oyster Company—and meats, which will include sausages from Brooklyn Cured Sausage.
Whole Foods Market NoMad will also feature a specialty department that aims at celebrating artisan producers and cheesemakers. Local pastas and cheeses will be available to customers, and a cheese counter equipped with trained cheesemongers will be able to guide every guest with valuable recommendations.
Hungry customers will be able to grab a bite directly at the new store. On-site dining options at Whole Foods Market NoMad range from Mediterranean food—like that of Za'atar—to Yosi Kosher Kitchen and Nomad 63 by Whole Foods Market, which will offer beer, wine, and bar bites. Those wishing to grab a coffee on the fly will be able to do so at the full-service coffee bar operated by Café Grumpy."

NFT marketplace Neon recently launched what appears to be New York City's first NFT vending machine in Manhattan's Financial District. Located at 29 John Street, the pink and blue-hued vending machine accepts credit and debit cards. It sells customers a cardboard box with a QR code inside, which allows you to ""mint"" an NFT artwork on the blockchain via Neon's website.
According to a recent Guardian report, the machine currently dispenses ""color"" NFTs for $5.99 and ""Party Pigeon"" NFTs for $420.69 (yes, really). Both allow users to receive a digital non-fungible token (NFT) representing a certificate of ownership for their purchased artwork created by the blockchain. The color NFTs, of course, don't allow you to own a color, nor do the Party Pigeons let you physically own the grungy pigeons they're hawking.
""It's impossible to own a color,"" said Neon co-founder Jordan Birnholtz to Guardian. ""What you own is a ledger on the Solana blockchain that represents that particular color. And we allow people to collect those colors to trade them, and sell them.""
Neon's vending machine is meant to help first-time users enter the NFT world by allowing you to use dollars instead of crypto, but if the whole concept is still confusing to you, you're not alone.
""Our goal is to support artists and creators by letting them sell digital art to everyone, and to help anyone who wants to become a collector,"" said Birnholtz in a press release. ""Giving people the choice to use vending machines and an easy online platform that decouples cryptocurrency from NFT participation means we can engage the widest possible audience. NFT buying and selling doesn't need to be a mystery.""
Head down to the Financial District to find New York's latest bizarre vending machine, and dip your toe into the world of NFTs."
https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/every-tokyo-restaurant-in-david-changs-ugly-delicious-season-two-031120,Timeout,"Chef and restaurateur David Chang's highly anticipated second season of 'Ugly Delicious' finally hit Netflix on March 6. The new season of his foodie docu-series is just four episodes long – quite a drop from the first season's eight – but Chang still manages to squeeze Tokyo into three out of the four.
The first episode sees Chang visit a Japanese elementary school and sample a typical school lunch in an attempt to prepare for the birth of his first child. It's an emotional start to the series, as Chang and his wife Grace explore the complexities of working in a restaurant while raising a family. It's in the following two episodes that you'll get to see a bit of Tokyo's restaurant scene, and it's clear Chang's love of Japanese food hasn't diminished.
In the episode 'Don't Call It Curry', Chang admits to a lack of knowledge about Indian food and so travels to India with actor Aziz Ansari to get a better grasp of the country's cuisine. Since Japanese curry is very much a thing in its own right, Chang can't resist taking a look at that, too. In a short snippet, chef Shigeharu Hatayama from Katsu to Curry GS in Kasumigaseki talks about what makes Japanese curry, well, Japanese curry. He says it is simply miso that gives his Japanese curry its distinctive taste, although the spices are obviously heavily influenced by Indian cuisine. Hatayama also explains that the longer miso is stewed, the more the umami flavours will emerge.
The 'Steak' episode takes Chang and his foodie friends on a tour of meaty marvels, from the accessibility of a regular Outback Steakhouse, to swanky chophouses like The Beatrice Inn in New York and wagyu institutions such as Keyakizaka in the Grand Hyatt Tokyo. This Tokyo teppanyaki restaurant uses its own signature Keyakizaka beef developed by chef de cuisine Yoshinobu Honda and Takeuchi Farm in Akiruno. The cattle are fed superfoods such as quinoa, seaweed, cacao and blueberries, which result in a premium Kuroge wagyu beef which has the ideal fat-to-lean ratio.
The steakhouse is known for its signature wagyu beef sandwiches – tender slices of meat in between fluffy pieces of shokupan bread. Unfortunately, one does not simply order the Shima wagyu sandwich. To be eligible to buy it, diners must first order a full steak meal at Shima. Only after chowing down on that do you have the option of ordering the prized wagyu sando to take away.
At Yakiniku Jumbo, Chang enjoys a meal with Instagram food influencer Little Meg and has what looks like a life-changing bite of beef as he tries the 'Nohara-yaki', the restaurant's signature sukiyaki-style cut sirloin that's grilled and then dipped in a premium raw egg.
It's quite easy to breeze through these four episodes as well as Chang's other star-studded Netflix show 'Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner', so we hope he decides to grace us with a third season of 'Ugly Delicious' sooner rather than later. Considering how much fun he's had here so far, we expect to see Chang explore even more of Tokyo's food scene in the future.

”Frida Kahlo, The Life of an Icon” is a new experience co-created by the Frida Kahlo Corporation and Spanish digital arts center Layers of Reality set to debut at the Immersive Pavilion in Brooklyn this October.
Those spaces include “infinite symbology, a reactive sensory installation; areas featuring 360º projections and the use of a virtual reality system that will quite literally transport you inside Kahlo’s most famous works.
Prior to its New York debut, the exhibit toured Europe and was also mounted in other American cities, including Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Albuquerque. It is scheduled to proceed to cities in Canada and some Latin American countries.
The exciting piece of news follows an announcement regarding a Broadway-bound show about the star dubbed Frida, The Musical, which is scheduled to premiere in the Theater District in 2024.
Born Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón, the now-iconic painter rose to fame through her many portraits and self-portraits inspired by Mexican artifacts and nature—it was only a matter of time until Kahlo would receive both the Broadway treatment and her very own immersive experience. Here’s to hoping both projects will do her justice.

The 25,000-square-foot space is the former home of concert space House of Vans, which closed back in 2018.
To celebrate the opening of the venue, sure to become part and parcel of New York's larger devotion to all things experiential, AD/BK will host the U.S. premiere of Limitless AI, a 70-minute show that first debuted at the Atelier des Lumières museum in Paris.
Two other shows will be mounted on premise simultaneously: Flight and Séance. Both created by London-based company Darkfield, the two immersive, audio experiences will be presented in complete darkness inside customized 40-foot shipping containers. How cool?
In addition to its function as an exhibit space, the complex will be home to a daytime café that's being marketed as a pre-show destination as well. Visitors will get to enjoy free Wi-Fi and an open-air patio space with outdoor seating.
Also on the docket: an NFT gallery where folks will get to purchase works from main stage shows. AD/BK might therefore become the very first destination in New York to blend two popular trends: NFTs and immersive art.
This isn't the only experiential venue to hit town this summer. Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank, the oldest savings bank in New York City, is actually turning into a giant new center for custom-designed immersive art experiences dubbed Hall des Lumières (yes, it's connected to the above-mentioned French iteration of the space). Although the latter destination isn't yet open to the public, those interested can already purchase tickets for the inaugural exhibit, which will focus on Gustav Klimt, right here.
Creatives are betting big on experiences all around the city these, clearly identifying a public craving for things to do and feel over, perhaps, places to go to. Whether that is a result of a pandemic that forced us to relinquish experiential events for nearly two years is, at this point, irrelevant.

Is there an explosion of jaywalking tickets being handed out everywhere else in this country? Seriously, why is it so taboo to not just use common sense and cross when it's clear everywhere else?
A real New Yorker will walk right past free of harassment, but a fake New Yorker will be sensed and handed a mixtape. Never take the mixtape.
Whether a chain like Five Guys or Shake Shack or a New York institution like Minetta Tavern you need to have a strong enough opinion that you're willing to fight with your friends.
It may seem dirty to an outsider, but these hot dog and halal carts are providing on-the-go meals to real New Yorkers.
A numbered address is akin to hieroglyphics. Give a person the intersection and then it's up to them to figure it out.
The nice thing about New York is no matter if you want a bagel, burger or salad there are multiple great options within the city. We don't wait in line for some instafamous spot.

New Yorkers hoping to ride the subway partly naked this year should think of other plans as, just as was the case last year, the annual No Pants Subway Ride has been canceled.
""The No Pants Subway Ride is not happening in New York in 2023,"" reads a message on the initiative's official website. ""After 19 years of producing the event, we've decided to take a break (sadly the pandemic ruined our plans of making it 20 years in a row!).""
The first year that Improv Everywhere, the comedic performance art group behind the effort, asked New Yorkers to commute with only their underwear and jackets on was 2002. Two decades ago, there were only seven participants, all of whom were men. ""They pretended not to notice each other and, if asked, claimed that they just forgot' their pants,"" reads a history of the event on the site.
The gimmick picked up media steam throughout the years: the 2004 event was filmed by ABC News 20/20 and, the year after, This American Life did the same thing for its series on Showtime.
The last No Pants Subway Ride in New York happened on January 12, 2020, in pretty ridiculous 65-degree weather.
As explained by Improv Everywhere, the ""idea behind No Pants is simple: random passengers board a subway car at separate stops in the middle of winter without pants. The participants behave as if they do not know each other, and they all wear winter coats, hats, scarves and gloves. The only unusual thing is their lack of pants.""

The only caveat is that they're not available nationwide—yet. Four Loko is rolling out Pregame across the Southeast in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee. Though, in the latter state, the product will only be 10% ABV due to state regulations.
If you're not quite ready to dive in with the shots (I get it), there's always that hard seltzer to dip your toes in the Four Loko pond.

https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/nyc-rents-are-going-down-after-huge-increases,Thrillist,"New York City, this is not a drill. Rent prices are (very slowly) going down, at least for now.
After a summer where moving to a new apartment or renegotiating your lease felt like facing NYC's final boss, the rental market seems to be cooling off a tiny bit. According to the apartment rental website Zumper, the median NYC rent dropped 2.3% between September and October. A separate report from The Real Deal estimates that the national median decreased .07% for one-bedrooms and 0.8% for two-bedroom apartments.
Earlier this summer, NYC witnessed rent increases both for rent-stabilized apartments and for market-rate units. Tenants living in rent-stabilized homes were hit with the steepest increase in prices in over a decade, and saw one-year leases go up by 3.25%, while the board voted for a 5% increase on two-year leases. Meanwhile, market rates went through the roof after a period of intense decline brought on by the initial COVID-19 lockdowns.
Rent increases have been slapping New Yorkers even harder than one might think when considering the role inflation played. According to a recent StreetEasy study, the gap between real wage growth and rent prices in August was 23% when taking inflation into account. StreetEasy found that real wages actually decreased by 9.1% because of inflation, while rent prices hiked 13.4%, which creates the widest gap since the 2008 housing crisis.
Even though a 2.3% drop might seem a minimal, it is a hopeful change for the sky-high rental market. Appraiser Jonathan Miller told Curbed that, according to his analysis, the slight change could lead to a more balanced rental market in which broker fees might lower and bidding wars could stop. Although the actual decrease is small, it could be a sign of better things to come."
https://www.timeout.com/usa/news/stunning-photos-of-the-aurora-borealis-above-the-us-033122,Timeout,"Last night, the sky above the US exploded with a light show typically reserved for other countries (and Alaska): Aurora Borealis, known as the Northern Lights. These displays of neon greens that resemble a cresting wave or a holographic light show from Mars actually happen year-round, but we only get to see them in late winter and early spring when the Arctic is darkest and the sky clearest.
On Wednesday night, social media lit up with images from the rare experience happening across the northwest states.
The science behind Aurora Borealis is pretty interesting. The sun emits electrically charged particles that run into oxygen and nitrogen in the earth’s upper atmosphere. When enough of these celestial fender-benders occur, nitrogen will discharge a blue light and oxygen a greenish-yellow or even red one. The other colors you see are from these lights blending.
It’s rare to see the Northern Lights in the northwest, but last night’s show was courtesy of a strong geomagnetic storm from the sun. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration logged two eruptions on the sun’s surface earlier in the week, as reported by USA Today, that sent huge clouds of charged particles towards our planet. These coronal mass ejections sound impressive and let some of us host Aurora Borealis in our own sky rather than on the computer.
If you didn’t catch them last night, you can perhaps take comfort in the fact that the actual light show isn’t quite as spectacular as what you see with the naked eye. Camera have more photo receptors than our peepers, so the astounding colors captured on film may appear in real life more like fifty shades of gray. It’s also the case that the Northern Lights can deepen and become more impressive as the night wears on — and also that some people, depending on their vision, can see a better version of it even when standing next to someone else having a lesser experience. Moreover, some photographers keep their shutters open for 15 seconds or more, creating an image that benefits from the intake of far more light, and thus more color, than our own human eyes."

For close to two years, shoppers were able to purchase and take home portable home furnishing accessories curated specifically for New Yorkers with ""inspiring"" room sets and digital tools focused on sustainable, small-space living. Customers also had the chance to set up home delivery services for an affordable flat fee, schedule appointments with IKEA employees to figure out how to properly organize their kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms.

As the long-reigning host of Top Chef and Taste the Nation, Padma Lakshmi clearly knows a thing or two about food. But the rightfully self-anointed New Yorker (“I came here when I was 4 and I am a child of the city,” she says), who was born in India, is also fluent in the nuances that make her adopted town so special.
The two distinctions render her the ideal personality to helm KIND's new speakeasy-style pop-up restaurant at Chelsea Market next week.
Open to the public for a limited time from February 28 through March 1 between noon and 8pm, the secret destination will be accessible by all guests for free as long as they complete a small act of kindness by the door on the ground floor of the market at 410 West 16th Street by 9th Avenue.
Inside, patrons will get to shop for fresh produce a variety of delicious KIND bars and sample specialty-created dishes by Lakshmi herself for the occasion, including a lentil salad on leaves of endive, a butternut squash toast and delectable fruit and almond bites.
Ahead of the activation, Lakshmi gets candid about what makes New York so special, her favorite local restaurants, go-to supermarkets and more.
""My biggest tip involves prep. On the weekends, I will chop up extra veggies that I know I will use throughout the week: bell peppers, ginger, onions, garlic. I will keep them in bags and glass containers. I will even boil lentils and use them throughout the week.
""First, a molcajete, which is a mortar and pestle from Mexico that's more rough than the average one and is good for grinding spices, which is a nice thing to do by hand.
You should also invest in a hand blender that you can just plug in. It's so much more easy to clean and use than a traditional blender. I use it a lot for soups.
The third would be a microplane, which looks like a long skinny wand and is used to grate really fine things like lemon zest and Parmesan. It has changed my life! I can now add orange or lime zest to all my salads.""
""Kalustyan's on 123 Lexington Avenue is where my mom used to shop and I have been shopping there my whole life. Even if you don't go into the store, it's part of the Indian section of town, where there are a lot of other shops that I recommend people explore.
If you're in Queens, go to Patel Brothers. They also have a location in Jersey City.
I also love Essex Market, which is my local market. They have Latin finds, a Japanese store, an Italian butcher downstairs and even a whole cheese shop that only sells vegan products.""
""La Mercerie is a French restaurant downtown at 53 Howard Street that I love. It's a beautiful room, it's helmed by a female chef and it offers really nice French food without being fussy. I also like it because it opens early so you can have a morning meeting there and it's inside Roman and Williams Guild, so you can browse through home goods while on premise.
I also love Indochine at 430 Lafayette Street. I had my 40th birthday party there, where you can eat spicy and delicious food that is also healthy. That's the thing: people think you can either eat healthy or delicious, but that's not true. You can have both!""
""Other cities are diverse but the various communities don't intermingle like they do here in New York. I have traveled and I can say that nowhere else in the world has such a concentration of a variety of cultures in such a small area. New York really is an international place.
We are not without our problems—it's expensive to live here, for example!—but, more than any other city, the cultures come together here."""

Just a few weeks ago, news broke that a Staten Island Ferry (yes, an actual one) was up for sale. Staten Island's unofficial mayor, Pete Davidson, and his Saturday Night Live pal Colin Jost ended up purchasing the thing for $280,100. But if you still have a desire to use your cash for something incredibly odd, this might interest you: a former zoo in the Catskills has just hit the market for $3.6 million.
The 193-acre Catskill Game Farm used to actually be the country's oldest privately owned zoo, once welcoming as many as 500,000 visitors per year.
A bit more about the property's pretty cool history: it first opened back in 1933 and was home to a slew of sheeps, deers and donkeys. According to Curbed, it achieved ""official zoo status"" in the late 1950s, at which point a number of exotic animals took up residence there—including alligators, hippos, kangaroos, camels, llamas, ""prehistoric horses"" (we're not entirely sure what those are) and mountain lions.
The destination closed down in 2006 and, a few years later, in 2012, Cathy and Ben Ballone purchased it and turned it into the six-bedroom Long Neck Inn. The area surrounding the inn was converted to four luxury campsites.
But it doesn't end there: in 2020, a group of investors purchased the site for $1.86 million hoping to continue using it as a hotel while offering other outdoor activities on premise. Although the 9,000-square-foot inn was then available on Airbnb, the pandemic obviously affected the owners' long-term plans.
Now, that same group of investors has put the property up for sale for almost double the price it paid for it just two years ago. Is the cost too steep for the property to sell? We're not real estate experts but if the sale of the Staten Island Ferry and the city's devotion to all things ""old New York"" are of any indication, we're sure there are some buyers already lined up for this one.

Governors Island continues to be the hottest destination in New York this season, with a new beach club dubbed Gitano Island officially staking its claim in the area. The effort follows the Tulum-inspired tropical jungle restaurant, Gitano Garden of Love, that operated four successful seasons smack-dab in the middle of SoHo in Manhattan. The original iteration of the seasonal restaurant and beach club is actually based in the Mexican city.
The new venue on Governors Island will open in June and take over 27,000-square-feet of space on the island, right next to the ferry terminal overlooking the Manhattan skyline.
Warning: When visiting, you'll feel like you've traveled to Mexico via ferry. Expect 30-feet-tall coconut palm trees to line your surroundings, plus a mezcal bar, two dining patios, a state-of-the-art DJ tent and a VIP all centered around a serene water feature.
According to the New York Post, the team is shipping in 350 tons of sand in order to create the tropical paradise in the middle of the New York Harbor. James Gardner, the founder and CEO of Grupo Gitano, tells the outlet that, at the end of the season, he expects to donate all the plants and trees to the island itself or to local schools (the sand, though, will stay in place).
Just like the SoHo iteration of the project, this one will also feature giant disco balls, the iconic GITANO pink neon sign and delicious cocktails with kitschy names to the island.
Gitano Island will actually be the very first destination to serve dinner on Governors Island, thanks to the extended ferry service (6pm through midnight starting this summer).
The news follows the opening of the much-anticipated Italian luxury spa that has also taken residence on Governors Island—QC NY opened to much fanfare back in March—and the announcement that luxury glamping will also be back for the season.

Chipotle has officially shut down one particularly beautiful loophole, though, marking an end to the burrito bowl's glory days. Before now, hungry customers could order a burrito bowl, which holds more filling than a burrito, and ask for a warm tortilla on the side, which came at no added charge. This prevented people from having to choose between the heftiness of a burrito bowl and the tasty carbs of a burrito. Why pick one when you can enjoy the best of both?
As of Monday, the free side tortilla ceased to exist. In its place? A 25-cent tortilla on the side. One single quarter is a small price to pay, but painful nonetheless.
What does this change mean for devotees of the burrito-bowl-with-a-side-tortilla?

https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/mcdonalds-spicy-bbq-chicken-sandwich-review-taste-test,Thrillist,"Although the summer of the chicken sandwich is receding, McDonald's is hoping to get a bite of the buzz with its brand-new Spicy BBQ Chicken Sandwich. It's not a standard fried chicken sandwich with a plain chicken patty and pickles (like Popeyes' coveted sandwich), but its spiciness makes it an exciting addition to the fast food giant's menu.
I'm interested in why McDonald's went with a BBQ chicken sandwich, rather than capitalizing on the hype that still surrounds Nashville hot chicken or doubling down on a traditional, spicy chicken sandwich with pickles that's not submerged in sauce. Whatever the case, I was pleasantly surprised by McDonald's iteration of a spicy BBQ chicken sandwich. It miraculously hit all the right notes and genuinely tasted agreeable, though was admittedly messy to get into.
BBQ is not my sauce of choice for chicken. I'm typically a honey mustard or ranch type of girl, and would never go out of my way to order BBQ sauce for anything (except, you know, barbecue). But this BBQ sauce was admirable; it offered deep smokiness and plenty of heat -- the type that creates a warming sensation on your tongue, but doesn't make you sweat and curse. The sauce was plentiful on the sandwich, oozing out between the sesame seed buns and sticky on my fingers, yet the chicken patty retained a crispy, satisfying exterior. I appreciated that. Too often, glazed fried chicken is reduced to soggy, unappealing afterthoughts.
The pickles provided a nice tang to cut through the sweetness of the sauce and gave some extra crunch, alongside the onions. I do love raw onions to counterbalance an overwhelming sauce, but I have to admit the slivers were not my favorite addition. For starters, as slivers instead of diced squares, I found the onion pieces to be too slippery, awkwardly splayed out over the chicken patty before sliding out and dropping to the bottom of McDonald's cardboard boxed carriers. Additionally, the onions didn't have enough of that quintessential raw bite. McDonald's didn't share what type of onions it uses for this sandwich on its website. Its flavor, however, was akin to a yellow onion; gentle and sweet and almost apple-like. I would have preferred the intensity of a white onion.
In addition to the new Spicy BBQ Chicken Sandwich, McDonald's also debuted glazed tenders. Instead of a drizzle of the smoky BBQ sauce, the tenders are tossed to order and completely covered in sticky sweet glaze. Since I was already at McDonald's, I figured I'd try the tenders too and give you the lowdown.
The tenders are skippable. There's nothing else to help combat the overwhelming flavor of BBQ sauce; no pickles, no onions, no soft buns to absorb and dial back some of the flavor. Instead, you're left with tenders that have become a tad soggy thanks to their submersion in sauce and offer no reprieve from sweet and smoky flavors.
McDonald's is offering the Spicy BBQ Glazed Tenders and Spicy BBQ Chicken Sandwich only for a limited time, so if you're a BBQ sauce fiend and ready to continue gorging on all types of chicken sandwich iterations, make sure you fit this newest menu item in your rotation.

https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/is-the-largest-menorah-in-the-world-found-in-brooklyn-or-manhattan-120221,Timeout,"Every year as Hanukkah—the Jewish festival of lights, latkes, donuts and dreidels—rolls around in NYC, a conversation takes place regarding two massive menorahs located across the East River from one another in the city.
Fun fact: although commonly referred to as a menorah, the nine-tiered lampstand that Jews light up for eight nights in a row during the holiday is technically called a hanukkiah (menorahs have seven tiers in total). The shamash, usually placed in the middle or at one far end of the menorah, is lit every night alongside one additional candle daily.
A beautiful tradition beloved by kids and adults alike, the lighting of the hanukkiah is ranked pretty high on ""best things to do"" lists throughout the holiday season and so it is no surprise that destinations across New York host their very own nightly lighting ceremonies for eight straight days.
Two particular lighting events are considered by many to be the most trafficked around New York: One located at Grand Army Plaza in Prospect Heights and the other at Grand Army Plaza in midtown Manhattan. However, these two menorahs have both, at one point, called themselves: ""The Largest Menorah in the World.""
Alas, that ""dispute"" has now been resolved. Following our investigation, we learned that, in fact, the candelabra in Manhattan is the tallest one in the world—but we couldn't help but dive a bit deeper into the matter.
Some history: Grand Army Plaza in Manhattan is found near Central Park, at Fifth Avenue between West 58th and West 59th Streets, and the first hanukkiah was erected there back in 1973 by one Rabbi Shmuel Butman. According to Patch.com, this specific lampstand was designed by famous Israeli artist Yaacov Agam and it is made of steel, weighing roughly 4,000 pounds.
Although a preliminary Google search yields results suggesting that the height of this particular lampstand is 32 feet, Rabbi Motti Seligson, the Director of Public Relations at Chabad, confirms that number to actually be 36 feet.
Over a decade after the erection of the Manhattan hannukiah, in 1984, one Rabbi Shimon Hecht built another one that still stands tall at Grand Army Plaza in Prospect Heights. This one is officially 32 feet high, a fact that corroborates the Manhattan location's claim to fame (the Guinness Book of World Records did bestow the candelabra with the coveted title back in 2006). In fact, the Brooklyn channukiah now boasts a plaque that reads: ""Largest Menorah in Brooklyn.""
Despite all of the above, according to official Jewish law, the maximum height for a hannukiah is 32 feet. Which means that, although the one in Manhattan is technically the largest one in the world, the one in Brooklyn can be considered the largest kosher one around."

It can be hard to keep track of who is doing what and when.
With this new interactive page, you can search by name of restaurant, borough and zip code, as well even check out whether your desired spot is serving alcohol. At the time of publication, a graph on the page demonstrates that, currently, there are 266 open restaurants in the Bronx, 1,400 in Brooklyn, 2,800 in Manhattan, 1,100 in Queens and 112 in Staten Island. If it interests you, you can even find out when spots applied for their outdoor license. And of course, businesses interested in applying for their own permits for outdoor dining can also find information on the site as well (at Mayor Bill de Blasio's press conference this morning, it was announced that at least 5,500 restaurants had applied for permits so far).

The famous Staten Island mansion that was featured in the 1972 classic The Godfather will soon open its doors to guests, and it will be available to be booked on Airbnb for a long-term stay throughout the month of August.
A cinephile-favorite, the gorgeous home located in Todt Hill served as Don Corleone's house in the iconic movie. Now, it's about to become fully available to one lucky renter who manages to snag a booking. The Tudor-style mansion, which was built in 1930, will grant its guests access to the entire property, from the five bedrooms to the seven bathrooms and the pool area, among other amenities. The price won't be too steep, either, with each night costing $50. The total for 30 nights will be $1,500 plus taxes and fees.
The limited-time offer comes in honor of the movie's 50th anniversary, which inspired the latest owners—who purchased the property in 2016 for $2,400,000—to rent it out for the month. A maximum of five guests will be able to vacation at the mansion, and children are allowed. While the house's facade and external appearance remained unchanged, the property has undergone renovations and is ""completely modernized,"" according to the Airbnb description.
Bookings will open on July 27 at 9 am for a 30-night stay from August 1 through August 31. For more information and to try your luck at booking the mansion, you can visit the Airbnb listing."

During this year's Hanukkah celebration, NYC is lighting up the largest menorah in the world.
Standing at 36 feet of height, the massive structure, which has been certified by the Guinness World Records, will be placed like every year by the east entrance of Central Park (5th Avenue and 59th Street). Lightings will occur every night of Hanukkah, and they will come together with fun celebrations. This year, Hasidic dancing and light music will bring the community together, and the Lubavitch Youth Organization will be in charge of entertainment."

https://www.eater.com/23658826/michelin-guide-great-britain-ireland-restaurant-stars-london-2023,Eater,"Today, the Michelin Guide announced its 2023 awards for Great Britain and Ireland, returning to its pre-pandemic format of an in-person ceremony also streamed online. While no restaurants in the region were newly awarded three stars this year, all of the guide’s eight three-star restaurants — including London’s Restaurant Gordon Ramsay and Core by Clare Smyth — maintained their distinction, unlike recent upsets in France and the United States.
Joining the Ledbury as new additions to the two-star category are Alex Dilling at Hotel Café Royal in London — which Eater London once described as offering “all things fine, fancy, and flash” — and chef Ahmet Dede’s Turkish-inflected Dede in Baltimore, Ireland.
Michelin added 20 restaurants to the one star category, including Cycene, Taku, and Luca in London. Across the regions, four restaurants gained recognition for their sustainability efforts as part of Michelin’s green star awards.
Today’s news follows the addition of 20 new restaurants to Michelin’s value-focused Bib Gourmand category last week. In a statement, Michelin’s international director Gwendal Poullennec acknowledged the success of these restaurants in finding “inventive ways to create affordable menus and keep costs down for their guests” amid rising day-to-day costs.
The full list of winners can be found on Michelin’s website."
https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/japanese-market-50-norman-opens-greenpoint-brooklyn,Thrillist,"New Yorkers who are looking to get a little taste of Tokyo can avoid the 14-hour long flight time and head over to Greenpoint instead.
50 Norman, a new and authentic Japanese marketplace, just opened at (you guessed it) 50 Norman Street, and it brings the true essence of three different Tokyo brands to the city. Sprawling across 3,500 square feet and designed by acclaimed Japanese architect Jo Nagasaka, 50 Norman features a space dedicated to lifestyle and art, culture, and dining, with all three brands debuting for the first time in New York.
The wooden features of the space are reminiscent of traditional architecture, and they are built using selected woods from a demolished Kyoto house to truly bring the Japanese essence to the space. Enclosed by these walls are Cibone, Dashi Okume, and House Brooklyn, which together welcome visitors into a proper Japanese experience.
Cibone (which is pronounced Cee-bo-nay) is your new go-to for anything art, culture, and lifestyle coming directly from Japanese culture. Featuring items of both classic and contemporary Japanese craftsmanship, the store offers anything ranging from colorful ceramics by Yoshinori Takemura to Oigen's traditional Nambu cast iron kettles and even authentic meditating Japanese igusa tatami mat by Ikehiko. Cibone also highlights up-and-coming artists, so make sure to stop by to take a look at new artworks for your home.
At Dashi Okume, guests will be able to get the highest quality dashi and seafood products in the city. Dashi Okume is owned by Okume, a traditional and renowned seafood business in Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market since 1871. The store is the first place in the US specializing in dashi, and it is also the only place where customers can order their own blend selection of dashi packs, which the staff will grind in front of them. Pre-made dashi packs are also available, and those looking to grab a bite of comfort Japanese food can do so at the Dashi Okume bar and table seats.
For another dining experience, House Brooklyn will be ready to satisfy every palate. Set to open in late October, the restaurant is located behind Cibone, and it features a very intimate space with eight seats. Helmed by Kyoto-native Chef Yuji Tani, House Brooklyn will will be offering a nine-course omakase tasting menu, with seasonal dishes inspired by both the Japanese and French cuisines. Guests will be able to sit across from the kitchen where Chef Tani will create every course."
https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/this-scenic-train-through-the-adirondacks-officially-returns-on-april-4-032323,Timeout,"It’s been rated as one of the most scenic train rides in the world.
An Amtrak train route that has been named one of the “Top 10 Most Scenic Train Rides in the World” by National Geographic is coming back after a three-year pause.
Adirondak service resumed just to Albany on December 5, but when it returns on April 4, it’ll offer a beautiful ride through the mountains, from NYC’s Moynihan Train Hall at Penn Station all the way to Montreal, Quebec’s Gare Centrale/Central Station, covering 400 miles in 10 hours.
RECOMMENDED: I took the new, 8-hour Amtrak train to Burlington, Vermont. Here’s why it was worth it.
According to the Montreal Gazette, it’ll stop at Yonkers, Croton-Harmon, Poughkeepsie, Rhinecliff, Hudson, Albany-Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga Springs, Fort Edward, Whitehall, Ticonderoga, Port Henry, Westport, Port Kent, Plattsburgh, Rouses Point, St-Lambert, Quebec, and Montreal. It’s a 10-hour ride from beginning to end but is worth it if you want your journey to be as scenic as your destination.
The Gazette says it is “popular with Montrealers and New Yorkers.” In 2019, the route had 117,000 passengers, which was a 5% jump from the previous year. But it hasn’t stopped in Montreal since 2020, when it was shut down during the pandemic. Service to Albany only resumed in December 2022.
The first northbound Adirondack train will depart Moynihan Train Hall at New York Penn Station at 8:41am on April 3 and scheduled to arrive at Montreal’s Central Station at 8:16pm. The first southbound train will leave Montreal at 11:10am on April 4, with a scheduled arrival in New York at 10:15pm, according to the Gazette.
“Whether you’re experiencing the greatness of New York City, the culture of Montreal or the beauty of the Hudson Valley and Lake Champlain region, the return of the Adirondack provides customers with a reliable, relaxing and sustainable way to travel,” said Amtrak President Roger Harris."
