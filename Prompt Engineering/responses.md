# Stage 2: Final Result:
"
The year 2017 marked the release of the game, and yet, as we find ourselves in 2021, an update remains elusive. However, the impending release on Game Pass has seemingly spurred Square Enix into action. An announcement of a patch for the Steam version was made in April, but the lack of a specified release date has left fans in a state of anticipation, questioning when Square Enix will finally address the issue.

The expectation was that these features would have been operational at the time of launch, or at the very least, shortly thereafter. It is unfortunate that fans have been left waiting for four years, and even more so that they have had to resort to community-created solutions in the absence of official support.

Square Enix's long-awaited update for the 2017 game is yet to materialize, despite us being well into 2021. However, the imminent Game Pass release appears to have prompted some action from the company. A patch for the Steam version was declared in April, but the absence of a concrete release date has left fans in a state of uncertainty, questioning when Square Enix will finally address the issue.

Ideally, these features should have been fully functional at the time of launch, or shortly thereafter. It is regrettable that fans have been left in limbo for four years, and even more so that they have had to rely on community-generated solutions in the absence of official support.
