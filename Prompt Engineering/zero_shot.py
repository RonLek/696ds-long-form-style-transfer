      "content": "SOURCE:\n\"Square (SQ) and Stripe have emerged as two popular payment processing services for small and growing businesses. Square focuses largely on in-person payments while Stripe was designed for online transactions. As the services have become widely used, their simple fixed-rate payment processing fees have drawn in big-name supporters to use and promote their systems. For investors and business owners, it\\u2019s important to understand how these companies operate to make smart financial decisions in the rapidly shifting payment processing industry.\\nSquare has been widely adopted by mobile and brick-and-mortar businesses alike. To further extend its reach among the latter, Square released a physical Square Stand in May 2013 that transforms iPads into traditional cash registers.\\nThe company has also built out its software suite to better handle diverse product sales from a predefined menu or inventory. Thought there have still been some reports of this system freezing. Later product additions include inventory management, appointment management, analytics, invoicing, online ordering, gift cards, and capital management tools.\\nWhat Square is to mobile payment processing, Stripe is to Internet payment processing. Stripe, which was founded in 2010 by two Irish entrepreneurs, charges 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction with discounts available for high-volume clients.89 Like Square, Stripe doesn\\u2019t have any monthly service fees and only charges business owners when a payment is processed.\\nStripe, which was designed with online developers in mind, makes it easy to integrate a variety of online payment processing tools and plugins through its API. Sites on common platforms like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla can use Stripe for invoice payments, ticket sales, and physical goods sales, among other applications.\\nBoth companies target all businesses that do not want to pay monthly transaction fees and do not want to be burdened with expensive payment processing equipment or complex contracts. Both companies offer similar, automated direct deposits within a few days of processing each transaction, so clients will have fast access to cash after each payment takes place.\\nSquare does still offer slightly lower costs, at a rate of 2.6% plus $0.10 per transaction, while Stripe charges a flat rate of 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction.49 This difference in fees relates to the difference in products. Online payments have a greater risk for fraud than in-person transactions, meaning Stipe has increased costs when it comes to protecting against this possibility.\\nSquare was designed specifically for in-person, on-the-go transactions, using a payment processing adapter that acts as a card reader and can plug into phones, tablets and other devices. The company also offers some Internet payment processing options through its online platform Cash App. However, this is focused on person-to-person payments rather than online business transactions.\\nStripe, on the other hand, was designed specifically to make processing Internet transactions easier. The company is able to bring together many different online processing tools and plugins to work for a variety of Internet-focused businesses. It also now offers an in-person payment tool, Terminal, but online payments still remain Stripe's main focus.\\nSquare and Stripe are major disruptors in traditional payment processing, a space long dominated by large banks. Overturning the traditional monthly merchant account fees and transaction fees allows many more businesses to access credit and debit customers, further shifting the competitive landscape from traditional businesses to startups and growing small to medium-sized companies.\\nAs these companies continue to innovate and add new products such as loans, consumers and business owners can expect further changes that will make payment processing easier and more accessible. As cash becomes less prevalent and consumers continue to shift towards plastic en masse, these electronic payment processing companies can be expected to grow and more competitors are likely to enter the space.\\nHowever, for online-only businesses, Stripe may be a better choice since it was designed to focus entirely on Internet payment processing.\\nSquare and Stripe offer payment processing services. These services are specifically designed for use by small and growing businesses.\\nSquare works, predominantly, through a small adapter that plugs into a cell phone or other device. It can process card payments and handle a wide range of product sales. There is a $0.10 processing fee per transaction and a flat rate charge of 2.6%.\\nStripe, on the other hand, focuses on helping businesses more easily process online transactions. It also recently created Terminal, an on-site debit and credit card reader that works much like Square's device. There is a $0.30 fee per transaction and a 2.9% flat rate charge.\\nSquare is geared toward in-person transactions so it is the best option for business owners who need to process payments on the go. Stripe focuses mainly on Internet transactions, therefore it's the best option for those who conduct the majority of their business digitally.\\nInvestopedia examined multiple data points from both companies, such as fees, ease of use, company history, and intended purpose of their services, to make this comparison. In addition, we examined each company's role and impact on the banking and payment processing industry overall.\\nTechCrunch. \\\"Square Opens at $11.20, Up 24% on Its IPO Price of $9, Raising $243M.\\\"\\nSquare. \\\"Square, Inc.

Make no mistake: you're facing long odds and steep risks.\\nBut even if you're just dabbling in the market with a few extra dollars, it's important to understand the basics so you don't get in over your head.\\nEstablish your strategy before you start. Losing money scares people into making bad decisions, and you have to lose money sometimes when you day trade. Having an exit plan for each of your investment holdings is important because it helps you avoid making an emotional decision when you need to make a rational decision.\\nBe patient. Look for trading opportunities that meet your strategic criteria. If the situation doesn\\u2019t meet it, don\\u2019t trade. You don\\u2019t have to trade if nothing looks attractive.\\nRead, read, read. Continually watch what\\u2019s happening in the markets. Big news \\u2014 even unrelated to your investments \\u2014 could change the whole tenor of the market, moving your positions without any company-specific news.\\n\\u00bb Wondering where to day trade? Review NerdWallet\\u2019s picks of the best brokers for day trading.\\nIf you\\u2019re not quite ready to be a prime-time player, you can always try paper trading with a stock market simulator first. Paper trading involves fake stock trades, which let you see how the market works before risking real money. Paper trading accounts are available at many brokerages. You can also get a feel for the broker\\u2019s platform and functionality with this approach, in addition to seeing how theoretically profitable you'd be.\\nYou'll need to determine the best trading strategy for you. You may wish to specialize in a specific strategy or mix and match from among some of the following typical strategies.\\nTraders find a stock that tends to bounce around between a low and a high price, called a \\\"range bound\\\" stock, and they buy when it nears the low and sell when it nears the high. They may also sell short when the stock reaches the high point, trying to profit as the stock falls to the low and then close out the short position.\\nThis high-speed technique tries to profit on temporary changes in sentiment, exploiting the difference in the bid-ask price for a stock, also called a spread. For example, if a buyer\\u2019s bid price drops suddenly, the day trader might step in to buy and then try to quickly resell at the stock\\u2019s ask price or higher, earning a small \\u201cspread\\u201d on the transaction.\\nThis sees a trader short-selling a stock that has gone up too quickly when buying interest starts to wane. The trader might close the short position when the stock falls or when buying interest picks up.\\nThis strategy tries to ride the wave of a stock that\\u2019s moving, either up or down, perhaps to due to an earnings report or some other news. Traders will buy a rising stock or \\u201cfade\\u201d a falling one, anticipating that the momentum will continue.\\nHow you execute these strategies is up to you. Some traders might angle for a penny per share, like spread traders, while others need to see a larger profit before closing a position, like swing traders. Some traders might be willing to hold overnight, while others won\\u2019t and prefer to maintain a neutral position in case bad news hits before they can react.\\nTo know when to trade, day traders closely watch a stock\\u2019s order flow, the list of potential orders lining up to buy and sell a stock. Before buying, they\\u2019ll look for a stock to fall to \\u201csupport,\\u201d a stock price at which other buyers step in to buy, and the stock is more likely to rise. To sell, they\\u2019ll look for when the stock hits \\u201cresistance,\\u201d a price where more traders start selling and the price is more likely to fall. To make judgments like this, you\\u2019ll want a broker that lets you see order flow.\\nWhichever strategy you pick, it's important to find one (or more) that work and that you have the confidence to use. It can take a while to find a strategy that works for you, and even then the market may change, forcing you to change your approach.\\nStocks are among the most popular securities for day traders \\u2014  the market is big and active, and commissions are relatively low or nonexistent. You can also day trade bonds, options, futures, commodities and currencies.\\nGood volume. Day traders like stocks because they\\u2019re liquid, meaning they trade often and in high volume. Liquidity allows a trader to buy and sell without affecting the price much. Currency markets are also highly liquid.\\nSome volatility \\u2014 but not too much. Volatility means the security's price changes frequently. This kind of movement is necessary for a day trader to make any profit. Someone has to be willing to pay a different price after you take a position.\\nNewsworthiness. Media coverage gets people interested in buying or selling a security. That helps create volatility and liquidity. Many day traders follow the news to find ideas on which they can act.\\nDay traders who focus on stocks often rely on \\u201ctechnical analysis,\\u201d or analyzing the movements of stocks on a chart, rather than \\u201cfundamental analysis,\\u201d which involves examining company factors such as its products, industry and management. While some day traders might exchange dozens of different securities in a day, others stick to just a few \\u2014 and get to know those well. This knowledge helps you gauge when to buy and sell, how a stock has traded in the past and how it might trade in the future.\\nDay traders need liquidity and volatility, and the stock market offers those most frequently in the hours after it opens, from 9:30 a.m. to about noon ET, and then in the last hour of trading before the close at 4 p.m. ET.\\nAs to the best time to trade for profitability, theories abound, but what can\\u2019t be disputed is the concentration of trades that bookend the regular market session. An analysis from the Jefferies Group showed that in 2018, 25% of average daily trading volume took place in the last 30 minutes of regular trading hours, excluding the closing auction, while 5.5% took place in the first 30 minutes.\\nA day trader might make 100 to a few hundred trades in a day, depending on the strategy and how frequently attractive opportunities appear. With so many trades, it\\u2019s important that day traders keep costs low \\u2014 our online broker comparison tool can help narrow the options.\\nPosition sizing. If the trade goes wrong, how much will you lose?\\nPercentage of your portfolio. Closely related to position sizing, how much will your overall portfolio suffer if a position goes bad?\\nLosses. What level of losses are you willing to endure before you sell?\\nSelling. After making a profitable trade, at what point do you sell?\\nEven with a good strategy and the right securities, trades will not always go your way. It\\u2019s important to have a plan for when to close a position, whether it's purely mechanical \\u2014 for example, sell after it goes up or down X% \\u2014 or based on how the stock or market is trading that day.\\nProper risk management prevents small losses from turning into large ones and preserves capital for future trades. But that means traders have to be willing to realize a loss, which is hard for many traders to accept, even though it\\u2019s essential to long-term survival.\\nDay trading is just one way to approach the stock market \\u2014 and it\\u2019s hardly worthwhile for most investors.\\nConversely, investors who buy and hold low-cost index funds that track a broad market index like the S&P 500 could see higher returns over a long period. Historically, the S&P 500 has an annualized total return of about 10%, not accounting for inflation.\\nIf you're going to day trade, It's paramount to set aside a certain amount of money you can afford to lose. Don\\u2019t trade more than that amount or use the mortgage or rent money.\\nNerdWallet\\u2019s guide on how to invest money.\\nLearn how to buy stocks.\\nOur round-up of the best brokers for stock trading.\\nIf you execute four or more day trades \\u2014 that is, trades in which you buy and sell a security the same day \\u2014 within a five-business-day period, and those trades represent more than 6% of your total trades in that period, you'll be designated as a pattern day trader.\\nThat means you'll have to maintain a minimum equity level of $25,000 in your margin account any time you day trade. That $25,000 can consist of cash, securities or both. You also may have your buying power restricted.\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says that day traders \\\"typically suffer severe financial losses in their first months of trading, and many never graduate to profit-making status.[1]Securities and Exchange Commission.
